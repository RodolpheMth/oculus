https://t.co/lQ8Q3kZLxa,2021-01-28T08:17:54,WhatsApp adds biometric authentication to its web and desktop versions,"['WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned popular messaging app with more than 2 billion users, has been getting a lot of heat and losing users in recent weeks after announcing (and then delaying) changes to how it uses your data. It’s not done with how it’s tweaking privacy and security. Now, it’s adding a new biometric feature to the service to bring in a new authentication layer for those using its web and desktop versions.The company said that from today, it will let people add in a fingerprint, face, or iris scan to use WhatsApp on desktop or web by linking it to your mobile app, to be used alongside the existing QR code authentication.The feature is coming on the heels of what WhatsApp is describing as a “visual refresh” of the WhatsApp web page on the Android and iOS apps for linking and managing devices connected to your account. The company hints there will be more updates coming soon.With the new feature, you will now be able to add in a biometric login, which uses either a fingerprint, face ID, or iris ID — depending on the device — on Android or iPhone handsets, to add in a second layer of authentication. It works only if you’ve enabled biometric authentications on your device: it doesn’t if you have not.When implemented, it will appear for users before a desktop or web version can be linked up with a mobile app account, which today relies just on using a QR code. The QR code doesn’t go away; this is a second step users will need to take, similar to how you can choose to implement two steps of authentication on a handset to use the WhatsApp mobile app today.WhatsApp says that on iPhone, it will work with all devices operating iOS 14 and above with Touch ID or Face ID, while on Android, it will work on any device compatible with Biometric Authentication (Face Unlock, Fingerprint Unlock or Iris Unlock). The full instructions for how to turn it on are here.The service is another step forward in WhatsApp creating more feature parity between its flagship mobile apps and how you interact with the service when you use it elsewhere.While WhatsApp started as a mobile messaging app, it has over the years been building out other ways of using it, for example adding desktop support in 2015 to the iOS version.Mobile still accounts for the majority of WhatsApp’s users, but events like global health pandemics, which are keeping more of us inside, are likely leading to a surge of users of its Web and native desktop apps, and so it makes sense for it to be adding more functionality there.WhatsApp told TechCrunch that it is going to be adding in more features this year to bring the desktop and mobile experiences closer together. There are still big gaps. For example, you can’t make calls on the WhatsApp web version. (That feature may be one coming soon: last month, it started to get spotted in beta tests.)What comes next for biometrics?WhatsApp’s recent announcement (and walk back) regarding data-sharing changes between it and Facebook have put a lot of people on edge about the company’s intentions.And that’s no surprise. It’s a particularly sensitive issue since messaging has been thought of a very personal and sometimes private space, seen as separate from what people do on more open social networking platforms.Over the years, of course, that view has been eroded through data leaks, group messaging abuse, and (yes) changes in privacy terms.All that means there will likely be a lot of people who will doubt what Facebook’s intentions are here, too.WhatsApp is pretty clear in outlining that it’s not able to access the biometric information that you will be storing in your device, and that it is using the same standard biometric authentication APIs that other secure apps, like banking apps, use.But the banking app parallel is notable here, and maybe one worth thinking about more. Consider how the company has been adding a lot more features and functionality into WhatsApp, including the ability to pay for goods and services, and in markets like India, tests to offer insurance and pension products.Yes, this new biometric feature is being rolled out today to create a more secure way for people to link up apps across devices. But in the interest of that feature parity, in future, it will be interesting to see how and if biometrics might appear as those other features get rolled out beyond mobile, too.Update: Text corrected to reflect that the new look will be on the mobile apps (not the web) aimed at improving how to manage linked devices.']",a lot of heat,"['WhatsApp', 'NavigationClose', 'Lunden@ingridlunden / 9:17 AM', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Android', 'Android', 'iPhone', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'iPhone', 'Android', 'Biometric Authentication (Face Unlock', 'Fingerprint Unlock', 'Iris Unlock', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp’s', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Lunden9:17 AM GMT+1•January 28', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/4kCTONxGLY,2021-01-27T23:01:46,"ProtonMail, Threema, Tresorit and Tutanota warn EU lawmakers over ‘anti-encryption’ push","['Four European apps which secure user data via end-to-end encryption, ProtonMail, Threema, Tresorit and Tutanota, have issued a joint-statement warning over recent moves by EU institutions that they say are setting lawmakers on a dangerous path to backdooring encryption.End-to-end encryption refers to a form of encryption where the service provider does not hold keys to decrypt the data, thereby enhancing user privacy — as there’s no third party in the loop with the technical capability to access data in a decrypted form.E2e encryption also boosts security by reducing the attack surface area around people’s data.However growth in access to e2e encrypted services has, for some half decade or more, been flagged as an issue of concern for law enforcement. This is because it makes it harder for agencies to access decrypted data. Service providers served with a warrant for e2e encrypted user data will only be able to provide it in an unreadable form.Last month the EU Council passed a resolution on encryption that’s riven with contradiction — calling for “security through encryption and security despite encryption” — which the four e2e app makers believe is a thinly veiled call to backdoor encryption.EU Council wants secure encryption and lawful data accessThe European Commission has also talked about seeking “improved access” to encrypted information, writing in a wide-ranging counter-terrorism agenda also published in December that it will “work with Member States to identify possible legal, operational, and technical solutions for lawful access” [emphasis its].Simultaneously, the Commission has said it will “promote an approach which both maintains the effectiveness of encryption in protecting privacy and security of communications, while providing an effective response to crime and terrorism”. And it has made it clear there will be no ‘one silver bullet’ as regards the e2e encryption security ‘challenge’.But such caveats are doing nothing to alleviate the concerns of e2e encrypted app makers — who are convinced proposals from the Council of the EU, which is involved in adopting the bloc’s laws (though the Commission usually drafts legislation), sums to an push toward backdoors.“While it’s not explicitly stated in the resolution, it’s widely understood that the proposal seeks to allow law enforcement access to encrypted platforms via backdoors,” the four app makers write, going on to warn that such a move would fatally underline the security EU institutions also claim to want to maintain.“The resolution makes a fundamental misunderstanding: Encryption is an absolute, data is either encrypted or it isn’t, users have privacy or they don’t,” they go on. “The desire to give law enforcement more tools to fight crime is obviously understandable. But the proposals are the digital equivalent of giving law enforcement a key to every citizen’s home and might begin a slippery slope towards greater violations of personal privacy.”On encryption and counter-terrorism, EU lawmakers say they’ll work for ‘lawful’ data accessThey point out that any move to break e2e encryption in Europe would run counter to the global rise in interest in robustly encrypted services — pointing to the recent surge in sign-ups for apps like Signal as a result of mainstream privacy concerns attached to Facebook-owned WhatsApp.Europe has also been ahead of the curve globally in legislating to protect privacy and security. So it would be quite the U-turn for EU lawmakers to line up to poke holes in e2e encryption. (Which, for example, EU data protection regulators are simultaneously recommending be used in order to legally secure transfers of personal data out of the bloc to third countries where it might be at risk).To say there are ideological contradictions in the EU pushing in an anti-encryption direction is a massive understatement. Even as the contents of current communiques coming out of Brussels on this topic read as if they’re inherently conflicted — which may in fact be a recognition that squaring this circle is no simple policy proposition.The app makers also pick up on that. “People around the world are taking back control of their privacy, and often it’s European companies helping them do it. It seems illogical that policy makers in the EU would now push for laws that fly in the face of public opinion and undermine a growing European technology sector,” they write.What’s all this about Europe wanting crypto backdoors?In an individual quotation from the joint-statement, Andy Yen, CEO and founder of ProtonMail, a Swiss end-to-end encrypted email service, warns against complacency in the face of the latest seeming push for a legal framework to perforate encryption.“This is not the first time we’ve seen anti-encryption rhetoric emanating from some parts of Europe, and I doubt it will be the last. But that does not mean we should be complacent,” he said. “Put simply, the resolution is no different from the previous proposals which generated a wide backlash from privacy conscious companies, civil society members, experts and MEPs.“The difference this time is that the Council has taken a more subtle approach and avoided explicitly using words like ‘ban’ or ‘backdoor’. But make no mistake, this is the intention. It’s important that steps are taken now to prevent these proposals going too far and keep European’s rights to privacy intact.”Encryption under fire in Europe as France and Germany call for decrypt lawMartin Blatter, CEO of end-to-end encrypted instant messaging app Threema, also argues that EU lawmakers risk kneecapping homegrown startups if they seek to push ahead with legislation to force European vendors to bypass or deliberately weaken e2e encryption.“[It] would not only destroy the European IT startup economy, it would also fail to provide even one bit of additional security,” he warned. “Joining the ranks of the most notorious surveillance states in this world, Europe would recklessly abandon its unique competitive advantage and become a privacy wasteland.”Also chipping in, Istvan Lam, co-founder and CEO of Tresorit, an e2e encrypted file sync & sharing service, argues that any moves to weaken encryption would seriously undermine trust in services — as well as being “irreconcilable with the EU’s current stance on data privacy”.“We find this resolution especially alarming given the EU’s previously progressive views on data protection. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU’s globally recognized model for data protection legislation, explicitly advocates for strong encryption as a fundamental technology to ensure citizens’ privacy,” he said, adding: “The current and proposed approaches are at complete odds with each other, as it is impossible to guarantee the integrity of encryption while providing any kind of targeted access to the encrypted data.”While Arne Möhle, co-founder of Tutanota, a German e2e encrypted email provider, says any push to backdoor encryption would be a disaster for security — which actually risks helping criminals.“Every EU citizen needs encryption to keep their data safe on the web and to protect themselves from malicious attackers,” he said. “With the latest attempt to backdoor encryption, politicians want an easier way to prevent crimes such as terrorist attacks while disregarding an entire range of other crimes that encryption protects us from: End-to-end encryption protects our data and communication against eavesdroppers such as hackers, (foreign) governments, and terrorists.”“By demanding encryption backdoors, politicians are not asking us to choose between security and privacy. They are asking us to choose no security,” he added.German secure email provider Tutanota forced to monitor an account, after regional court rulingA fight looks to be brewing in Europe over what exactly the Council’s contradictory edict on ensuring “security through encryption and security despite encryption” will shake out to. But it seems clear that any push toward backdoors would mobilize major regional opposition — as well as being an unattractive option for EU policymakers because it would face legal challenge under the region’s jurisprudence.The Commission recognizes this complexity. Its counter-terrorism agenda is also notably wide-ranging. There’s certainly no suggestion that it believes e2e encryption is a sole nut that must be cracked. EU institutions are pushing across a number of fronts here, not least because a bunch of fundamental\xa0red lines limit wiggle room for non-targeted interventions.What comes out of the Council’s resolution may therefore be a concerted push to upskill police in areas relevant to investigations (such as digital forensics and metadata analysis). And perhaps create structures for local or state level forces across the bloc to access more powerful security service technical competences for furthering targeted investigations (e.g. device hacking). Rather than an EU-level order blasted at e2e encryption vendors to mandate a universal key escrow ‘solution’ (or similar) — indiscriminately risking everyone’s security and privacy.But it’s certainly one to watch.#SaveEncryption: EU Commission tells concerned MEPs it is not planning to ""generally weaken, directly or indirectly ban for all citizens, such as through the introduction of \'back doors\'"", #encryption. pic.twitter.com/UQp0rWjfxm— echo_pbreyer@chaos.social (@echo_pbreyer) January 28, 2021Europe’s top court confirms no mass surveillance without limits']",Last month ,"['ProtonMail', 'Tresorit', 'EU', 'NavigationClose', 'EU', 'Lomas@riptari', 'John Lund', 'Getty ImagesFour', 'ProtonMail', 'EU', 'E2e', 'EU Council', 'EU Council', 'accessThe European Commission', 'Commission', 'the Council of the EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'Signal', 'WhatsApp', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'Andy Yen', 'ProtonMail', 'Council', 'European’s', 'lawMartin Blatter', 'EU', 'Istvan Lam', 'Tresorit', 'EU', 'EU', 'The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR', 'EU', 'Arne Möhle', 'EU', 'Council’s', 'EU', 'EU', 'Council’s', 'EU', 'watch.#SaveEncryption: EU Commission', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Tresorit', 'EU', 'ProtonMail', 'EU', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/nryHxsBKVL,2021-01-28T08:00:42,Levity is a ‘no-code’ AI tool to let anyone create workflow automations,"['Levity, which has been operating in stealth (until now), is the latest no-code company to throw its wares into the ring, having picked up $1.7 million in pre-seed funding led by Gil Dibner’s Angular Ventures. The Berlin-based startup wants to bring AI-powered workflow automation to anyone, letting knowledge workers automate tedious, repetitive and manual parts of their job without the need to learn how to code.Suitable for customer service, marketing, operations, HR, and more, Levity has elected to be a horizontal offering from the get-go. Typical repetitive tasks that can be automated include reviewing and categorising documents, images, or text. The premise is that conventional, rule-based automation software isn’t able to automate tasks like these as it requires cognitive abilities, meaning that they are usually done manually. This, of course, is where machine learning come into play.“We want to solve the problem that people spend so much time at their jobs doing boring, repetitive stuff that can be automated to free up space and time for fun and interesting work,” says Gero Keil, co-founder and CEO. “Even though this is what AI has been promising us for decades, there are very few solutions out there, and even less for non-technical people who can’t code”.Blobr, the ‘no-code’ company turning APIs into products, raises €1.2M pre-seedTo that end, Keil says Levity’s entire mission is to help non-technical knowledge workers automate what they couldn’t automate before. Specifically, the startup targets work processes that involve making decisions on unstructured data, such as images, text, PDFs and other documents.“For example, if a company receives hundreds or thousands of emails from partners and customers with attachments every day, someone typically has to download the attachment, look at it and then decide what to do with it,” explains Keil. “With Levity, they can train their own custom AI on all of the historic data that they have accumulated, and once it has learned from that it seamlessly integrates with their existing tools and workflows e.g. Dropbox, Gmail, Slack etc.”More broadly, he says there are many companies struggling to “productionize AI” that would really benefit from having an end-to-end platform “that enables them to build their own AI solutions and make them part of their processes”.Keil argues that Levity’s main competitor is people doing work manually, but concedes that there is crossover with automation machine learning tools, workflow automation offerings, and labelling tools,“Instead of going deep into every domain of the ML value chain and making the lives of developers and data scientists at large corporations easier, we focus only the most essential bits and pieces, wrap them in simple and enjoyable UX and abstract the rest away,” he says. “That makes us the best for non-developers in small and medium-sized businesses that want to automate previously non automatable processes in the most straightforward way. The people that have the automation problem become the same people that solve the automation problem; it’s a paradigm shift just like what Wix and Squarespace did to websites”.Adds Gil Dibner, general partner and founder at Angular Ventures, in a statement: “Levity is driving a massive shift that will affect all knowledge workers. By allowing knowledge workers to easily train AI engines, build AI-powered automations, and integrate them into their everyday workflows, Levity is radically democratizing the benefits of AI.”Alongside Angular, Levity’s other backers include: System.One, Discovery Ventures (founders of SumUp), Martin Henk (founder of Pipedrive) and various additional unnamed angel investors.Angular Ventures outs $41M seed fund for European and Israeli enterprise and ‘deep tech’ startups']",Levity,"['NavigationClose', 'Gil Dibner’s', 'Angular Ventures', 'AI', 'Levity', 'Gero Keil', 'AI', 'Blobr', 'Keil', 'Levity’s', 'Levity', 'AI', 'Dropbox', 'Gmail', 'Slack', 'AI', 'AI', 'Keil', 'Levity’s', 'ML', 'Gil Dibner', 'Angular Ventures', 'AI', 'AI', 'Levity', 'Angular', 'Levity', 'Discovery Ventures', 'SumUp', 'Martin Henk', 'Angular Ventures', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropeFundings & ExitsStartupsTCAngular Venturesartificial', 'Gil Dibner’s', 'Angula', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/zdkyuYRkq4,2021-01-27T16:14:48,How 2 startups scaled to $50M ARR and beyond,"['The current list of venture-backed private companies we expect to go public — and the number of companies that might say yes to a SPAC-led debut — underscore just how many large startups there are in the market.After years of rising venture capital investment\xa0and a wave of huge rounds, many startups and unicorns could leave the private markets this year or the next.Last year, The Exchange wrote about former startups that had scaled to around the $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) mark, or had revenues that were roughly equivalent if they didn’t sell software. But that wound up being a bit less interesting than we’d hoped, as companies that have reached that scale tend to be fully baked by the time we got them on the phone.So, we’re shooting for the $50 million ARR range this year. Our goal is to see what we can ferret out from companies that are moving from the middle-late startup years and into the unicorn realm.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.What broke during the last year? Which teams have they doubled down on? How has hiring gone? We have questions. And, happily, companies have raised their hand. Today, we’re talking about OwnBackup and Assembly. Next week, it’s SimpleNexus and Kaseya. And we have Picsart on deck as a company somewhat in between our two target revenue bands.But before we start, a final note. The following bits of journalism are more exploratory than hard-hitting. But as private companies tend to share nothing other than the occasional press release strained of personality and flavor, I’m working to bring more raw data points and observations to you even if they do not constitute the grittiest reporting you’ve ever read.Let’s get into our first two $50 million (or around there) ARR companies.OwnBackupOwnBackup is a company you might have heard of as it raised a $50 million round last July, an event TechCrunch covered. The company reached out regarding our $50 million ARR series by noting that its growth had accelerated since that round, so we decided to find out more.The Exchange spoke with CEO Sam Gutmann and CMO Jamie Grenney about OwnBackup’s recent growth.According to the execs, OwnBackup is around $50 million ARR today. The company, as its name hints, provides cloud backup services to other companies. And it’s built atop the Salesforce platform, a service that had a good 2020 when nCino, another company that leverages the service, went public to great effect. (That debut led to TechCrunch reporting on the trend of building atop someone else’s software to IPO scale.)And OwnBackup has lots of room to grow inside of its current platform home. It thinks it has around 2% penetration of the Salesforce ecosystem, meaning that its current 100% yearly growth pace can continue for quite some time without a material change in strategy.Asked if OwnBackup was worried about platform risk, Gutmann and Grenney said they weren’t. Not only is Salesforce Ventures an investor, the execs noted, but the Salesforce platform is a huge SaaS ecosystem; it’s not something that could be switched off like a Google web product and consigned to the ash heap of the internet.']",rising venture capital investment,"['Nigel Sussman', 'Exchange', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'Exchange', 'Exchange', 'OwnBackup', 'Assembly', 'SimpleNexus', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'Exchange', 'Sam Gutmann', 'Jamie Grenney', 'OwnBackup’s', 'OwnBackup', 'ARR', 'Salesforce', 'OwnBackup', 'Salesforce', 'OwnBackup', 'Gutmann and Grenney', 'Salesforce Ventures', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'OwnBackup', 'Assembly', 'Alex Wilhelm5:14 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/RA9V9mJWzD,2021-01-28T05:00:35,Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature will be enabled by default and arrive in ‘early spring’ on iOS,"['Apple has shared a few more details about its much-discussed privacy changes in iOS 14. The company first announced at WWDC in June that app developers would have to ask users for permission in order to track and share their IDFA identifier for cross-property ad targeting purposes. While iOS 14 launched in the fall, Apple delayed the tracking restrictions until 2021, saying it wanted to give developers more time to make the necessary changes.Now we’ve got a slightly-more-specific timeline. The plan is to launch these changes in early spring, with a version of the feature coming in the next iOS 14 beta release.This is how Apple describes the new system: “Under Settings, users will be able to see which apps have requested permission to track, and make changes as they see fit. This requirement will roll out broadly in early spring with an upcoming release of iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and tvOS 14, and has already garnered support from privacy advocates around the world.”And here are the basics of what you need to know:The App Tracking Transparency feature moves from the old method where you had to opt-out of sharing your Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) to an opt-in model. This means that every app will have to ask you up front whether it is ok for them to share your IDFA with third parties including networks or data brokers.The feature’s most prominent evidence is a notification on launch of a new app that will explain what the tracker will be used for and ask you to opt-in to it.You can now toggle IDFA sharing on a by-app basis at any time, where previously it was a single toggle. If you turn off the “Allow apps to request to track” setting altogether no apps can even ask you to use tracking.Apple will enforce this for all third-party data sources including data sharing agreements, but of course platforms can still use first party data for advertising as per their terms of service.Apple expects developers to understand whether APIs or SDKs that they use in their apps are serving user data up to brokers or other networks and to enable the notification if so.Apple will abide by the rules for its own apps as well and will present the dialog and follow the ‘allow apps to request’ toggle if its apps use tracking (most do not at this point).One important note here is that the Personalized Ads toggle is a separate setting that specifically allows or does not allow Apple itself to use its own first party data to serve you ads. So that is an additional layer of opt-out that affects Apple data only.Apple is also increasing the capabilities of its Ad attribution API, allowing for better click measurement, measurement of video conversions and also — and this is a big one for some cases, app-to-web conversions.This news comes on Data Privacy Day, with CEO Tim Cook speaking on the issue this morning at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. The company is also sharing a new report showing that the average app has six third-party trackers.While this seems like a welcome change from a privacy perspective, it’s drawn some criticism from the ad industry, with Facebook launching a PR campaign emphasizing the impact on small businesses, while also pointing to the change as “one of the more significant advertising headwinds” that it could face this year. Apple’s stance is that this provides a user-centric data privacy approach, rather than an advertiser-centric one.Apple takes aim at adtech hysteria over iOS app tracking change\xa0']",announced at WWDC in June,"['Apple', 'Matthew Panzarino', 'Apple', 'IDFA', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'The App Tracking Transparency', 'IDFA', 'IDFA', 'IDFA', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Data Privacy Day', 'Tim Cook', 'the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection', 'Apple’s', 'Apple', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Matthew Panzarino6:00 AM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/EIZl2wRcBH,2021-01-28T00:50:52,"Elon Musk says Tesla Semi is ready for production, but limited by battery cell output","['Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on the company’s 2020 Q4 earnings call that all engineering work is now complete on the Tesla Semi, the freight-hauling semi truck that the company is building with an all-electric powertrain. The company expects to begin deliveries of Tesla Semi this year, it said in its Q4 earnings release, and Musk said the only thing limiting their ability to produce them now is the availability of battery cells.“The main reason we have not accelerated new products – like for example Tesla Semi – is that we simply don’t have enough cells for it,” Musk said. “If we were to make the Semi right now, and we could easily go into production with the Semi right now, but we would not have enough cells for it.”Musk added that the company does expect to have sufficient cell volume to meet its needs once it goes into production on its 4680 battery pack, which is a new custom cell design it created with a so-called ‘tables’ design that allows for greater energy density and, therefore, range.Future Teslas will have batteries that double as structure, making them extra stiff while improving efficiency, safety and cost“A Semi would use typically five times the number of cells that a car would use, but it would not sell for five times what a car would sell for, so it kind of would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now,” Musk said. “But it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint.”That constraint points to the same conclusion for the possibility of Tesla developing a van, Musk added, and the lifting of the constraint will likewise make it possible for Tesla to pursue the development of that category of vehicle, he said.Tesla has big plans for “exponentially” ramping cell production, with a goal of having production capacity infrastructure in place for a Toal of 200 gigawatt hours per year by 2022, and a target of being able to actually produce around 40% of that by that year (with future process improvements generating additional gigawatt hours of cell capacity \xa0in gradual improvements thereafter).\xa0']","Future Teslas will have batteries that double as structure, making them extra stiff while improving efficiency, safety and cost","['Elon Musk', 'Tesla Semi', 'NavigationClose', 'Musk', 'Tesla Semi', 'Etherington@etherington', 'CommentTesla', 'Elon Musk', 'Musk', 'Tesla Semi', 'Musk', 'Teslas', 'Musk', 'Musk', 'Tesla', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAutomotiveTCTransportationcarsceoElon', 'Model STesla Model YTesla', 'Musk', 'Tesla Semi', 'Etherington1:50 AM', 'Elon Musk', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/r8Fp0OPIDw,2021-01-28T00:21:47,Tesla is willing to license Autopilot and has already had ‘preliminary discussions’ about it with other automakers,"['Tesla is open to licensing its software, including its Autopilot highly-automated driving technology and the neural network training it has built to improve its autonomous driving technology. Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed those considerations on the company’s Q4 earnings call on Wednesday, adding that the company has in fact already “had some preliminary discussions about licensing Autopilot to other OEMs.”The company began rolling out its beta version of the so-called ‘full self-driving’ or FSD version of Autopilot late last year. The standard Autopilot features available in general release provide advanced driver assistance (ADAS) which provide essentially advanced cruise control capabilities designed primarily for use in highway commutes. Musk said on the call that he expects the company will seek to prove out its FSD capabilities before entering into any licensing agreements, if it does end up pursuing that path.Musk noted that Tesla’s “philosophy is definitely not to create walled gardens” overall, and pointed out that the company is planning to allow other automakers to use its Supercharger networks, as well as its autonomy software. He characterized Tesla as “more than happy to license” those autonomous technologies to “other car companies,” in fact.One key technical hurdle required to get to a point where Tesla’s technology is able to demonstrate true reliability far surpassing that of a standard human driver is transition the neural networks operating in the cars and providing them with the analysis that powers their perception engines is to transition those to video. That’s a full-stack transition across the system away from basing it around neural nets trained on single cameras and single frames.To this end, the company has developed video-labelling software that has had “a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling,” with the ultimate aim being enabling automatic labeling. Musk (who isn’t known for modesty around his company’s achievements, it should be said) noted that Tesla believes “it may be the best neural net training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude,” adding that it’s also “something we can offer potentially as a service.”Training huge quantities of video data will help Tesla push the reliability of its software from 100% that of a human driver, to 200% and eventually to “2,000% better than the average human,” Musk said, while again suggesting that it won’t be a technological achievement the company is interested into keeping to themselves.\xa0']",with a post from moderator u/zjz,"['Autopilot', 'NavigationClose', 'Autopilot', 'Etherington@etherington', 'Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg / Getty ImagesTesla', 'Autopilot', 'Elon Musk', 'Autopilot', 'FSD', 'Autopilot', 'Autopilot', 'ADAS', 'Musk', 'FSD', 'Musk', 'Tesla’s', 'Musk', 'Tesla', 'Musk', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'carTeslaTesla AutopilotTesla', 'Autopilot', 'Etherington1:21 AM', 'Autopilot', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

It does not appear as though Reddit took direct action against the community, but instead that r/wallstreetbets moderators were overwhelmed by the influx of new users and have taken the subreddit down themselves.

As the company said in its presentation to shareholders, “[energy] deployments grew substantially from 2019 to 2020. For the first time, our total battery deployments surpassed 3 GWh in a single year, which is an 83% increase compared to the prior year.Solar deployments also had their day in the sun. For the year, solar energy installations increased to 205 MW, an 18% increase over the prior year. “This growth is the result of meaningful improvements to our solar retrofit strategy, including product simplification, cost reduction and industry-leading pricing.Revenue from the energy generation and storage business came in at $752 million for the fourth quarter, up from $436 million in the year-ago period, and up $579 million from the third quarter.This is likely only the beginning of the surge that’s coming for Tesla’s power business. The company has long stated that it wants to be one of the world’s largest power or utility companies, and global capital is marshaling resources to encourage the shift to renewables.Tesla could be a huge beneficiary from the Biden administration’s renewable plans through their goals to dramatically boost solar development and buildings. The big infrastructure spend will require big batteries to store renewable power. It will also require massive solar installations.A Biden presidency doesn’t need a Green New Deal to make progress on climate changeAnd even as the federal government makes money moves to renewables, private capital is coming in to boost solar installations and energy storage dramatically.Over the last week alone, investors have pumped nearly $2 billion into companies that lend money to homeowners for solar installations and energy efficiency upgrades. One company, founded by a former SolarCity executive, announced that it had raised $800 million in capital just today.At least some of that money will have cash registers ringing for Tesla’s energy storage and solar installation business.Renewable investment wave continues as solar lending company Loanpal raises $800 million\xa0']",apparently driven by users in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit,"['NavigationClose', 'Patrick T.

https://t.co/9QkMIS64Tu,2021-01-27T22:22:09,IAC’s Teltech acquired encrypted mobile messaging app Confide,"['IAC has acquired Confide, the encrypted mobile messaging that once made headlines for its use by White House staffers during the Trump administration. The deal, which closed on Dec. 1, 2020 but was not publicly announced, sees Confide joining Teltech, the makers of spam call-busting app Robokiller, which itself had joined IAC’s Mosaic Group by way of a 2018 acquisition.Teltech confirmed the Confide acquisition, but declined to share the deal terms. The confidential mobile messaging app had raised just $3.5 million in funding, according to Crunchbase data, and had been valued between $10 to $50 million, as a result. (Pitchbook put the valuation at ~$14 million around the same time.)According to Teltech, the deal was for the Confide IP and technology, but not the team.The company believes Confide makes for a good fit among its growing group of mobile communication apps, including Robokiller and its latest app, SwitchUp, which offers users a second phone number for additional privacy and spam blocking purposes. Other Teletech apps include phone call recorder TapeACall and blocked call unmasker TrapCall.Confide, however, may end up being one of the better-known additions among that group, thanks to being remembered as a favored tool of choice among frustrated Washington Republicans during the Trump years.But despite the user growth that news had driven, things slowed in the months that followed, when\xa0researchers published a report that claimed Confide wasn’t as secure as it had promised. Confide quickly fixed its vulnerabilities but then a month later was facing a class action lawsuit\xa0(later dismissed by the plaintiff) over the security issues.Teltech says it was aware of the security concerns, but it had conversations with the prior Confide team and understands that the earlier issues had been “quickly and effectively remediated.”While IAC won’t speak to its specific plans for Confide’s future, the app will continue to offer users a safe and secure way to communicate. What it won’t do, though, is try to directly compete with Telegram or other private apps that offer large channels or group chats that support tens of thousands of people at once.“I think one kind of key differentiators is that Confide is definitely more for one-on-one and smaller group communication, rather than with Signal and Telegram where there’s some larger chat dynamics,” notes Giulia Porter, Teltech’s VP of Marketing. “One thing that makes us a little bit different is just that we’re more personal,” she says.Despite having hit some bumps in the road over the years, Confide as of the time of the acquisition, still had around 100,000 monthly active users. There’s now a team of around 10 assigned to work on the app, adding needed resources to its further development, and soon, an updated logo and branding.Confide’s existing desktop and mobile apps will also continue to be available, but later updated with new features as part of Teltech’s efforts.Investors and IAC alike have declined to talk about deal price, but that may speak for itself.“With the absolute explosion in privacy over the past several years, Confide, which started as a side project, has become a mission-critical platform for sensitive communication throughout the world,” said Confide co-founder and President Jon Brod, in a statement shared with TechCrunch about Confide’s exit.“We’re thrilled that IAC shares our passion for secure communication and recognizes the unique business we have built. IAC has a proven track record of providing fast-growing companies with the support to reach their full potential and we are excited to see IAC take Confide to the next level,” he said.']",Apple just had its best quarter in India,"['IAC', 'Teltech', 'NavigationClose ScreenIAC’s', 'Teltech', 'ConfideSarah Perez@sarahintampa', 'White House', 'Trump', 'Teltech', 'Robokiller', 'IAC’s Mosaic Group', 'Teltech', 'Crunchbase', 'Teltech', 'Robokiller', 'SwitchUp', 'Teletech', 'Teltech', 'IAC', 'Confide’s', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'Giulia Porter', 'Teltech’s VP of Marketing', 'Confide’s', 'Teltech’s', 'IAC', 'Jon Brod', 'Confide’s', 'IAC', 'IAC', 'IAC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAppsExitM&AMobilechatConfideIACjon', 'Teltech', 'ConfideSarah', 'White House', 'Trump', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Those deals were worth a combined $78.5 million, according to Crunchbase data.But Squarespace is perhaps best known for its epic 2017-era $200 million secondary round that General Atlantic financed. A secondary round is a transaction in which an external party buys share from existing shareholders, instead of the company issuing new equity. Some private companies execute secondary transactions when they do not need additional capital, but are also not near a liquidity event.The 2017 transaction fits well with the company’s now-impending 2021 IPO.At the time TechCrunch reported that the company had revenues of around $300 million and that it was profitable.By filing, Squarespace joins a growing list of companies pursuing the public markets in recent months. At the end of 2020 C3.ai, DoorDash and Airbnb listed. To kick off 2021, Affirm and Poshmark listed to great effect. Coinbase has filed, Robinhood is a hot IPO prospect, and now Squarespace is throwing its hat into the ring.The Squarespace filing is private, which means that we are waiting for a future public S-1 from the company.

https://t.co/o9T0UuCTLA,2021-01-27T22:09:49,Investors don’t seem that impressed by Apple’s $111 billion quarter,"['On Wednesday, Apple announces that it had banked $111.4 billion of revenue in a single quarter, beating investor expectations and blowing past its previous all-time revenue record. Investors yawned with the stock down slightly in after-hours trading following the report’s release.It’s a big number but it also bested analyst’s forecasts for Apple’s first quarter. Apple beat investor expectations on both earnings per share and revenues, delivering much more than the expected $103.3 billion in revenues and $1.68 EPS versus the $1.41 the Street had expected.As meme stocks like GameStop and AMC see 100%+ stock gains, it’s a sober reminder that for the rest of the broader public market it’s business as usual and investors have big expectations for massive tech stocks that have seen their market caps and stock prices reach new heights in recent months. Despite the lack of a shock adjustment from the earnings report release this afternoon, Apple’s share price has risen more than 23% since it released its last earnings report in late October.Apple’s revenue gains from Q1 represented 20 percent year-over-year revenue growth, but a big chunk of that growth came from a single region: China. Quarterly revenues in the region were up nearly 57% eclipsing $21.3 billion compared to $13.6 billion in the same quarter last year.In terms of revenues via product vertical, iPhone of course reigned supreme with $65.6 billion in sales compared to $56 billion in sales during the same quarter last year. Due to a later-than-usual release timeline for Apple’s latest iPhones, this quarter encapsulates a more substantial swath of the early sales for the device.It wasn’t just a big quarter for iPhone, iPad sales growth exceeded that of Mac, nearly pushing the category above the other with $8.7 billion in Mac sales and $8.4 billion in iPad sales.

https://t.co/ODaO4gQnZj,2021-01-27T21:49:16,Facebook predicts ‘significant’ obstacles to ad targeting and revenue in 2021,"['While Facebook’s fourth quarter earnings report included solid user and revenue numbers, the company sounded a note of caution for 2021.In the “CFO outlook” section of the earnings release, Facebook said it anticipates facing “more significant advertising headwinds” this year.“This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS 14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape,” the company wrote. “While the timing of the iOS 14 changes remains uncertain, we would expect to see an impact beginning late in the first quarter.”Facebook has already been waging a bit of a campaign against Apple’s upcoming privacy changes, which will require app developers to ask users for permission in order to use their IDFA identifiers for ad targeting — although the PR focus has been the impact on small businesses, not Facebook.Facebook also highlighted two broad economic trends that it says it has benefited from during the pandemic: The “ongoing shift toward online commerce” and “the shift in consumer demand toward products and away from services.” But again, it took a cautious stance, writing that “a moderation or reversal in one or both of these trends could serve as a headwind to our advertising revenue growth.”As for those fourth quarter earnings earnings, Facebook reported $28.1 billion in revenue, of which $27.2 billion came from ads, with earnings per share of $3.88. Wall Street analysts had predicted EPS of $3.22 and revenue of $26.4 billon.Facebook also reported an average of 1.84 billion daily active users and 2.8 billion monthly active users for the quarter, up 11% and 12% year over year, respectively.“We had a strong end to the year as people and businesses continued to use our services during these challenging times,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. “I’m excited about our product roadmap for 2021 as we build new and meaningful ways to create economic opportunity, build community and help people just have fun.”As of 4:45 p.m. EST, Facebook shares were up 0.7% in after-hours trading.Facebook highlights small businesses as it ramps up Apple criticism']",as Reuters put it,"['NavigationClose ScreenFacebook', 'Apple’s', 'IDFA', 'EPS', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'Apple', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/mKWJbZyv3W,2021-01-27T21:17:42,How trading apps are responding to the GameStop fustercluck,"['The furor surrounding GameStop and its stock price has consumed social media, business television, and the hopes and dreams of many retail investors. It has even convinced some folks that causing short-term economic damage to a few hedge funds is similar to shaking up the global financial market.It isn’t, but a lot of folks are doing some downright risky things with their personal capital all the same. And some of them are making those investments — bets, let’s be honest — on platforms that have lowered barriers to buying and selling stocks by cutting trading fees to zero. Apps and services like Robinhood, Public, M1 Finance and Freetrade.GameStop, meme stocks, and the revenge of the retail traderAfter noting reports that some traditional brokers were limiting access to GameStop and other so-called meme stocks, TechCrunch was curious what the newer, app-based investing services were doing for their own users.A spokesperson for M1 Finance, a Midwest-based consumer fintech player that offers a basket of banking and investing services — more on its growth here and here — told TechCrunch via email that it wasn’t taking “specific” steps regarding individual stocks.But the company also provided a statement from its CEO, Brian Barnes. In his comment, Barnes drew a delineation between investing, and trading, which he likened to a casino, adding that his firm “question[s] whether short-term trading is predictable, sustainable or repeatable.”M1 Finance closes $45M Series C mere months after it raised its $33M Series BIt isn’t for nearly anyone, of course. Barnes went on to say that his company thinks that “ownership of great companies and assets at reasonable prices that compound for long periods of time is the most straightforward and repeatable way to build wealth,” and that they have focused their company more around that ethos, “forego[ing] the mania of the moment.”Turning to the well-known Robinhood, an impressive 2020 growth story, TechCrunch asked the same question regarding warnings or other guardrails for users concerning certain equities.In an email a Robinhood spokesperson directed TechCrunch to a comment that its CEO, Vlad Tenev, made on CNBC earlier today:Like other brokerages do, we monitor volatility and we take steps as appropriate like raising the margin requirements. I do think it’s wrong to assume though that most of our activity is characterized by trading of volatile stocks. As I’ve said before, most of our customers are what’s called buy and hold. They deposit and buy over the long term.Robinhood changed margin requirements for GameStop and AMC Entertainment to 100%, TechCrunch understands. And like M1, Robinhood doesn’t allow users to short equities. So, there’s that.Something notable about the companies we are discussing is that not one of them wants to be labeled as the place where folks like to trade a lot. Which amuses me as cutting fees to zero, which they have largely done, is at once a great way to democratize investing, and, also, a great way to encourage folks to trade more frequently. And as the apps and services that offer free trading often make money when users trade (read this), their chatter about their users being focused on buying and holding always rings slightly thin.Social stock trading services Public raises $65M Series CAnyhoo, some apps are going as far as adding warnings. Public, a company that TechCrunch recently covered, said that the company has added “‘High Risk’ safety labels” to the meme stocks that are causing so much ruckus.Public has long had a stated focus on building community over trading, which led to us having a question or two about when it is going to kickstart its monetization plans. The company did just hire a CFO, which makes this move appear in concert with its general ethos, so more to come there we presume.And, finally, U.K.-based Freetrade. TechCrunch has covered the service before, making it a good company to rope into this group. Per the company, Freetrade restricts small-cap stocks to the subscription tier of its service, which should limit access amongst its user base to GameStop and other memetic equities.The company also stressed that it does not offer options or “any other form of leveraged derivatives” and has made “huge investment in investor education and financial literacy.”Fintech’s savings and investing boom isn’t just a domestic affairSo there’s a general bent toward either building products that are not tuned for day trading in silly stocks or providing some protection against users’ worst instincts amongst the cohort of companies that have also made it inexpensive to trade. There’s tension there, akin to this.But they can only do so much. People are dumb, and it’s not looking like that’s going to get much better anytime soon.']",Share on Twitter ,"['NavigationClose', 'Wilhelm@alex /', 'GameStop', 'Robinhood, Public', 'M1 Finance', 'Freetrade', 'GameStop', 'M1 Finance', 'Brian Barnes', '”M1 Finance', 'Vlad Tenev', 'CNBC', 'GameStop', 'AMC Entertainment', 'Public', 'CFO', 'Freetrade', 'GameStop', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCfreetradeM1', 'GameStop', 'GameStop', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The firm’s best-known product to date is almost certainly Pepper, a humanoid robot designed for greeting and signage that grew out of it 2015 acquisition of French robotics company Aldebaran.There’s also the matter of the investment firm’s acquisition and eventual sale of Boston Dynamics. The deal certainly went a ways toward accelerating the company’s go-to-market approach, but Boston Dynamics changed hands fairly quickly, when it was sold to Hyundai late last year (SoftBank maintains 20%).The latest wrinkle in SoftBank’s robotic ambitions is nothing if not interesting. The firm announced today that it is joining forces with Iris Ohyama. The Japanese brand, which will hold a 51% stake in the venture (with SoftBank controlling the remainder), is best known for its home goods. The company makes a broad range of products, that includes, as Reuters put it, “everything from rice to rice cookers.”You’ll be able to add robotics to that list, soon enough. The newly formed Iris Robotics has set an extremely aggressive goal of $965 million in sales by 2025. In a joint press release, the company noted COVID-19-related concerns as a major catalyst in the launch of the division. Certainly that makes strategic sense. There’s little question that the past year has kickstarted serious interest in robotics and automation.The first couple of products from the venture don’t appear especially ambitious out of the gate, however. To start, it seems they’ll be rolling out “Iris Editions” of a pair of existing devices: Bear Robotics’ restaurant robot Servi and cleaning robot Whiz.Here’s a quote from SoftBank Robotics CEO (forgive the Google translate):With the urgent need to realize the new normal in the coronavirus, various new expectations are being placed on robots. This strong partnership with Iris Ohyama is a huge step forward for the expansion and penetration of robot solutions. Taking full advantage of the strengths of both companies, we will respond quickly to the challenges facing society.Certainly the technical ambitions seem more modest than what the folks at companies like Boston Dynamics are currently working on, but Iris Ohyama seems well-positioned to make some headway in the home robotics category to start.Following Hyundai acquisition, Boston Dynamics’ CEO discusses the robotics pioneer’s future\xa0']",have been ,"['Iris Ohyama', 'NavigationClose', 'Iris Ohyama', 'SoftBank', 'SoftBank', 'Pepper', 'Boston Dynamics', 'Boston Dynamics', 'Hyundai', 'SoftBank', 'SoftBank’s', 'Iris Ohyama', 'SoftBank', 'Reuters', 'Iris Robotics', 'Servi', 'SoftBank', 'Iris Ohyama', 'Boston Dynamics', 'Iris Ohyama', 'Hyundai', 'Boston Dynamics’', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Iris Ohyama', 'SoftBank', 'Pepper', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/rDm2NfxNWa,2021-01-27T21:00:11,VC investment in proptech can yield profits and change lives,"['D. Hara PerkinsContributorShare on Twitter D. Hara Perkins is a partner at Goulston & Storrs, PC in New York City, where she focuses her practice on affordable housing and economic development.\tAlexander ShermansongContributorShare on Twitter Alexander Shermansong is CEO of Civic Consulting USA and an adjunct assistant professor of public service at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.\tIn 2020, nearly $24 billion in venture capital poured into companies creating new technology products or innovative business models for the real estate market.While things like smart home apps and digital mortgage financing services make life easier for upmarket renters and homeowners, none of these technologies help improve the day-to-day struggles of the vast majority of low-income families.Many of these emergent technologies could be adapted to become “housing tech” solutions — focused on financial resilience, fresh food access, healthcare access and workforce development — which have the potential to transform the lives of our most at-risk populations. \n\t\t\tYou can make money while serving the public good.\t\t\t\t\tConsider this: Nearly eight million Americans have slipped into poverty since May, according to a study released by Columbia University. Before the COVID-19 crisis hit, approximately half of all American households struggled to pay rent; a problem that is growing larger by the day as pandemic job losses continue to mount.About 23.5 million people — half of whom are low income — live in food deserts where access to affordable, healthy food is limited or nonexistent. And good health care is almost impossible to access, let alone pay for, if you are poor.As the global crisis continues to lay bare the deep inequities in our society, it’s clear that we need new ways of thinking to address these systemic issues. Investment in technology innovation in the affordable housing area could help solve these problems.Local governments and nonprofits are doing what they can. In 2015, New York launched Urbantech NYC to uncover new technology solutions to urbanization problems faced by government, businesses and urban residents, tackling issues related to food, water, medicine, waste management and other problems.In 2019, Enterprise Community Partners, a national nonprofit, partnered with MetaProp, a leading proptech venture capital firm, to invest in housing tech companies that are developing technology innovations to help families find an affordable place to live.These efforts are commendable, but it is not enough. The housing tech movement needs more champions.First, we need a more patient venture capital source, with a better understanding of underserved communities. Most venture capital firms fund what they know, and unfortunately few understand the affordable housing community, which is largely minority with female heads of household. But pay attention: There are lucrative opportunities here.Affordable housing property managers tend to invest far more in social services for their tenant population than market rate property managers considering the coolest new piece of technology. You can make money while serving the public good.Second, housing tech is in desperate need of an accelerator. The tech is out there, but most entrepreneurs don’t know how to “sell” to this specific customer base, which they must do if they want to create viable businesses that will attract venture capital. There are numerous existing technologies ready for an accelerator to take to the next level. These are a few of our favorites:Financial Resilience. Low-income people who live in affordable housing are often burdened with confiscatory payday loans and check-cashing services. Many don’t have banking relationships and pay rent in cash. The Lifesaver app helps households, especially those without banking relationships, navigate financial services and become more financially resilient. Earnin allows people to access their pay, with no fees, as soon as they work the hours without waiting for the payday to arrive. Research shows that people who take these short-term loans from nonpredatory lenders actually find themselves more financially stable in following months.Fresh Food Access. Cheetah, a wholesale grocery delivery app, has placed community fridges as fresh-food pantries. Via, a transit-on-demand provider, partnered with LA Metro and First 5 LA to subsidize food delivery during the pandemic, especially to women-led households with little children.Healthcare Access. Roundtrip provides booking for affordable nonemergency hailed rides, wheelchair vans and other specialized medical transports. Healthify offers a database of vetted and curated community resources, as well as information about the social determinants of health. Emerging software apps that facilitate telemedicine could also expand access to necessary health care.Workforce Development. Skilling America is a new workforce platform from Goodwill that improves placement, retention and promotion rates, and most people using the platform are doing so on their smartphones.An accelerator could also connect housing tech to affordable housing owners and property managers looking for ways to magnify the impact of the social services available on site. The top 50 owners of affordable housing developments have the reach to connect tech developers with almost a million households.These owners and property managers could act as leadership ambassadors of collaborative efforts among tech developers, venture capital investors and potential housing tech users.We work every day with the inspiring stakeholders in the affordable housing community, as well as local governments and tech entrepreneurs looking to bridge this digital divide. This isn’t a pie- in-the-sky vision. The future is here and the call to action is now.Twentyeight Health partners with Healthify to expand its reproductive and sexual health services']",$GME,"['NavigationClose', 'Alexander Shermansong / 10:00 PM', 'Goulston & Storrs', 'Alexander', 'Twitter Alexander Shermansong', 'Civic Consulting USA', 'New York University’s', 'Robert F.

The companies did not reveal the purchase price, but Bloomberg reported earlier this week that the deal could be worth $1.2 billion.With Signavio SAP gets a cloud-native business process management tool. SAP CFO Luka Mucic sees a world where understanding and automating businesses processes has become a key part of a company’s digital transformation efforts.“I cannot overstress the importance for companies to be able to design, benchmark, improve and transform business processes across the enterprise to support new capabilities and business models,” he said in a statement.While traditional enterprise BPA tools have existed for years, having a cloud-native tool gives SAP a much more modern approach to attacking this problem, and being able to automate business processes via the cloud has become more important during the pandemic when many employees are working entirely from home.SAP also sees Signavio as a key missing piece in the company’s business process intelligence unit. “The combination of business process intelligence from SAP and Signavio creates a leading end-to-end business process transformation suite to help our customers achieve the requirements needed to gain a competitive edge,” he said.SAP has been making moves into process automation of late. In fact at SAP TechEd in December, the company announced SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation, its foray into the RPA space. This should fit in nicely alongside it.SAP latest enterprise software giant to offer low-code workflowDr. Gero Decker, Savigno co-founder and CEO, sees SAP resources helping push the company beyond what it could have done on its own. “Considering the positioning of SAP, its geographical coverage and financial muscle, SAP is the biggest and best platform to bring process intelligence to every organization,” he said in a statement.The increased resources and reach argument is one that just about every acquired company CEO makes, but being pulled into a company the size of SAP can be a double-edged sword. Yes, it has vast resources, but it also can be hard for an acquired company to find its place in such a large pond. How well they fit in and make that transition from startup to big company cog, will go a long way in determining the success of this transaction in the long run.Signavio launched in 2009 in Berlin and has raised almost $230 million, according to Crunchbase data. Investors include Apax Digital and Summit Partners. The most recent investment was a July 2019 Series C for $177 million, which came in at a $400 million valuation.Customers include Comcast, Bosch, Liberty Mutual and yes SAP.

https://t.co/QRiD12pxBd,2021-01-27T19:24:32,Could meme stocks like GameStop kill Bitcoin’s rise?,"['Cryptocurrencies, more so than most other things, are only valuable because of a shared agreement that they are valuable. Their value is a product of digital handshakes over millions of transactions firming up that consensus. For bitcoin, the trust that it has worth has turned more valuable in the past several months; it’s been on a tear.The (very bizarre) question is whether a new avenue of applying\xa0blind trust by brigading trashcan-level stocks and turning them into memes could threaten the appeal of cryptocurrencies for retail investors.Over the past several days, we’ve seen stocks ranging from GameStop, Blockbuster and AMC make unjustifiable gains as a result of Reddit users in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit triggering a stampede toward stocks being heavily shorted by institutional investors. That in turn has led to a short squeeze troubling hedge funds, causing the price of a stock worth around $5 for the majority of 2020 to swell well above $300 today. In some ways it’s just an Occupy Wall Street protest being held on Robinhood; in other ways it’s a complete rejection of the hypothesis of efficient markets and a reinvention of institutional trust.I think it\'s time we finally classify GameStop stock as a Cryptocurrency $GME pic.twitter.com/IpiYXlmuZW— S.F (@SSSulaa) January 25, 2021Bitcoin holds fundamental differences from publicly traded stocks, many of which might matter an awful lot to those betting on the coin as a currency of the future. But to retail investors who aren’t hardcore proponents, I’d imagine FOMO was one of the most intriguing pulls into the cryptocurrency space. But if Bitcoin’s purpose for the time being is merely a “store of value,” I think there’s a world where individual investors might be evolving their interests elsewhere.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies haven’t seen notable price movement in recent days\xa0 — Bitcoin is down around 6% in the past 24 hours, a hiccup as far as crypto moves go — but after a few weeks hovering well above $30,000 and peeking above $40,000, the currency seems poised to dip below the $30,000 range soon unless its trend reverses course.All that said, Bitcoin is certainly an entity of a different scale than all of these meme stocks bundled together with a market cap above $560 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $56 billion. Bitcoin has seen stratospheric growth over the past few months so barring an outsized crash, it’s perhaps unlikely that retail investors are going to fully abandon it in favor of buying up crusty old shares of Blockbuster stock. That said …It’s cheaper to trade these meme stocks and easier for retail investors to get leverage via options. In short, for investors looking to have a good time or shoot the moon, meme stocks are a more fun place to be than crypto is.If you don\'t like suits, buy $GME and $AMC. If you don\'t like the bankers, buy #Bitcoin— Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) January 27, 2021\xa0The main thing to consider is what happens if GameStop, for no reason at all, becomes a long-term store of value? When investors collectively begin placing blind trust in more financial assets for the long haul, does that devalue blind trust itself and the mammoth entities that had more of a monopoly on it? Most investors aren’t expecting this to happen, but stocks like Tesla are beginning to live comfortably at ridiculous premiums that analysts can’t understand. Tesla and GameStop are very different beasts, but if anything I think institutions have a better grasp of GameStop’s rise.The foil to all of this is whether this pandemonium births some regulatory backlash, a possibility that of course does not exist in quite the same way for cryptocurrencies from a central governance standpoint. TD Ameritrade and Schwab are already limiting trades of some of these meme stocks today and I think there is certainly a universe in which the SEC aims to take a pot shot at this saga by means of promoting market sanity and I am much more confident that there’s a world where Reddit is pushed to at least temporarily ban r/WallStreetBets for some unclear reason.Biden team is ""monitoring the situation"" around GameStop.— Jennifer Epstein (@jeneps) January 27, 2021']",,"['GameStop', 'Bitcoin’s', 'NavigationClose', 'GameStop', 'Bitcoin’s rise?Lucas', 'Bryce Durbin', 'GameStop', 'Blockbuster', 'AMC', 'GME', '@SSSulaa', 'FOMO', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'AMC', 'Bitcoin', 'Cameron Winklevoss', 'GameStop', 'Tesla', 'GameStop', 'GameStop’s', 'TD Ameritrade', 'Schwab', 'SEC', 'Biden', 'Jennifer Epstein', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'GameStop', 'Bitcoin’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/F2oXCah5Mv,2021-01-27T19:02:18,Robert Downey Jr. is launching a new ‘rolling’ venture fund to back sustainability startups,"['A little less than two years ago, when the actor, producer and investor Robert Downey Jr. unveiled his new, sustainability focused initiative called the FootPrint Coalition at Amazon’s re:MARS conference it was little more than a static website and a subscription prompt.Jump cut to today, and the firm now has five portfolio companies, a nonprofit initiative, and is launching a rolling venture fund, Footprint Coalition Ventures, at the World Economic Forum’s Digital Davos event.With the new rolling fund, managed through AngelList, Downey Jr.’s initiative sits at the intersection of two of the biggest ideas reshaping the world economy — the democratization of access to capital and investment vehicles and the $10 trillion opportunity to decarbonize global industry.It’s another arrow in the quiver for an institution that aims to combine storytelling, investing and nonprofit commitments to combat the world’s climate crisis.Rolling funds and the revolution in financeThere’s a revolution happening in finance right now, whether it’s the rise of the Redittors trying to avenge the malfeasance of short-sellers and big institutional investors that’s happening through investments in stocks like Blockbuster, Nokia, GameStop and AMC, or the new crowdfunding sources and rolling funds that are allowing regular investors to finance early-stage companies, things on Wall Street are definitely changing.And while the public market gambles are undoubtably minting some new millionaires, opening up access to interesting startup investments is a thesis that’s a stark contrast to the cynicism of day-trading gambles.Both could leave investors with less than zero in some cases, but with rolling funds or crowdfunding, there’s a real opportunity to build something rather than just sticking it to the man.Unlike traditional venture funds, rolling funds raise new capital commitments on a quarterly basis and invest as they go, hence the “rolling.” Investors come on for a minimum one-year commitment and invest at a quarterly cadence. In Downey Jr.’s fund that commitment amounts to $5,000 per quarter for up to 2,000 qualified investors (and a smaller number of accredited ones), according to a person with knowledge of the firm’s plans.“The idea of opening [the fund] to real people, rather than the ivory tower of the institutional bigwigs … It’s a little bit more Slamdance than Sundance [and] I kind of dig it,” said Downey Jr.A guide to recognizing FootPrint Coalition VenturesFootPrint Coalition Ventures will be split between early and late-stage investment funds and will be looking to make six investments per year in early-stage companies and four later-stage deals.Helping Downey Jr. manage the operations are investors like Jonathan Schulhof, who previously founded LOOM Media, which leverages smart urban infrastructure for advertising, founded Motivate International, which manages bike sharing services in cities across the U.S., and served as a managing partner for Global Technology Investments. Schulhof is joined by Steve Levin, who co-founded Team Downey, Downey Jr.’s media production company and Downey Ventures, which invests in media and technology companies.\xa0The firm already has four companies in its portfolio through investments it made using the founders’ own capital. And while those investments were all under $1 million, the firm expects that the size of its commitments will grow as it raises additional cash. Footprint Coalition has also maintained pro-rata investment rights so that it can increase the size of its stake in businesses over time. And the investments it made to date were sized in anticipation of potential for follow-ons at much higher valuations.A venture fund inside of a coalitionThe initiative that Downey Jr. hopes to build is more than just an investment arm. Both he and his co-founders see the investment side as a single piece of a broader platform that leverages the massive social following Downey Jr. has created and the storytelling skills he and his team have mastered through decades spent working in the movie business.That broader team includes Rachel Kropa, the former head of the CAA Foundation, who will lead scientific and philanthropic efforts and serve as the fund’s Impact Advisor and liaison to the scientific and research communities, according to a statement.Rachel Kropa, former head of the CAA Foundation who joined Footprint Coalition to lead scientific and philanthropic efforts last year, will serve as the fund’s Impact Advisor and liaison to the scientific and research communities.“The idea that the content that we made can be related back to the individual is very powerful,” said Kropa. “This problem is so intractable and interconnected across the world. It does matter that the fish that you eat are made using a sustainable feed.”Kropa is referring to a piece that the FootPrint Coalition put out around sustainable aquaculture tied to the group’s recent investment in Ÿnsect, a company that makes protein from mealworms* for use in animal feed and human food.“Our content around Cellular Agriculture, exemplifies the type of content we can create in the course of taking a deep dive into a particular industry. Though we have not (yet) invested in the space, we do believe there are interesting stories to tell,” said one person who works with the company.That media is additive to activate the group’s audience, and is not something that it charges for — or considers part of its investment valuation. “We’ve been creating edited video segments with Robert doing voice over and overlaying animation all of which we’ve been posting to social. We do this for free to the companies, and we don’t charge/strong-arm/cajole for warrants, advisor shares, or the like in return,” the person said.Weird science and sustainabilityWhile Ÿnsect is one example of a company that the FootPrint Coalition has backed that’s doing something that may be a little outside of the purview of most of Downey Jr.’s following, other businesses like the bamboo toilet paper company, Cloud Paper, and the new investment in the sustainability focused financial services company, Aspiration, have definite direct consumer ties.That balance is something that Schulhof said the firm was looking for as it pursues not just environmental and sustainability returns, but, more concretely, profit.“We look at things that are meaningful and impactful [and] I get to be purely capitalist. The question is this a good opportunity is something that has to do with its margins, its scale, its risk profile, the people involved and fundamentally what are the terms … do we think the company will deliver value to investors,” said Schulhof. “We’re looking for returns.”The opportunity for returns is enormous. As the group noted, the ESG sector — funds that focus on the environmental, social and governance issues — continues to grow rapidly. Part of the broader stakeholder capitalism movement, impact investing funds have topped $250 billion, and sustainability assets have doubled in value over the past three years.“We see two powerful trends working together to support the environment. First, engaging content and media distribution enable us to create a passionate community from Robert’s 100 million followers and to use that audience to access great investments. Second, a turnkey technology platform now enables us to manage a broad set of individual investors,” said Schulhof in a statement. “Venture funds traditionally have high minimums that exclude only the wealthiest individuals, or endowments and foundations. With much lower minimums and shorter investment periods, we can now offer access to these same companies to a much broader group. When these investors further ignite our passionate audience, we hope to set a positive feedback loop in motion with environmental technologies as the ultimate beneficiary.”Mark Cuban, Marc Benioff, Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi are investing in toilet paper']",Share on Twitter ,"['Robert Downey Jr.', 'Downey Jr.', 'Chris Unger', 'Robert Downey Jr.', 'the FootPrint Coalition', 'Amazon’s', 'Footprint Coalition Ventures', 'the World Economic Forum’s', 'Downey Jr.’s', 'Blockbuster', 'Nokia', 'GameStop', 'AMC', 'Downey Jr.’s', 'Downey Jr.', 'FootPrint Coalition', 'Helping Downey Jr.', 'Jonathan Schulhof', 'LOOM Media', 'Motivate International', 'Global Technology Investments', 'Schulhof', 'Steve Levin', 'Team Downey', 'Downey Jr.’s', 'Downey Ventures', 'Footprint Coalition', 'Downey Jr.', 'Downey Jr.', 'Rachel Kropa', 'the CAA Foundation', 'Rachel Kropa', 'the CAA Foundation', 'Kropa', 'the FootPrint Coalition', 'Robert', 'the FootPrint Coalition', 'Downey Jr.’s', 'Cloud Paper', 'Schulhof', 'Schulhof', 'ESG', 'Robert’s', 'Schulhof', 'Marc Benioff', 'Robert Downey Jr.', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'Uber', 'Dara Khosrowshahi', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'ForumRobert Downey Jr.', 'Robert Downey Jr.', 'the FootPrint Coalition', 'Amazon’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/1LbxZSQfb9,2021-01-27T18:18:33,Spin bets its scooter future on 3 wheels and remote-control tech,"['Spin, the micromobility startup acquired by Ford, has developed a new scooter with partners Segway-Ninebot and software startup Tortoise that aims to solve the sidewalk clutter problem for good.The Spin S-200 scooter not only has three wheels — a design change that helps it stand out in a crowded pool of two-wheelers — it’s also equipped with repositioning software that allows remote operators thousands of miles away to move vehicles off the sidewalk and into a proper parking spot. A fleet of about 300 Spin S-200 scooters will be tested in Boise, Idaho this spring. But the goal is much grander. Spin ultimately wants to roll out remotely operated scooters to cities in North America and Europe in 2021.These scooters, which operate on the so-called Spin Valet platform, are equipped with front and rear-facing cameras. When combined with Tortoise’s software, the scooters can be controlled remotely.The remote operations team will initially use the repositioning software to move the scooters if they’re blocking a sidewalk, crosswalk or handicapped space. Eventually, users will be able to hail a scooter, which will travel up to several blocks to their location, according to Tortoise co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko.\xa0“We’re focused on making Boise wildly successful and I think if that happens, then the numbers kind of take care of themselves,” Shevelenko said in a recent interview. “If this Spin scooter gets even 25% more rentals per day than their standard fleet, they’re going to shift their fleet as quickly as possible.”If that happens, the only real hurdle is getting the scooters manufactured. Shevelenko said a manufacturing bottleneck is unlikely because Segway-Ninebot has the tooling in place to make this a mass-produced product. “They have a lot of conviction around it,” he added in reference to Segway.Image Credits: Spin“There has been a lot of fanfare around the potential of remote-controlled e-scooters, but this partnership marks a turning point in tangible operational plans to bring them to city streets,” Spin’s chief business officer Ben Bear said in a statement. “In addition to providing reliability to consumers and more order to city streets, this could significantly improve unit economics, reducing carbon emissions and the operational work required to maintain and reposition fleets.”Shevelenko said as important as the reposition is, the design of the actual scooter deserves attention as well. The\xa0S-200 is equipped with three independent braking systems — a regenerative rear brake, front and rear drum brakes — and turn signals located on handlebars and near the rear wheel.“I think in some ways the three-wheeled scooter is as big of a deal,” Shevelenko said. “It’s necessary because it solves the balancing issue without a kickstand, but it’s also appealing to riders who aren’t dudes in their 20s. It’s higher up, you feel sturdier and it’s really hard to tip over and fall. And so, in terms of making sure people in their 40s and 50s and 60s feel comfortable getting on, I think this going to be very disruptive.”Remote-controlled delivery carts are now working for the local Los Angeles grocer']",TC Sessions: Justice,"['NavigationClose', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'SpinSpin', 'Ford', 'Segway', 'Tortoise', 'Spin Valet', 'Tortoise', 'Dmitry Shevelenko', 'Boise', 'Segway', 'Segway', 'Spin’s', 'Ben Bear', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsTCSegwaySpintortoiseSpin', 'Korosec7:18', 'Ford', 'Segway', 'Tortoise', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Can they get green cards?— Appreciative in AptosDear Appreciative:Congrats on becoming a citizen! That is a long road, and you did it. :) For all those out there awaiting citizenship, good news: It’s a priority for the Biden administration to speed up processing times. Other good news — the Muslim Ban is cancelled! And USCIS is going to make things a lot better for Dreamers seeking DACA.We can definitely figure out a plan to support your mom and stepdad to get green cards in the U.S. As your mom married your stepdad after you turned 18, you can’t sponsor him directly. You need to sponsor your mom for a green card first, and then she can sponsor him as her husband. My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, who is an expert in family-based immigration, and I discussed getting green cards for parents and siblings in a recent podcast. Check it out for more details. To set clear expectations, this is a multistep process that will probably take a few years. So you may want to consider hiring a nanny if you need childcare sooner than that! ;)Alternatively, to speed things up for your stepdad, if he has a daughter, son or sibling who is a U.S. citizen, any of them can sponsor him for a green card. If your mom ends up sponsoring him once she’s a permanent resident, that’s quicker than a U.S. citizen sibling sponsoring a brother, for example, but generally is not as quick as a U.S. citizen child sponsoring a parent.Since your mom is abroad, she won’t be able to come to the U.S. until the U.S. embassy or consulate in her home country reopens and resumes processing routine visa and green card applications. However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is currently open.Image Credits: Sophie Alcorn (opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)It’s possible to get started sponsoring your mom for a green card now, and you can work with an attorney to streamline the process. You need to be at least 21 years of age and be a U.S. citizen. As her sponsor, you will also need to accept legal responsibility for financially supporting her.You will need to initially submit to USCIS documents such as your birth certificate and proof of U.S. citizenship, and make sure that all foreign language documents have certified English translations. Currently, the USCIS California Service Center is taking about seven months to process green card applications for parents.']",,"['Bryce Durbin', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Sophie', 'Sophie', 'Sophie Alcorn', 'Biden', 'the Muslim Ban', 'USCIS', 'Dreamers', 'Anita Koumriqian', 'U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services', 'Sophie Alcorn', 'the USCIS California Service Center', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'ExpertsDear Sophieimmigrationimmigration', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

They’re also the same kind of algorithms that Google used to label photos of Black people as gorillas\xa0and that\xa0Microsoft’s Tay bot used to become a white supremacist.At TC Sessions: Justice, we’ll hear from three experts in this field. Let’s meet them.Dr. Safiya Umoja NobleImage Credits: Stella Kallnina (opens in a new window)Associate Professor at University of California Los Angeles a professor at the University of Southern California and author of “Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism,” Noble has become known for her analyses around the intersection of race and technology.In her aforementioned book, Noble discusses the ways in which algorithms are biased and perpetuate racism. She calls this data discrimination.“I think that the ways in which people get coded or encoded particularly in search engines can have an incredible amount of harm,” Noble told me back in 2018 on an episode of TC Mixtape, formerly known as CTRL+T. “And this is part of what I mean when I say data discrimination.”Mutale NkondeImage Credits: Via Mutale NkondeIt’s important to explicitly call out race in order to create just technological futures, according to Nkonde. In her research paper, “Automated Anti-Blackness: Facial Recognition in Brooklyn, New York,” Nkonde examines the use of facial recognition, the history of the surveillance of Black people in New York and presents potential ways to regulate facial recognition in the future.Nkonde is also a United Nations adviser on race and artificial intelligence and is currently working with Amnesty International to advance a global ban on facial recognition technology.Haben GirmaImage Credits: Courtesy of Haben GirmaAuthor of memoir “Haben: The Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harvard Law,” and human rights lawyer, Girma focuses on advancing disability justice.At Sight Tech Global last month, Girma spoke about how discussions around algorithmic bias as it pertains to race have become somewhat normalized, but too often do those conversations exclude the effects of algorithms on disabled people. Girma told me at that when it comes to robots, for example, the topic of algorithmic bias is lacking among developers and designers.“Don’t blame the robots,” she said. “It’s the people who build the robots who are inserting their biases that are causing ableism and racism to continue in our society.

https://t.co/j0GVALCkv6,2021-01-27T17:00:36,"Stilt, a financial services provider for immigrants, raises $100 million debt facility from Silicon Valley Bank","['Stilt founders Priyank Singh and Rohit MittalStilt, a provider of financial services for immigrants in the United States, announced today it has raised a $100 million warehouse facility from Silicon Valley Bank for lending to its customers. This brings Stilt’s total debt facilities so far to $225 million, and will enable it to reach more than $350 million in annualized loan volume. The company also announced the public launch of its no-fee checking accounts, which have been in private beta since September.A Y Combinator alum, Stilt was founded five years ago by Rohit Mittal and Priyank Singh. Both dealt with the challenges of accessing financial services as immigrants and wanted to created a company to serve other people without Social Security numbers or credit histories.For applicants without traditional credit reports, Stilt’s loan application process considers their personal information, including bank transactions, education, employment and visa status, and also uses proprietary machine-learning algorithms that draws on demographic data from a wide range of financial and non-financial sources.Stilt, which provides financial services for immigrants, raises $7.5 million seed roundTechCrunch last covered Stilt when it announced a $7.5 million seed round in May 2020.\xa0 During the pandemic, demand for loans increased for a wide range of reasons. Some customers sought new loans because their working hours got cut. Other borrowers’ own jobs weren’t impacted, but they needed to transfer money to family members in other countries who had lost income. Several used loans to pay for additional visa processing and many customers turned to Stilt because other financial providers shut down or reduced their loan programs over concerns about repayment.Despite the economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Stilt’s loan performance has remained steady. Many of Stilt’s customers are using their loans to build a credit history in the United States and even borrowers who lost income because of the pandemic continued making payments on time (Stilt also created temporary programs, including waiving interest for a few months, to help those who were struggling financially).Mittal said immigrants are also in general more creditworthy, because many moved to the United States to pursue educational or career opportunities.\xa0The difficulty of securing visas means “all immigrants move to the U.S. after jumping through a lot of hoops,” said Mittal. He added that “it isn’t just people coming from other countries. We also see it in DACA applicants. They tend to be the best risk-adjusted return customers. These are people who are going to school, they are working, they have seen their families work, they are helping their parents, they are doing all these things, and they understand the value of money, so they end up being a lot more financially responsible.”Stilt’s money transfer featureStilt’s new checking accounts, powered by Evolve Bank and Trust, are also designed for immigrants, with features like spot-rate remittance to about 50 countries. Users can also apply for credit lines and pre-approved loans through their accounts. Since opening to existing customers in September, the number of active checking accounts is growing 50% month over month, with many using it for direct deposits of their salaries.The new debt facility from Silicon Valley Bank means Stilt will be able to provide larger loan volumes and better interest rates, said Mittal. Stilt’s average interest rate is about 12% to 14%, compared to the 30% to 100% charged by other programs, like payday loans, that people without Social Security numbers or credit reports often use.Against all odds: The sheer force of immigrant startup founders']",Extra Crunch Live,"['Silicon Valley Bank', 'Priyank Singh', 'Rohit MittalStilt', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'Stilt', 'Rohit Mittal', 'Priyank Singh', 'Social Security', 'Stilt', 'Stilt', 'Stilt', 'Stilt', 'DACA', 'Evolve Bank and Trust', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'Stilt', 'Mittal', 'Social Security', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCBankingfinancial', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/wAtY5d9pxy,2021-01-27T06:08:57,ByteDance is cutting jobs in India amid prolonged TikTok ban,"['Chinese internet giant ByteDance has told employees in India that it is reducing the size of its team in the country after New Delhi retained ban on TikTok and other Chinese apps last week, said a source familiar with the matter and an internal memo obtained by TechCrunch. After the publication of this story, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed the layoff.The company, which employs more than 2,000 people in India, shared the news with employees in the country at 10 am local time and said only critical jobs will be retained in the country, said the source. More than two-thirds of the company’s workforce is expected to be eliminated,\xa0the source said. ByteDance said it was left with no choice after the Indian government, which banned its marquee app late June last year, had offered no clear direction on when TikTok could make return in the nation, the source said on the condition of anonymity.“It is deeply regretful that after supporting our 2000+ employees in India for more than half a year, we have no choice but to scale back the size of our workforce. We look forward to receiving the opportunity to relaunch TikTok and support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers in India,” a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch.Prior to the ban, India was the biggest international market for TikTok, which had amassed over 200 million monthly active users in the world’s second largest internet market. India blocked over 200 apps with links to China last year amid geopolitical tension between the two nations. New Delhi has said that these apps engaged in activities that posed threats to “national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India.”Last week, New Delhi told ByteDance and dozens of other Chinese firms that it maintains the concerns it had originally charged against them and would retain the ban.TikTok CEO Vanessa Pappas and VP of Global Business Blake Chandlee shared more context about the move in a memo to India employees today. “We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived, and that we would be able to resolve this quickly. Seven months later, we find that has not been the case. Many of you have patiently waited to hear how this would play out, which has been very stressful. Thank you for your continued belief and trust in us,” they wrote.“As you can imagine, a decision of this magnitude is not easy. For the last several months, our management team has worked tirelessly to avoid having to separate anyone from the company. We’ve cut expenses, while still paying benefits. However, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational. We are fully aware of the impact that this decision has for all of our employees in India, and we empathize with our team.”Today’s move caps some of the strangest and confusing months for ByteDance employees in India. Following the ban, the employees were told to focus on developing a range of other apps from the Chinese giant such as the productivity suite Lark that had not been blocked in India.TikTok is engaging with India over ban and already complies with local privacy and security requirements, CEO saysBut they were asked to not talk about these apps in the public to avoid putting risk of other ByteDance properties also getting the limelight. The source said ByteDance also stopped all marketing efforts in India to promote its other services in the country.“While we don’t know when we will make a comeback in India, we are confident in our resilience, and desire to do so in times to come,” Pappas and Chandlee wrote in the memo.In a statement on Wednesday, Ji Rong, spokesperson of Chinese Embassy in India, said the nation’s ban on Chinese apps violates guidelines by the World Trade Organization. “These moves in violation of WTO non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of market economy severely damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. The Chinese side firmly opposes them.”“The Chinese government always asks Chinese companies to observe international rules and local laws and regulations when doing business overseas. The Indian government has the responsibility to follow WTO rules and market principles and protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors including Chinese companies. These moves of the Indian government have also hindered the improvement of the Indian business environment and the innovative development of related Indian industries. China-India economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial by nature. We urge the Indian side to immediately correct its discriminatory measures and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation.”']",rising venture capital investment,"['TikTok', 'NavigationClose', 'TikTok', 'Bauer-Griffin/GC Images / Getty ImagesChinese', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'Vanessa Pappas', 'Lark', 'TikTok', 'ByteDance', 'Ji Rong', 'Chinese Embassy', 'the World Trade Organization', 'WTO', 'WTO', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'TikTok', 'Singh7:08 AM', 'TikTok', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/216REaU58D,2021-01-27T16:14:48,How 2 startups scaled to $50M ARR and beyond,"['The current list of venture-backed private companies we expect to go public — and the number of companies that might say yes to a SPAC-led debut — underscore just how many large startups there are in the market.After years of rising venture capital investment\xa0and a wave of huge rounds, many startups and unicorns could leave the private markets this year or the next.Last year, The Exchange wrote about former startups that had scaled to around the $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) mark, or had revenues that were roughly equivalent if they didn’t sell software. But that wound up being a bit less interesting than we’d hoped, as companies that have reached that scale tend to be fully baked by the time we got them on the phone.So, we’re shooting for the $50 million ARR range this year. Our goal is to see what we can ferret out from companies that are moving from the middle-late startup years and into the unicorn realm.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.What broke during the last year? Which teams have they doubled down on? How has hiring gone? We have questions. And, happily, companies have raised their hand. Today, we’re talking about OwnBackup and Assembly. Next week, it’s SimpleNexus and Kaseya. And we have Picsart on deck as a company somewhat in between our two target revenue bands.But before we start, a final note. The following bits of journalism are more exploratory than hard-hitting. But as private companies tend to share nothing other than the occasional press release strained of personality and flavor, I’m working to bring more raw data points and observations to you even if they do not constitute the grittiest reporting you’ve ever read.Let’s get into our first two $50 million (or around there) ARR companies.OwnBackupOwnBackup is a company you might have heard of as it raised a $50 million round last July, an event TechCrunch covered. The company reached out regarding our $50 million ARR series by noting that its growth had accelerated since that round, so we decided to find out more.The Exchange spoke with CEO Sam Gutmann and CMO Jamie Grenney about OwnBackup’s recent growth.According to the execs, OwnBackup is around $50 million ARR today. The company, as its name hints, provides cloud backup services to other companies. And it’s built atop the Salesforce platform, a service that had a good 2020 when nCino, another company that leverages the service, went public to great effect. (That debut led to TechCrunch reporting on the trend of building atop someone else’s software to IPO scale.)And OwnBackup has lots of room to grow inside of its current platform home. It thinks it has around 2% penetration of the Salesforce ecosystem, meaning that its current 100% yearly growth pace can continue for quite some time without a material change in strategy.Asked if OwnBackup was worried about platform risk, Gutmann and Grenney said they weren’t. Not only is Salesforce Ventures an investor, the execs noted, but the Salesforce platform is a huge SaaS ecosystem; it’s not something that could be switched off like a Google web product and consigned to the ash heap of the internet.']",Burberry recently facing a backlash,"['Nigel Sussman', 'Exchange', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'Exchange', 'Exchange', 'OwnBackup', 'Assembly', 'SimpleNexus', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'Exchange', 'Sam Gutmann', 'Jamie Grenney', 'OwnBackup’s', 'OwnBackup', 'ARR', 'Salesforce', 'OwnBackup', 'Salesforce', 'OwnBackup', 'Gutmann and Grenney', 'Salesforce Ventures', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'OwnBackup', 'Assembly', 'Alex Wilhelm5:14 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/RE9BwBq4jY,2021-01-27T15:13:47,Charlie launches a mobile app that ‘gamifies’ getting out of debt,"['Charlie, a personal finance app that began as a chatbot, is relaunching today with a revamped experience focused on the larger goal of helping everyday Americans get out of debt. To do so, Charlie presents users with a full picture of their current debt and how long it will take them to pay it off. Users then connect their bank account to Charlie for personalized assistance in reducing their bills. It also “gamifies” saving money to make the process of setting money aside for paying down debt more fun.According to Charlie CEO Ilian Georgiev, the idea to turn saving into more of a game arose from his prior experience in the mobile gaming industry. At a company called Pocket Gems, he helped scale apps that generated millions of dollars in revenue growth from across millions of users.CEO and co-founder Ilian Georgiev. Image Credits: Charlie“A really well-designed mobile game gets people to obsessively manage a virtual economy,” he explains. “And what I was curious about was how do we get people to do better in the real-world economy by using the same kind of tools?”To help on that front, Charlie’s team includes people with backgrounds in not only computer science and engineering, but also in psychology. Using similar psychological tricks as found in gaming — rules, progress bars and reward mechanisms — the app helps nudge its users toward saving.The original version of the Charlie app, launched in 2016, worked a little differently, however. It would analyze transaction data to look for areas where the user could improve their finances. It also worked over texting and through Facebook Messenger — platforms Charlie adopted with the idea that users needed a simpler way to connect with their finances.“But the thing that we kept hearing over and over again, both qualitatively and quantitatively, is that the biggest concern that our users had is, ‘How do I get out of debt?’ So then we said, instead of casting this really wide net … let’s laser focus on this one particular problem,” says Georgiev.Today, the chatbot still lives on as a feature inside the new Charlie app, but it’s not the core experience.Image Credits: CharlieInstead, users begin by providing the app with information about their debt. Georgiev stresses that many Americans often know their debt down to the penny — whether that’s how much they have left on student loans, how much left on their car, how much credit card debt they have and so on.The app then calculates how long it would take to pay off this debt if you only made minimum payments. This number helps shock people into action, as they’ll often discover they’re going to be in debt for another 40 or 50 years.“For most users, that’s an epiphany because they’ve never seen these numbers before, and the math required — even if you do it in Excel — the math required to figure that out is beyond most people,” Georgiev says.Image Credits: CharlieThe app then encourages users to learn how they can reduce the time it would take them to get out of debt by paying more than the minimums. By clicking a button, they can visualize the what happens if you pay, for example, $20 or $50 more per month.The final step is to help users find that extra cash. In part, this may come from savings the app locates on users’ behalf. But it also comes from the money-saving “game.”Charlie helps users create autosave rules which, when applied, auto-transfer money from the user’s connected bank account to Charlie’s digital wallet (an account held at partner bank, Evolve). These can be fun rules or even sort of ridiculous ones. For example, you could create “Guilty Pleasures” rules where Charlie will put away 10% every time you eat McDonalds, or it could save $1 for you every time a contestant on “The Bachelor” says they’re “here for the right reasons.”Image Credits: CharlieAs those rules apply, money is saved and a little progress bar fills. The app rewards you with rainbow confetti as you achieve, also similar to some mobile gaming experiences.At the end of the month, the user can take that saved money to make a larger payment toward their debt. Currently, Charlie doesn’t manage the bill pay aspects itself — which is a limitation. You have to transfer the funds back to your bank. But a bill pay feature is due to arrive in a couple months we’re told.Later this year, Charlie plans to offer debt refinancing services to users. In this case, the team believes they can give the users lower interest rates because Charlie users will have proven, through their use of the app, that they’re lower risk.Image Credits: CharlieFurther down the road, Charlie aims to move more into neobank territory by issuing a debit card to users that works with users’ Charlie account. To differentiate from the growing number of neobanks, Charlie will continue to focus on paying down debt and savings.Georgiev notes that the app’s business model is not built around user data collection, however. Data that’s ingested is sanitized and encrypted, and the app has a strict privacy policy. Plus, Charlie mainly helps people save money, but those funds are actually stored with a partner bank, not in Charlie itself. And because it’s involved in the act of moving money, it has to adhere to regulations around security and fraud prevention.Today, Charlie charges a $4.99 per month subscription, which the company aims to make up for by helping people reduce their larger debt loads more quickly. However, even that small amount could give money-sensitive users pause, despite Charlie’s perks and successes.To date, Charlie has registered a half million users for its older chatbot experience. It hopes to now grow that figure with its new tools.The app is available on iOS and Android.LeverEdge wants to get you and your friends a volume discount on student loans']",open letter in 2019,"['Charlie', 'NavigationClose', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Charlie CEO', 'Ilian Georgiev', 'Pocket Gems', 'Ilian Georgiev', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Facebook Messenger', 'Charlie', 'Georgiev', 'CharlieInstead', 'Georgiev', 'Charlie’s', 'Evolve', 'Charlie', 'McDonalds', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Georgiev', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Charlie', 'Charlie’s', 'Charlie', 'Android', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'debtSarah Perez4:13 PM', 'Charlie', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/z6e1AmNohu,2021-01-27T15:13:17,Finesse raises $4.5M to predict fashion trends with AI,"['Finesse, a startup promising to take the guesswork and waste out of fashion, is announcing that it has raised $4.5 million in seed and pre-seed funding.Founder and CEO Ramin Ahmari said the tremendous waste in the fashion industry has become a badly kept secret, with Burberry recently facing a backlash over its practice of burning unwanted products, and the industry as a whole producing an estimated 13 million tons of textile waste each year.Finesse is looking to change that, Ahmari said, in part by taking advantage of the fact that fashion trends are moving out of the “hermetically sealed” world of catwalks and onto social media, where new products take off “on the backs and bodies and posts” of influencers like Kylie Jenner.“This is data we have access to,” he said. Noting that he previously worked in finance, Ahmari added that the stock market is “much more unpredictable” than the fashion industry — there just hasn’t been a tech startup applying tools like natural language processing and deep learning to fashion.“In the simplest terms, you can think of what we do as seeing when Kylie posts a picture on Instagram and people go crazy about it … and then you see that happen not just on Kylie’s post but across Instagram, TikTok, Google Trends,” he said. “We predict the establishing of a trend before it goes super viral.”Image Credits: FinesseFinesse then uses this data to design new products. Ahmari said that by taking advantage of a “very fast supply chain,” along with tools like CLO 3D-modeling software, Finesse can go from identifying a trend to having a product available for purchase in less than 25 days.While the startup is officially launching today, it’s already been selling products through “drops,” where customers vote for and pre-order products that will only be available in limited quantities. Ahmari said Finesse focuses on selling unique pieces rather than staples, but because it’s confident about consumer demand, it can keep things much more affordable — the products currently for sale range from $8 to $116.Unlike most fashion companies, Ahmari said that Finesse does not need to employ a giant design department, although he suggested that team members like Vice President of Product Andrea Knopf and Head of Product Development Brittany Fleck — who work in tandem with the startup’s algorithms — are “artists in their own right.”“Unless we have true AI — which we’re very far from — you are never going to have a machine that’s purely creative,” he said. “You have to have feedback cycles … What we are eliminating is the job where it’s just an intern doing grunt work, all of these people just going through Instagram to find new fashion trends.”Ahmari also said that with its emphasis on sustainability and connecting with the LGBTQ community (Ahmari identifies as queer and nonbinary, and all of the startup’s products are designed for any gender), Finesse is aimed squarely at Gen Z consumers who are tired of fashion dictated by “white, older, cisgender men.”The startup’s investors include former Twitter Head of Engineering Alex Roetter, Collective Health CEO Ali Diab, Hoxton Ventures, MaC Venture Capital, Mango Capital and Fab Fit Fun co-founder Sam Teller.“We believe that Finesse is truly the future of fashion, from its trend prediction to sustainable supply chain and manufacturing,” said MaC Managing Partner Marlon Nichols in a statement. “We hope other fashion brands can learn from Finesse’s disruption in the space and we’re eager to see what’s next.”Amazon Fashion launches a custom clothing service, Made for You']",Pinecone,"['AI', 'NavigationClose ScreenFinesse', 'AIAnthony Ha@anthonyha /', 'FinesseFinesse', 'Ramin Ahmari', 'Burberry', 'Finesse', 'Ahmari', 'Kylie Jenner', 'Ahmari', 'Instagram', 'FinesseFinesse', 'Ahmari', 'CLO', 'Finesse', 'Ahmari', 'Finesse', 'Ahmari', 'Finesse', 'Andrea Knopf', 'LGBTQ', 'Ahmari', 'Finesse', 'Gen Z', 'Twitter Head', 'Alex Roetter', 'Ali Diab', 'Hoxton Ventures', 'MaC Venture Capital', 'Mango Capital', 'Sam Teller', 'Finesse', 'MaC', 'Marlon Nichols', 'Finesse’s', 'YouclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Venture CapitalMarlon NicholsFinesse', 'AIAnthony', 'Ramin Ahmari', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

At $60, it’s $40 cheaper than the standard Video Doorbell – and prices from there go up significantly, with the “Elite” running $350.Perhaps the company is feeling some pressure from the race the bottom for smart home hardware pricing. Wyze, notably, has done the Wyze thing, launching a $30 doorbell along with a slew of other products in September. Though as of this writing, that device is still listed as a “pre-order.”The Wyze device was expected to be available this month, but has since been pushed back to February. The Ring Video Doorbell Wired is also currently slated for next month, with a shipping date of the 24th. As the name suggests, the new product is only available in a hardwired option – which could be a deal breaker for some. Other standard features here include 1080p video with night vision, motion zones that trigger notifications and two-way audio with noise cancelation built-in. It’s also the company’s smallest doorbell to date.The Amazon-owned company is, of course, not without its share of controversy.

https://t.co/Ty7TgdX4uJ,2021-01-27T15:00:28,Pinecone lands $10M seed for purpose-built machine learning database,"['Pinecone, a new startup from the folks who helped launch Amazon SageMaker, has built a vector database that generates data in a specialized format to help build machine learning applications faster, something that was previously only accessible to the largest organizations. Today the company came out of stealth with a new product and announced a $10 million seed investment led by Wing Venture Capital.Company founder Edo Liberty says that he started the company because of this fundamental belief that the industry was being held back by the lack of wider access to this type of database. “The data that a machine learning model expects isn’t a JSON record, it’s a high dimensional vector that is either a list of features or what’s called an embedding that’s a numerical representation of the items or the objects in the world. This [format] is much more semantically rich and actionable for machine learning,” he explained.He says that this is a concept that is widely understood by data scientists, and supported by research, but up until now only the biggest and technically superior companies like Google or Pinterest could take advantage of this difference. Liberty and his team created Pinecone to put that kind of technology in reach of any company.The startup spent the last couple of years building the solution, which consists of three main components. The main piece is a vector engine to convert the data into this machine-learning ingestible format. Liberty says that this is the piece of technology that contains all the data structures and algorithms that allow them to index very large amounts of high dimensional vector data, and search through it in an efficient and accurate way.The second is a cloud hosted system to apply all of that converted data to the machine learning model, while handling things like index lookups along with the pre- and post-processing — everything a data science team needs to run a machine learning project at scale with very large workloads and throughputs. Finally, there is a management layer to track all of this and manage data transfer between source locations.Tecton.ai nabs $35M Series B as it releases machine learning feature storeOne classic example Liberty uses is an eCommerce recommendation engine. While this has been a standard part of online selling for years, he believes using a vectorized data approach will result in much more accurate recommendations and he says the data science research data bears him out.“It used to be that deploying [something like a recommendation engine] was actually incredibly complex, and […] if you have access to a production grade database, 90% of the difficulty and heavy lifting in creating those solutions goes away, and that’s why we’re building this. We believe it’s the new standard,” he said.The company currently has 10 people including the founders, but the plan is to double or even triple that number, depending on how the year goes. As he builds his company as an immigrant founder — Liberty is from Israel — he says that diversity is top of mind. He adds that it’s something he worked hard on at his previous positions at Yahoo and Amazon as he was building his teams at those two organizations. One way he is doing that is in the recruitment process. “We have instructed our recruiters to be proactive [in finding more diverse applicants], making sure they don’t miss out on great candidates, and that they bring us a diverse set of candidates,” he said.Looking ahead to post-pandemic, Liberty says he is a bit more traditional in terms of office versus home, and that he hopes to have more in-person interactions. “Maybe I’m old fashioned but I like offices and I like people and I like to see who I work with and hang out with them and laugh and enjoy each other’s company, and so I’m not jumping on the bandwagon of ‘let’s all be remote and work from home’.”How artificial intelligence will be used in 2021']",blew up the trading fee economy,"['NavigationClose', 'PineconePinecone', 'Amazon SageMaker', 'Wing Venture Capital', 'Edo Liberty', 'Google or Pinterest', 'Liberty', 'Liberty', 'eCommerce', 'Liberty', 'Yahoo', 'Amazon', 'Liberty', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Amazon SageMaker', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

This continuous transformation is what is happening to businesses. And we do know from working together with them, that actually they agree with those fundamentals. They want to be an intelligent enterprise. They want to adapt and change. But the key question is how to get there? And the key question they ask us is, please help us to get there.”With RISE for SAP, businesses will get a single contact at SAP to help guide them through their journey, but also access to the SAP partner ecosystem.The first step in this process, Denecken stressed, isn’t necessarily to bring in new technology, though that is also part of it, but to help businesses redesign and optimize their business processes and implement the best practices in their verticals — and then measure the outcome. “Business process redesign means that you analyze how your business processes perform. How can you get tailored recommendations? How can you benchmark against industry standards? And this helps you to set the tone and also to motivate your people — your IT, your business people — to adapt,” Denecken described. He also noted that in order for a digital transformation project to succeed, IT and business leaders and employees have to work together.In part, that includes technology offerings and adopting robotic process automation (RPA), for example. As Denecken stressed, all of this builds on top of the work SAP has done with its customers over the years to define business processes and KPIs.On the technical side, SAP is obviously offering its own services, including its Business Technology Platform, and cloud infrastructure, but it will also support customers on all of the large cloud providers. Also included in RISE is support for more than 2,200 APIs to integrate various on-premises, cloud and non-SAP systems, access to SAP’s low-code and no-code capabilities and, of course, its database and analytics offerings.“Geopolitical tensions, environmental challenges and the ongoing pandemic are forcing businesses to deal with change faster than ever before,” said Christian Klein, SAP’s CEO, in today’s announcement. “Companies that can adapt their business processes quickly will thrive – and SAP can help them achieve this. This is what RISE with SAP is all about: It helps customers continuously unlock new ways of running businesses in the cloud to stay ahead of their industry.”With this new offering, SAP is now providing its customers with a number of solutions that were previously available through its partner ecosystem. Denecken doesn’t see this as SAP competing with its own partners, though. Instead, he argues that this is very much a partner play and that this new solution will likely only bring more customers to its partners as well.“Needless to say, this has been a negotiation with those partners,” he said. “Because yes, it’s sometimes topics that we now take over they [previously] did. But we are looking for scale here. The need in the market for digital transformation has just started. And this is where we see that this is definitely a big offering, together with partners. “']",acquiring Optimizely last fall,"['NavigationClose', 'Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg / Getty ImagesSAP', 'RISE', 'SAP’s', 'Sven Denecken', 'COO', 'Transformation', 'Denecken', 'RPA', 'Denecken', 'Business Technology Platform', 'RISE', 'Christian Klein', 'SAP’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Lardinois4:00', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/jt1dqU6V4g,2021-01-27T14:27:19,"GameStop, meme stocks, and the revenge of the retail trader","[""GameStop shares are set to rally 70% this morning when trading starts, and AMC shares opened up 300%, extending a run that has perplexed market observers, irked hedge funds, and generally made crypto’s recent gains appear soft and weak.Being a retail trader is mostly being a sucker, hoping to best the markets while lacking the infrastructure, access, and information that professionals enjoy. Hell, most professional fund managers that regular folks can invest in fail to beat the market. That’s one reason why index funds and other passive investments that merely track aggregate performance have grown so much in recent years; why pay more to have someone make you less money than simply making the same returns as the S&P 500?Things have changed some in recent years. Robinhood blew up the trading fee economy, and now along with a host of similar companies — Public.com with its social focus, Freetrade in the UK, and so forth — has made retail investing far more accessible than it was before to more folks. And we’re all trapped inside. And a rude, jokey Reddit forum has gone from in-nerd joke to front-page news after its users started to push their weight around.It’s something that was noted by none other than the founder of Reddit Alexis Ohanian who shared some thoughts on Twitter.And it's a perfect storm at a time when lots of people are hurting, interest rates are so low, inescapable student loan debts loom, and every major institution has caught Ls during a /global pandemic/ over the last year. This is something to believe in.— Alexis Ohanian Sr.  (@alexisohanian) January 27, 2021It’s an old saw that back in the dotcom boom traders would congregate in chat rooms to share tips, lie to each other, and try to pump their own equities higher. That all still happens. But what has changed is that the combination of mature social platforms and free trading has at once boosted access to the public markets\xa0while Reddit and other online congregation points have provided a simpler way for retail investors, the hoi polloi, to fuck around and make other people find out.Again, Ohanian’s thoughts on this resonate.“A couple hundred thousand years of evolution conditioned us to believe in and rally around the immediate tribe around us. The idea of an ‘institution’ – a faceless, nameless entity we just have to trust — is actually pretty foreign to our species,” the venture investor wrote on Twitter. “I know they’re all ‘random people on the internet’ but there’s a lot more empathy and community there than people realize. It’s why I’ve been saying for 15 years that (online) community is still massively undervalued.”This is what has happened with GameStop, a company that until recently was unnotable, and stuck between a physical retail footprint, the pandemic, and its customers increasingly preferring digital game purchases. It was worth around $4 per share last summer. It started 2021 worth around $18. Now it’s $147.98 after rising 92.7% yesterday, and is up $69.02 this morning, or 46.6%.How did that happen? No, the company did not get suddenly, radically stronger in short order. Instead, a coterie of Reddit users realized that GameStop was shorted by more than 100%. That means that investors had bet more shares than existed in the company that it would lose value.And mostly this would have been fine, a quirk of the market; other highly-shorted stocks can see a majority of their shares sold short, but to see a short-percentage of greater than 100% was eyebrow-raising.Then came the wager: If big investors had bet more shares than GameStop had in existence that it would lose value, what would happen if lots of individuals investors — retail interest, as they say — started buying the stock? That might drive its value up, forcing the hedge funds and other big capital pools to decide whether to hold onto their negative bet and take strong paper losses as GameStop rallied, or cover their short, buying the stock at a higher price than they initially paid for it, losing money. Covering shorts would require buying the stock at high prices, perhaps boosting its value yet again.It’s the wildest short-squeeze we can recall.There’s always tension between short-sellers and investors who prefer to make positive wagers. Indeed, shorts are generally hated and the term perma-bear, slang for someone who is chronically worried about the price of assets to the point of distraction,1 is often levied at them.But\xa0a boom in retail investing\xa0and social platforms allowing the congregation of disparate individual investors\xa0can do quite a lot, it turns out. So, users of the WallStreetBets sub-Reddit started buying GameStop. And they kept doing so, pushing its price higher and higher.The result was that big money got smacked in the shorts, literally. CNBC reports that short-sellers have lost more than $5 billion so far thanks to GameStop’s rapid appreciation on the back of becoming an internet meme.But the tug-of-war between professionals betting that GameStop is not worth its inflated price, and that it will fall, is not over. Short interest remains high. So, even if some pro investors have cried uncle and exited their trade, the retail revenge on the so-called smart money is hardly a sure thing; what those excitable individuals may have done is merely set up a more enticing short position for hedge funds than had existed before.GameStop has a lot further to fall from over $140 per share than it did from $18, say.Of course no one knows what will happen today. The investors who have taken out more short positions during the rally are set to eat their own ties this morning when GameStop opens higher. Perhaps they will hold, and eventually their short bet will pay off. Or perhaps retail will be able to keep rallying GameStop until, well, no one really knows.But while most folks have their retirement accounts in investments so boring you’ve forgotten their names — Fidelity Freedom 2060 Fund, or what have you — small-time investors are sticking it to the man. This is the political war underneath the trading scrap. Retail is generally said to be mad at being pushed around, front-run, and generally speaking operating as second-class investing citizens. The GameStop gambit is, to some degree, revenge.Not that it will matter, per se, in the long-term. Large investing groups will still crush retail, having access to better information and tools and the like, as we mentioned up top. But today, at least, those same concerns are going to start the day with huge paper losses on their GameStop shorts.And that’s hilarious, because the company is obviously overvalued and individuals simply do not give a fuck.I, Alex Wilhelm, am like this before coffee.\xa0\xa0""]",,"['NavigationClose', 'AFP / Getty', 'AMC', 'Public.com', 'Alexis Ohanian', 'Ls', 'Alexis Ohanian Sr.', 'GameStop', 'GameStop', 'GameStop', 'GameStop', 'GameStop', 'CNBC', 'GameStop’s', 'GameStop', 'Fidelity Freedom 2060 Fund', 'Alex Wilhelm', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Wilhelm', 'Jonathan Shieber3:27 PM', 'AMC', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Companies today of any size, any scale [need to be] much more sophisticated in terms of how they digitally connect with their customers. It’s a never-ending story.”At the same time, he emphasized that Episerver is making the change from “a position of strength,” with the combined company seeing double-digit revenue growth last year and going live with more than 250 new customers.Asked whether adopting the Optimizely name was always part of the post-acquisition plan, Atzberger replied, “When we acquired Optimizely, we knew that we would be acquiring not just a great product, not just a great customer base, but also acquiring a very well-known brand. We had not yet decided on [rebranding], but it was certainly something that, for me, was part of the consideration.”In addition to announcing the new company name, Episerver/Optimizely is also announcing a new platform that it’s calling Optimization-as-a-Service, which integrates aspects of Optimizely and Episerver products to offer web targeting, testing and recommendations.

https://t.co/U2kQt5kbAZ,2021-01-27T14:00:46,"Lynk, a “knowledge-as-a-service” platform with more than 840,000 experts, raises $24 million","['Lynk co-founder and chief executive officer Peggy ChoiLynk, a “knowledge-as-a-service” platform that connects clients with over 840,000 experts in a wide range of fields, announced today it has raised $24 million led by Brewer Lane Ventures and MassMutual Ventures, with participation from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund. The company uses machine learning algorithms to match users, who include investment firms, Fortune 100 companies and government entities, with experts on its platform, helping connect them with people they would probably not find at traditional consultancies or by searching online.“At the core of it, the search is a people search based on what you know, and not just where you work, to put it very simply,” co-founder and chief executive officer Peggy Choi told TechCrunch.Founded in 2015, Lynk has now raised a total of $30 million. It has more than 200 employees across offices in eight cities: Hong Kong, New York City, Singapore, London, Mumbai, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Toronto and Manila. Its funding will be used for product launches and to expand in North America and China, where its seen demand grow over the past twelve months.Lynk’s flagship product, Lynk Answers, is currently used by about 200 enterprise clients when their employees need to do research for projects including geographical expansion, product-market fit and due diligence, with many relying on the platform for on-the-ground research in areas they can’t travel to because of the pandemic. For example, investors talk with advisors on Lynk to understand new technology or the dynamics in a sector. Over the past few years, companies have used Lynk to help them react quickly to geopolitical changes, including events that affected their supply chain. Some sought supply chain experts when shipments got stuck in customs or they wanted to diversify their manufacturing by setting up factories in Southeast Asia.Before Lynk, Choi worked in finance, including at Silver Lake in London and TPG in San Francisco. As an investor, “every day you have to do a lot of conversations with executives and different kinds of experts to learn about new industries or companies really quickly. Through that experience, I realized that talking to the right person makes a huge difference,” she said.In contrast, Choi found herself at a loss when her parents wanted to launch an art gallery. “They had all these day-to-day business questions and sometimes they asked me because they thought I would know how to address it. But I don’t know either, I’m not the right person for them, so I had to find the right people,” she said. “When I saw that contrast, I thought, what about using data to organize people in a way based on what they know?”Lynk, which monetizes by charging enterprise clients a subscription fee, fills the gap between traditional consultancies and consumer-oriented Q&A platforms like Quora or China’s Zhihu. The platform also includes SaaS features that provide an alternative to email chains, like collaboration tools and auto-transcription for expert interviews so they can be organized, searched and referenced by a team.How Zhihu has become one of China’s biggest hubs for expertsLynk’s experts, who the platform calls “Knowledge Partners,” include C-suite executives, independent consultants, lawyers, engineers, financial analysts and scientists, among others. The company finds them through several channels, including digital marketing, a referral program for current Knowledge Partners and partnerships with groups, associations and institutions. Lynk vets experts before they are added to the platform, where they set their own rates.When users have a question, Lynk’s search engine shows them a list of experts based on criteria like domain expertise and geography. Then they ask potential experts a couple of questions to see if they are the right match. Lynk uses data from those conversations, on an anonymized basis, to refine its search technology and make matching more accurate. Once users pick experts, they work with them in different ways. Most of the time they do a question-and-answer session. Sometimes that turns into speaker and workshop engagements or longer-term projects.Choi said building an inclusive roster of experts is a priority for Lynk. The company’s team and board are divided equally between women and men and represent more than 20 nationalities. It wants to build a diverse database through initiatives like outreach programs and campaigns like Lynk Elite Expert Women to recruit people, including those who haven’t done consulting before.“When we were running the [Lynk Elite Expert Women] campaign, we realized that a lot of people find it a very new way of being valued,” said Choi. “Especially if they’ve spent their entire life doing something, they also want to know what people want to know about their area.”proSapient raises $10M Series A led by Smedvig Capital to expand expert network platformTwo Sigma leads $12m series A for expert knowledge network NewtonX']",LottieFiles,"['NavigationClose', 'Shu@catherineshu', 'Peggy ChoiLynk', 'Brewer Lane Ventures', 'MassMutual Ventures', 'Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund', 'Peggy Choi', 'Lynk', 'Lynk’s', 'Lynk Answers', 'Lynk', 'Lynk, Choi', 'TPG', 'Choi', 'Q&A', 'Knowledge Partners', 'Lynk’s', 'Choi', 'Lynk Elite Expert Women', 'Choi', 'Smedvig Capital', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCAsiaconsultinghong', 'Brewer Lane Venture', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/2f5cEholKR,2021-01-27T14:00:40,Literati raises $40M for its book club platform,"['Literati has raised a $40 million Series B to pursue an unusual startup opportunity — namely, book clubs.Founder and CEO Jessica Ewing (a former product manager at Google) explained that the Austin-based company started out with book clubs for kids, before launching its Luminary brand for adult book clubs last year. And the Luminary clubs live up to the name — they’re curated by notable figures such as activist and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, NBA star Stephen Curry, entrepreneur and philanthropist Sir Richard Branson, journalist Susan Orlean and the Joseph Campbell Foundation.When you sign up for a Literati book club, you receive a print edition of each month’s selection with a note from the curator. You also get access to the Literati app, where you can discuss the book with other readers, and where curators host author conversations. For example, Curry is leading a book club focused on nonfiction about people who “transcend expectations” (he invested in Literati as well), while Yousafzai chooses books by women “with bold ideas from around the world.”Ewing told me that she’s trying to build the first “new, innovative bookseller” since Amazon launched 25 years ago. And she’s doing that by focusing on curation.“There’s too much choice, too many lists, it’s completely overwhelming for most people,” she said. She argued that it helps to enlist celebrities and other big names to do that curation: “Books are aspirational. No one aspires to play more video games, people aspire to read more … People want their books to be recommended by someone a little bit smarter than they are.”Literati CEO Jessica EwingEwing’s hope for Literati is to create “the next great literary social network,” bridging the gap between celebrity-driven lists like Oprah’s Book Club\xa0and Reese’s Book Club and what she described as “the wine-and-cheese, super intimate model.”“I would love to see in-person meetups once we’re out of the COVID environment,” she added. “But I also think there’s everything in between. We’re enabling threaded discussions [in the app] right now, and it’s cool to have asynchronous conversations about the books.”And on the children’s book side, Literati is also working to build personalization tools designed to recommend the best books for each child.“To me,\xa0this is one of the most exciting applications: How do we make this generation of kids love reading by pairing them with the right books?” Ewing said.Literati previously raised $12 million in funding from Shasta Ventures and others, according to Crunchbase. The new round was led by Aydin Senkut of Felicis Ventures, with participation from Dick Costolo and Adam Bain of 01 Advisors, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, Shasta, Silverton Partners, Springdale Ventures and, as previously noted, Stephen Curry.“I wanted to start my own book club with Literati, because their mission to better the world through reading naturally aligns with my values as an entrepreneur and father,” Curry said in a statement. “I was a fan before I was an investor, and am so proud to be a part of a company that works to better the lives of others, one book at a time.”Gift Guide: The best books for 2020 recommended by VCs and TechCrunch writers (Part 1)']",,"['NavigationClose ScreenLiterati', 'LiteratiLiterati', 'Jessica Ewing', 'Google', 'Luminary', 'Luminary', 'Malala Yousafzai', 'NBA', 'Stephen Curry', 'Richard Branson', 'Susan Orlean', 'the Joseph Campbell Foundation', 'Curry', 'Amazon', 'Jessica EwingEwing’s', 'Oprah’s Book Club', 'Reese’s Book Club', 'Literati', 'Shasta Ventures', 'Crunchbase', 'Aydin Senkut', 'Felicis Ventures', 'Dick Costolo', 'Adam Bain', 'General Catalyst', 'Shasta', 'Silverton Partners', 'Springdale Ventures', 'Stephen Curry', 'Curry', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Senkutdick costoloFelicis', 'CatalystliteratiMalala Yousafzairichard', 'Jessica Ewing', 'Google', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The platform includes Lottie creation, editing and testing tools, and a marketplace for animations. It now claims about one million users from 65,000 companies, including Airbnb, Google, TikTok, Disney and Netflix, and 300% year-over-year growth. The new funding brings its total raised to about $10 million.Smaller than GIF or PNG graphics, Lottie animations also have the advantage of being scalable and interactive.

https://t.co/WaYxh1MpX7,2021-01-27T13:30:49,Classiq raises $10.5M Series A round for its quantum software development platform,"['Classiq, a Tel Aviv-based startup that aims to make it easier for computer scientists and developers to create quantum algorithms and applications, today announced that it has raised a $10.5 million Series A round led by Team8 Capital and Wing Capital. Entrée Capital, crowdfunding platform OurCrowd and Sumitomo Corporation (through IN Venture) also participated in this round, which follows the company’s recent $4 million seed round led by Entrée Capital.The idea behind Classiq, which currently has just under a dozen members on its team, is that developing quantum algorithms remains a major challenge.“Today, quantum software development is almost an impossible task,” said Nir Minerbi, CEO and Co-founder of Classiq. “The programming is at the gate level, with almost no abstraction at all. And on the other hand, for many enterprises, that’s exactly what they want to do: come up with game-changing quantum algorithms. So we built the next layer of the quantum software stack, which is the layer of a computer-aided design, automation, synthesis. […] So you can design the quantum algorithm without being aware of the details and the gate level details are automated.”Image Credits: ClassiqWith Microsoft’s Q#, IBM’s Qiskit and their competitors, developers already have access to quantum-specific languages and frameworks. And as Amir Naveh, Classiq’s VP of R&D told me, just like with those tools, developers will define their algorithms as code — in Classiq’s case a variant of Python. With those other languages, though, you will write sequences of gates on the cubits to define your quantum circuit.“What you’re writing down isn’t gates on cubits, its concepts, its constructs, its constraints — it’s always constraints on what you want the circuit to achieve,” Naveh explained. “And then the circuit is synthesized from the constraints. So in terms of the visual interface, it would look the same [as using other frameworks], but in terms of what’s going through your head, it’s a whole different level of abstraction, you’re describing the circuit at a much higher level.”This, he said, gives Classiq’s users the ability to more easily describe what they are trying to do. For now, though, that also means that the platform’s users tend to be quantum teams and scientists and developers who are quantum experts and understand how to develop quantum circuits at a very deep level. The team argues, though, that as the technology gets better, developers will need to have less and less of an understanding of how the actual qubits behave.As Minerbi stressed, the tool is agnostic to the hardware that will eventually run these algorithms. Classiq’s mission, after all, is to provide an additional abstraction layer on top of the hardware. At the same time, though, developers can optimize their algorithms for specific quantum computing hardware as well.Classiq CTO Dr. Yehuda Naveh also noted that the company is already working with a number of larger companies. These include banks that have used its platform for portfolio optimization, for example, and a semiconductor firm that was looking into a material science problem related to chip manufacturing, an area that is a bit of a sweet spot for quantum computing — at least in its current state.The team plans to use the new funding to expand its existing team, mostly on the engineering side. A lot of the work the company is doing, after all, is still in R&D. Finding the right software engineers with a background in physics — or quantum information experts who can program — will be of paramount importance for the company. Minerbi believes that is possible, though, and the plan is to soon expand the team to about 25 people.“We are thrilled to be working with Classiq, assisting the team in achieving their goals of advancing the quantum computing industry,” said Sarit Firon, Managing Partner at Team8 Capital. “As the quantum era takes off, they have managed to solve the missing piece in the quantum computing puzzle, which will enable game-changing quantum algorithms. We look forward to seeing the industry grow, and witnessing how Classiq continues to mark its place as a leader in the industry.”Silq is a new high-level programming language for quantum computersQuantum startup CEO suggests we are only five years away from a quantum desktop computer']",Playvox,"['NavigationClose', 'ClassiqClassiq', 'Team8 Capital and Wing Capital', 'Entrée Capital', 'OurCrowd', 'Sumitomo Corporation', 'Entrée Capital', 'Classiq', 'Nir Minerbi', 'Classiq', 'Microsoft’s', 'IBM', 'Qiskit', 'Amir Naveh', 'Classiq’s VP', 'Classiq’s', 'Naveh', 'Classiq’s', 'Minerbi', 'CTO', 'Yehuda Naveh', 'Classiq', 'Sarit Firon', 'Managing Partner', 'Team8 Capital', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'AvivClassiq', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Rav15f5uZD,2021-01-27T13:13:08,"TCV closes record $4B fund to invest in e-commerce, fintech, edtech, travel and more","['The pandemic has spelled economic setbacks for many people and industries, but the capital swirling about the technology world continues to roar along. In the latest development, TCV — the storied venture capital firm behind the likes of Airbnb, Spotify, Peloton and Facebook — has closed a record $4 billion for its latest fund.This is not only the company’s biggest fund to date, but it also speaks to just how fast the tech industry is accelerating in terms of capital and how much of it tech is attracting. In 25 years of operations (a milestone it passed in 2020) TCV invested $14 billion across hundreds of startups. This latest $4 billion fund raised in a matter of months represents nearly 30% of that figure.(It’s also more than the company originally targeted, which was $3.25 billion.)Parter John Doran told TechCrunch the plan will be to use the money to continue backing existing portfolio companies, as well as make new bets, both in areas that have shown to be very strong winners in the last year — e-commerce, education, and tools to enable working in the cloud, for example — but also investments in areas that may not be doing as well right now, but TCV will believes will return, like travel.“We have to take a long term view,” he said in an interview. “It’s about great founders and CEOs, and where those in areas like travel, you’ll still see the startups get funded at up rounds. Besides, who will be better positioned to grow and take advantage of a world that’s now more digital? That is a huge opportunity in the long term.”As with other big capital events, the closing of a VC fund may not be intrinsically interesting news in itself, but it’s a significant bellwether that points to the level of confidence, interest and activity in the early stages of the funding process. That, in turn, has a direct knock-on effect for startups, and subsequently the technology industry at large.In the case of TCV XI, as it is known, it’s a sign of strength in the market — it is $1 billion more than its previous fund, closed before the pandemic in 2019 — but also an endorsement of some of the less traditional processes and practices that have become the norm in many of our lives.Notably, the raising (and closing) of the fund was done entirely virtually over the last year, Julia Roux, the company’s head of investor relations, told TechCrunch, from a mix of returning and new LPs. Going virtual is also, in many cases, the route that TCV (and other VCs) have taken in closing deals over the last year too, which looks like it may now be here to stay.TCV has been very active in the past year, not just with private startup investments but seeing one of its most successful startups go public. Airbnb boldly went for an IPO in December, in the wake of a year that saw its business providing accommodation and other services to travellers come to a grinding halt.The IPO was an example of the kind of more long-term investing that the firm is keen on doing (and very much has the funds to do now) despite current market conditions. Doran pointed out that TCV remains a “big believers in the Airbnb story,” investing in more shares in the company in the IPO.Other big investments this year have included a lot of activity in commerce and fintech — including Mollie (raised $106 million), Spryker ($130 million), Revolut ($500 million), Klarna ($650 million), Nubank ($400 million) and Mambu ($135 million) — and Strava ($110 million). (Note how many of those rounds were outside the U.S.: almost all of them. The company says it has some $4 billion under management outside the U.S. now.)Recent exits include AxiomSL, Genesys, Cradlepoint, and Silver Peak.“We are humbled by the ongoing support of new and returning investors, which enabled us to raise a record sized fund,” said Jay Hoag, a founding general partner at TCV, in a statement. “Just as importantly, we are honored by all the great entrepreneurs we’ve worked with over the past 25 years, as their vision and relentless execution has been our foundation. We look forward to backing entrepreneurs with our new fund that we believe will become the next generation of iconic companies, in this incredibly fertile technology industry.”']",Datastax,"['TCV', 'NavigationClose', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Bryce Durbin', 'TCV', 'Airbnb', 'Spotify', 'TCV', 'John Doran', 'TCV', 'VC', 'TCV XI', 'Julia Roux', 'TCV', 'TCV', 'Doran', 'TCV', 'IPO.Other', 'Mollie', 'Revolut', 'Nubank', 'Mambu', 'Strava', 'Genesys', 'Silver Peak', 'Jay Hoag', 'TCV', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/xWBOnYOe8K,2021-01-27T13:10:26,Playvox scores $25M investment and acquires Australian startup Agyle Time,"['It’s not every day you see a Latin American startup funded by a U.S. venture capital firm based in the midwest. Playvox, a Colombian startup that wants to bring a positive twist to customer service monitoring announced a $25 million investment from Five Elms Capital, a Kansas City, MO VC firm. It has now raised $34 million.While it was at it, Playvox also announced something else unusual for an early stage company: an acquisition. The startup bought an Australian company called Agyle Time, a workforce monitoring SaaS tool. The acquisition brings together two companies with similar missions to provide a more complete customer service solution.Playvox founder and CEO Oscar Giraldo founded the company in 2012 and has been quietly building it into an international business with brand name customers like Dropbox, Electronic Arts and Wish. The company’s Workforce Optimization platform works as a layer on top of customer service center management tools like Zendesk and Salesforce Service Cloud, allowing management to monitor digital channels and give customer service agents feedback to help them do their jobs better.“When you call a contact center or a company, you may hear that ‘this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes’. So Playvox is a technology that works on the backend of [the customer service system] to manage the workforce that is responsible for providing a great customer experience,” Giraldo explained. It does this, but instead of for calls, it focuses on chat and email interactions.Giraldo got the idea for the business nine years ago when he was working as a software engineer in Argentina and toured some customer service centers, where he observed a lot of disgruntled and unhappy employees. He wanted to start a company that would help give feedback to these employees in a more constructive and positive way.“Instead of the traditional approach of customer service QA that was punishing the agents [for mistakes], what we do is we use that data to train them with a learning management system that is integrated in the platform, and have coaching tools that allow our customers to provide timely feedback to the agent so they can change their behavior for the better,” he said.Customer support startup Gorgias raises $25MThe Agyle Time acquisition enables the company to expand beyond this feedback system into customer service workforce scheduling and position them to compete in the enterprise market with a more complete toolset. “What we see is that combining the quality management agent optimization tools that Playvox has built with Agyle Time’s workforce management will allow us to be a unique vendor in the marketplace,” Giraldo said.As for Five Elms, it’s a firm that invests between $4 and $40 million in companies that have between $2 and $20 million in revenue. They like SaaS companies in atypical places with portfolio companies in Fayetteville, AK, Columbus, OH and Brisbane Australia. Playvox fits nicely in that group.“Playvox continues to deliver extraordinary products, add renowned brands to its customer base, and attract exceptional executives because of its company values and culture,” Ryan Mandl, managing director at Five Elms Capital said in a statement.Glia raises $78M for its integrated, hands-on, AI-based customer service platform']",Prime Movers Lab,"['Playvox', 'Agyle Time |', 'NavigationClose', 'Playvox', 'Playvox', 'Five Elms Capital', 'MO VC', 'Playvox', 'Agyle Time', 'Playvox', 'Oscar Giraldo', 'Dropbox', 'Wish', 'Workforce Optimization', 'Playvox', 'Giraldo', 'Giraldo', 'Gorgias', 'Time', 'Playvox', 'Agyle Time’s', 'Giraldo', 'Brisbane Australia', 'Playvox', 'Ryan Mandl', 'Five Elms Capital', 'Glia', 'AI', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkCopy Share', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsCloudFundings & ExitsM&ARecent', 'TimeCustomer', 'Playvox', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/AaqmhqubET,2021-01-27T13:00:20,Datastax acquires Kesque as it gets into data streaming,"['Datastax, the company best known for commercializing the open-source Apache Cassandra database, is moving beyond databases. As the company announced today, it has acquired Kesque, a cloud messaging service.The Kesque team built its service on top of the Apache Pulsar messaging and streaming project. Datastax has now taken that team’s knowledge in this area and, combined with its own expertise, is launching its own Pulsar-based streaming platform by the name of Datastax Luna Streaming, which is now generally available.This move comes right as Datastax is also now, for the first time, announcing that it is cash-flow positive and profitable, as the company’s chief product officer, Ed Anuff, told me. “We are at over $150 million in [annual recurring revenue]. We are cash-flow positive and we are profitable,” he told me. This marks the first time the company is publically announcing this data. In addition, the company also today revealed that about 20 percent of its annual contract value is now for DataStax Astra, its managed multi-cloud Cassandra service and that the number of self-service Asta subscribers has more than doubled from Q3 to Q4.The launch of Luna Streaming now gives the 10-year-old company a new area to expand into — and one that has some obvious adjacencies with its existing product portfolio.“We looked at how a lot of developers are building on top of Cassandra,” Anuff, who joined Datastax after leaving Google Cloud last year, said. “What they’re doing is, they’re addressing what people call ‘data-in-motion’ use cases. They have huge amounts of data that are coming in, huge amounts of data that are going out — and they’re typically looking at doing something with streaming in conjunction with that. As we’ve gone in and asked, “What’s next for Datastax?,’ streaming is going to be a big part of that.”Given Datastax’s open-source roots, it’s no surprise the team decided to build its service on another open-source project and acquire an open-source company to help it do so. Anuff noted that while there has been a lot of hype around streaming and Apache Kafka, a cloud-native solution like Pulsar seemed like the better solution for the company. Pulsar was originally developed at Yahoo! (which, full disclosure, belongs to the same Verizon Media Group family as TechCrunch) and even before acquiring Kesque, Datastax already used Pulsar to build its Astra platform. Other Pulsar users include Yahoo, Tencent, Nutanix and Splunk.“What we saw was that when you go and look at doing streaming in a scale-out way, that Kafka isn’t the only approach. We looked at it, and we liked the Pulsar architecture, we like what’s going on, we like the community — and remember, we’re a company that grew up in the Apache open-source community — we said, ‘okay, we think that it’s got all the right underpinnings, let’s go and get involved in that,” Anuff said. And in the process of doing so, the team came across Kesque founder Chris Bartholomew and eventually decided to acquire his company.The new Luna Streaming offering will be what Datastax calls a “subscription to success with Apache Pulsar.’ It will include a free, production-ready distribution of Pulsar and an optional, SLA-backed subscription tier with enterprise support.Unsurprisingly, Datastax also plans to remain active in the Pulsar community. The team is already making code contributions, but Anuff also stressed that Datastax is helping out with scalability testing. “This is one of the things that we learned in our participation in the Apache Cassandra project,” Anuff said. “A lot of what these projects need is folks coming in doing testing, helping with deployments, supporting users. Our goal is to be a great participant in the community.”']",DriveNets,"['Datastax', 'Kesque', 'NavigationClose ScreenDatastax', 'Kesque', 'Henrik Sorensen', 'Getty ImagesDatastax', 'Kesque', 'Kesque', 'the Apache Pulsar', 'Datastax', 'Datastax Luna Streaming', 'Datastax', 'Ed Anuff', 'DataStax Astra', 'Cassandra', 'Asta', 'Q3', 'Q4.The', 'Luna Streaming', 'Cassandra', 'Anuff', 'Datastax', 'Datastax', 'Datastax’s', 'Anuff', 'Verizon Media Group', 'Kesque', 'Datastax', 'Pulsar', 'Pulsar', 'Yahoo, Tencent', 'Nutanix', 'Kafka', 'Anuff', 'Kesque', 'Chris Bartholomew', 'Luna Streaming', 'Datastax', 'Apache Pulsar', 'SLA', 'Datastax', 'Anuff', 'Datastax', 'Anuff', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Kesque', 'Kesque', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/ya5HGaIqGW,2021-01-27T12:30:54,Prime Movers Lab raises $245 million for second fund to invest in early stage science startups,"['After revealing its first fund just last year, a $100 million pool of investment capital dedicated to early stage startups focusing on sustainable food development, clean energy, health innovation and new space technologies, Prime Movers Lab is back with a second fund. Prime Movers Lab Fund II is larger, with $245 million committed, but it will pursue the same investment strategy, albeit with a plan to place more bets on more companies, with an expanded investment team to help manage the funds and portfolio.“There are a lot of VCs out there,” explained founder and general partner Dakin Sloss about the concept behind the fund. “But there aren’t many VCs that are focused exclusively on breakthrough science, or deep tech. Even though there are a couple, when you look at the proportion of capital, I think it’s something like less than 10% of capital is going to these types of companies. But if you look at what’s meaningful to the life of the average person over the next 30 years, these are all the companies that are important, whether it’s coronavirus vaccines or solar energy production, or feeding the planet through aquaponics. These are the things that are really meaningful to to making a better quality of life for most people.”Sloss told me that he sees part of the issue around why the proportion of capital dedicated to solving these significant problems is that it requires a lot of deep category knowledge to invest in correctly.“There’s not enough technical expertise in VC firms to choose winners intelligently, rather than ending up with the next Theranos or clean tech bubble,” he said. “So that’s the first thing I wanted to solve. I have a physics background, and I was able to bring together a team of partners that have really deeply technical backgrounds.”As referenced, Sloss himself has a degree from Stanford in Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy. He was a serial entrepreneur before starting the fund, having founded Tachyus, OpenGov and nonprofit California Common Sense. Other Partners on the team include systems engineer Dan Slomski, who previously worked on machine vision, electro-mechanical systems and developing a new multi-phase flow fluid analyzer; Amy Kruse, who holds a PhD in neuroscience and has served as an executive in defence technology and applied neuroscience companies; and Carly Anderson, a chemical engineer who has worked in biomedicine and oil & gas, and who has a PhD in chemical and biomolecular engineering. In addition to core partners with that kind of expertise, Prime Movers Lab enlists the help of venture partners and specialist advisors like former astronaut Chris Hadfield.Having individuals with deep field expertise on the core team, in addition to supplementing that with top-notch advisors, is definitely a competitive advantage, particularly when investing in the kinds of companies that Prime Movers Lab does early on in their development. There’s a perception that companies pursuing these kinds of hard tech problems aren’t necessarily as viable as a target for traditional venture funding, specifically because of the timelines for returns. Sloss says he believes that’s a misperception based on unfortunate past experience.“I think there are three big myths about breakthrough science or hard tech or deep tech,” he said. “That it takes longer, that it’s more capital intensive, and that it’s higher risk. And I think the reason those myths are out there is people invested in things like Theranos, and the clean tech bubble. But I think that there were fundamental mistakes made in how they underwrote risk of doing that.”Image Credits: MomentusTo avoid making those kinds of mistakes, Sloss says that Prime Movers Lab views prospective investments from the perspective of a “spectrum of risk,” which includes risk of the science itself (does the fundamental technology involve actually work), engineering risk (given the science works, can we make it something we can sell) and finally, commercialization or scaling risk (can we then make it and sell it at scale with economics that work). Sloss says that if you use this risk matrix to assess investments, and allocated funds to address primarily the engineering risk category, concerns around timeframes to return don’t really apply.He cites Primer Movers Lab’s Fund I portfolio, which includes space propulsion company Momentus, heading for an exit to the public markets via SPAC (the company’s Russian CEO actually just resigned in order to smooth the path for that, in fact), and notes that of the 15 companies that Fund I invested in, four are totally on a path to going public. That would put them much faster to an exit than is typical for early stage investment targets, and Sloss credits the very different approach most hard science startups take to IP development and capital.“The inflection points in these types of companies are actually I think faster to get to market, because they’ve spent years developing the IP, staying at relatively low or attractive valuations,” he said. “Then we can kind of come in, at that inflection point, and help them get ready to commercialize and scale up exponentially, to where other investors no longer have to underwrite the difference between science and engineering risk, they can just see it’s working and producing revenue.”Companies that fit this mold often come directly from academia, and keep the team small and focused while they’re figuring out the core scientific discovery or innovation that enables the business. A prime example of this in recent memory is Wingcopter, a German drone startup that developed and patented a technology for a tilt-wing rotor that changes the economics of electric autonomous drone flight. The startup just took its first significant startup investment after bootstrapping for four years, and the funds will indeed be used to help it accelerate engineering on a path towards high-volume production.While Wingcopter isn’t a Prime Movers Lab portfolio company, many of its investments fit the same mold. Boom Aerospace is currently working on building and flying its subscale demonstration aircraft to pave the way for a future supersonic airliner, while Axiom Space just announced the first crew of private tourists to the International Space Station who will fly on a SpaceX Falcon 9 for $50 million a piece. As long as you can prove the fundamentals are sound, allocating money turning it into something marketable seems like a logical strategy.For Prime Movers Lab’s Fund II, the plan is to invest in around 30 or so companies, roughly doubling the number of investments from Fund I. In addition to its partners with scientific expertise, the firm also includes Partners with skill sets including creative direction, industrial design, executive coaching and business acumen, and provides those services to its portfolio companies as value-add to help them supplement their technical innovations. Its Fund I portfolio includes Momentus and Axiom, as mentioned, as well as vertical farming startup Upward Farms, coronavirus vaccine startup Covaxx, and more.']",Booksy,"['NavigationClose', 'Dakin Sloss', 'VC', 'Theranos', 'Sloss', 'Stanford', 'Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy', 'Tachyus', 'OpenGov', 'Dan Slomski', 'Amy Kruse', 'Carly Anderson', 'Chris Hadfield', 'Sloss', 'Theranos', 'MomentusTo', 'Sloss', 'Sloss', 'Primer Movers Lab’s Fund', 'Momentus', 'Sloss', 'IP', 'Wingcopter', 'Wingcopter', 'Boom Aerospace', 'Axiom Space', 'the International Space Station', 'Prime Movers Lab’s Fund II', 'Fund I.', 'Momentus', 'Axiom', 'Covaxx', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/wTFHBFndwi,2021-01-27T12:10:25,DriveNets nabs $208M at a $1B+ valuation for its cloud-based alternative to network routers,"['People and businesses are relying on the internet to get things done more than ever before, an opportunity but also an infrastructure headache for service providers that need to scale quickly and reliably to meet that demand.Today, a startup that has built a clever, software-based way for them to expand their networks without buying costly equipment is announcing a major round of funding on the back of its business booming.DriveNets — which provides software-based routing solutions to service providers that run them as virtualized services over “white box” generic architecture — has closed $208 million in funding, a Series B that values the company at over $1 billion post-money.The plan will be to use the funding to continue building out the business internationally and to tailor it to more use cases beyond carriers, including the wave of bigger companies that stream large amounts of media and have some control over their networks as a result.Future deals are still under NDA, CEO Ido Susan said, but he described the opportunity as a clear one: “If you want to serve bandwidth with low latency, if you want to offer strong 5G capability or cloud gaming, you need to be close to your end customer.”The Series B is being\xa0D1 Capital Partners. Previous backers Bessemer Venture Partners and Pitango (which co-led DriveNets’ previous, $110 million round when it emerged from stealth) also made a significant investment, and Atreides Management also participated. This latest round was made at more than double DriveNets’ valuation in 2019.D1 has been an especially prolific investor in the last year, going big on businesses that are seeing a lot of attention as a result of pandemic conditions. They include e-commerce giants Warby Parker and Instacart, fintech TransferWise, gaming engine Unity, online car sales platform Cazoo, and transportation startup Bolt.DriveNets’ big round is based both on bigger trends in the market, as well as its own strong record.Before this round, DriveNets had already counted AT&T among its customers, a major vote of confidence for the company and its virtual network approach, but it seems that recent circumstances and the spike in internet activity have brought more providers to consider its approach.“The internet was growing 30%-40% annually even before Covid-19,” said Susan. “But even five years ago, incumbent carriers were coming to us saying, said no one can build virtual networks. Now, it’s not a question of whether it works or not, but when you will adopt it.”Recent momentum for the company’s sales, he said, is very good. “Everyone is working and studying from home so you need more capacity and bandwidth in the network,” he added.\xa0DriveNets’ core product is a more flexible and cost-effective replacement for the traditional network router that relies on virtualized architecture. Traditionally, routers have been sold as vertically-integrated hardware solutions, bringing together both software and hardware into one branded big box, with companies like Cisco and Juniper Networks dominating the space.In their place, as Susan and co-founder Hillel Kobrinsky envisioned it, DriveNets provides a solution that is based around generic white boxes. It currently works with three providers for these boxes, Susan said.These work in conjunction with a system it has developed called Network Cloud, which in turn runs a networking stack called the DriveNets Operating System. Service providers control their systems of white boxes and other servers through a virtualized service run over Docker containers, using open APIs to automate and configure various network services.This allows for more flexibility in capacity among the white box servers, but they can also be easily added and removed as needed. Essentially, it’s a system that disaggregates the software from the hardware, to make expanding the hardware much easier, and controlling the software significantly more flexible to boot.(Ironically, my conversation with Susan took place over Zoom with him in his home office, which also doubles as a DIY workshop. So with a full array of hardware equipment surrounding Susan, we talked about how software would come to dominate the world.)It’s a disruptive concept that potentially steps on a lot of toes, but Adam Fisher, a partner with Bessemer, said that he’s confident it’s one that will continue to gain traction.“We are extremely enthusiastic about the company,” he said. “Aside from Ido and Hillel as entrepreneurs, we really connected with their vision. Network routing is moving to software and cloud architecture. We’re talking not just about the small parts here but the\xa0hearts and lungs of the system.\xa0DriveNets is starting with the hardest parts. Once one customer becomes multiple customers, you just realise it’s the future.”']",Share on Twitter ,"['NavigationClose', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Yuichiro Chino', 'NDA', 'Ido Susan', 'Bessemer Venture Partners', 'Atreides Management', 'DriveNets', 'Parker', 'Instacart', 'Bolt', 'DriveNets', 'AT&T', 'Susan', 'Juniper Networks', 'Susan', 'Hillel Kobrinsky', 'DriveNets', 'Susan', 'Network Cloud', 'the DriveNets Operating System', 'Docker', 'Susan', 'DIY', 'Susan', 'Adam Fisher', 'Bessemer', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEnterprisecarriersDriveNetsNetworksroutingDriveNets', 'Lunden1:10', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The funding will be used for expansion plans across North America, expanding to new verticals, and acquiring complementary businesses.The Booksy app is used by customers to book and pay for beauty appointments with local businesses. Salons, nail bars and barbershops can manage the bookings, payments, and customer base via the accompanying Booksy Biz app. The platform also allows salons to sell other products via Booksy E-Commerce, which acts as a marketplace allowing customers to discover and book other local stylists, nail technicians etc.Booksy was founded by Polish entrepreneurs Stefan Batory (CEO) and Konrad Howard. Allowing customers to schedule their best appointment time means that 38% of customers end up booking after-hours and increasing their appointment frequency by 20%, says the company. The startup launched in 2014 but is now in the US (its largest market), UK, Poland, Spain, Brazil, and South Africa. It claims to be the number-one beauty booking app in each country, with “13 million” consumers on the app.Batory said in a statement: “Like with many sectors negatively hit by the pandemic, it’s been a turbulent time for the beauty and wellness industry but we’re confident in its ability to come back from this, so it’s fantastic to see our latest group of investors share our optimism and vision. This latest round of funding enables us to reach even more salons and service providers across the US, and in all the regions we operate, which in turn helps them reach more customers.”\xa0Alex Captain, founder and managing partner at Cat Rock Capital, said: “We are incredibly excited to invest in Booksy as it builds the leading global software platform for digitizing the beauty and wellness industry around the world.”Booksy certainly seems to have cracked the international expansion game ahead of most competitors, which tend to stay more local to their countries of origin such as Treatwell, Styleseat, Vagaro and Mindbody. The opportunity for Booksy is to now use its war cast to roll-up other local players.It has already acquired rival Lavito in 2018 and, more recently, merged with Versum in December 2020 allowing it to enter Mexico.']",Wheels,"['NavigationClose', 'Butcher@mikebutcher', 'Cat Rock Capital', 'Sprints Capital', 'OpenOcean', 'Piton Capital', 'VNV Global', 'Kai Hansen', 'Zach Coelius', 'Manta Ray Ventures', 'Booksy', 'Booksy Biz', 'Booksy E-Commerce', 'Booksy', 'Stefan Batory', 'Konrad Howard', 'Cat Rock Capital', 'Treatwell, Styleseat', 'Vagaro', 'Mindbody', 'Booksy', 'Versum', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Ray VenturesMexicomindbodynorth', 'CapitalBooksy', 'Butcher1:01', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/pIhbeFpsLy,2021-01-27T11:00:25,Lime adds shared electric mopeds to the mix,"['Lime is adding electric mopeds — painted in the company’s signature green — to its micromobility platform as the startup aims to own the spectrum of inner city travel from jaunts to the corner store to longer distance trips up to five miles.Lime said Wednesday it plans to launch as many as 600 electric mopeds on its platform this spring in Washington D.C. The company is also working with officials to pilot the mopeds in Paris. Eventually, the mopeds will be offered in a “handful of cities” over the next several months.The mopeds, supplied by manufacturer Niu, are designed for two people and outfitted with tech like infrared-cameras in the helmet compartment that can detect if they’re in use during a trip, an effort aimed at rooting out misuse and increasing safety. Repeat offenders of Lime’s policies, which includes wearing a helmet at all times, will be kicked off the platform. Customers will also be required to take a selfie wearing the helmet at the start of a ride.The helmets will be supplied by Moon for U.S. customers and Nikko for the European deployments.The mopeds will have a top speed of 28 miles an hour and be able to travel up to 87 miles on a single charge. Unlike Lime scooters, in which gig economy workers can earn money by collecting, charging and bringing back to city streets, the mopeds will have swappable batteries and be maintained by full-time employees.While it’s unclear if mopeds have always been part of Lime’s long-term plans, the company’s head of new mobility\xa0 told TechCrunch that they’ve been thinking about what the future of electrified urban transportation might include.“As we’ve grown as a company, we understood that we just needed to follow what our riders were demanding which is further distances,” said Sean Arroyo, head of new mobility at Lime. “The ability to meet any trip, at anytime, anywhere, is something that’s at the foundation for us and so our riders really are the ones that pointed us in this direction.”Lime CEO Wayne Ting first hinted late last year that a “third mode” of transport beyond scooters and bikes was in the works for the first quarter of 2021 as well as the addition of third-party companies to its platform. Last year, Lime also started to include on its app Wheels-branded electric bikes in certain cities. Ting said, at the time, that users should expect more partnerships like these.The expansion into mopeds is the latest sign that Lime has managed to put some of its darker Covid-19-tainted times behind it. Lime\xa0underwent a round of layoffs\xa0in April, taking on capital from Uber\xa0the next month in a down-round that brought its valuation under the $1 billion mark. Lime paused most of its operations for a month during the early COVID-19 days.But it has since rebounded. Ting said in November that the company is both operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter and was on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs (EBIT), in 2021. It also had enough cash — or access to it — to expand into mopeds.The question is, ‘whether more modes are on the way?’Arroyo didn’t give specifics, but it does appear more is coming.“I think throughout this year you’re gonna see us really expand, not just with modes, but optionality,” Arroyo said. ” For us it’s really about having a platform that’s available for all these trips, and then we want to be able to provide optionality that makes sense for the riders. Shared is a huge component, but there’s a lot of different levels of what shared looks like; and throughout 2021, I think you’re gonna see us offer quite a few different options as our modes expand.”Lime touts a 2020 turnaround and 2021 profitability']",Gardin,"['Lime', 'NavigationClose', 'LimeLime', 'Lime', 'Lime’s', 'Moon', 'Nikko', 'Lime’s', 'Sean Arroyo', 'Lime', 'Wayne Ting', 'Lime', 'Ting', 'Lime', 'Uber', 'Lime', 'Ting', 'EBIT', 'way?’Arroyo', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

A number of angel investors are also investing, including Pratima Aiyagari, Gilad Engel, and Abdulaziz Alrashed.Founded in late 2019, Gardin’s mission, in the U.K. company’s own words, is to help everyone access high quality, nutritious food that is “good for you and for our planet”.Specifically, the startup is developing tech for farms based on its own “optical phenotyping” hardware and accompanying analytics software. The idea is to enable food producers to measure and monitor the nutritional value of food, from “seed to plate in a real world environment,” rather than a lab.“With deployment of Gardin’s OS, insight from our analytics will be delivered to help food producers optimise production, grow nutritious food, lower carbon footprint and reduce waste,” says founder and CEO Sumanta Talukdar. “At Gardin, we want to empower food producers to feed the world consciously, sustainably and nutritionally, as it should be”.Infarm raises $170M in equity and debt to continue building its ‘vertical farming’ networkTalukdar says he started the company after learning that the traditional food industry currently “does not, or cannot, quantifiably measure food nutrition and quality”. This has seen Gardin partner with some of the leading crop and plant physiologists, phenotyping experts and plant scientists to identify the key biochemical mechanisms in various crops related to plant physiology.“By designing hardware to specifically measure the signatures of these mechanisms, Gardin is able to quantify plant physiology and key compounds density with high fidelity (i.e. signal/noise ratio) at a cost similar to consumer electronics goods,” he explained. To achieve this, Gardin is employing a multispectral data fusion approach, using a suite of remote sensing and computer vision techniques to capture very specific data which is then “fused” to drive the analytics.To that end, Gardin has been designed to assist both traditional and CEA (controlled environment agriculture), with the ambitious aim to become the new “food production gold standard”.“Our full stack product is designed to run and optimise the entire growing environment running silently in the background like an OS i.e we are solving their problems, helping food producers grow higher quality food and reducing their operating costs and carbon footprint,” adds Talukdar.“We have also designed our platform so we can integrate with their existing architectures. To us, asking a producer in what is already an asset heavy industry to change or add to their system to make us fit, was folly”.In terms of traction, Talukdar says Gardin has already secured pilot trials that are ready to go live early this year with “key go-to-market clients. They include supermarket chains, food producers and vertical farms.']",Share on Twitter ,"['NavigationClose', 'GardinGardin', 'LDV Capital', 'MMC Ventures', 'Pratima Aiyagari', 'Gilad Engel', 'Gardin', 'Gardin’s OS', 'Sumanta Talukdar', 'Gardin', 'Infarm', 'Gardin', 'Gardin', 'Gardin', 'Gardin', 'CEA', 'Talukdar', 'Talukdar', 'Gardin', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropeFundings & ExitsStartupsTCGardinGardin', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/DsLd91m9EU,2021-01-27T07:14:58,Joanne Chen just became the first woman GP at Foundation Capital since founder Kathryn Gould,"['Joanne Chen just became the second female general partner in the history of the now 26-year-old, Silicon Valley venture firm, Foundation Capital.Were she still alive, Foundation’s founder, Kathryn Gould, would undoubtedly cheer the development.Known for her big personality, Gould first met Chen when Chen was an MBA student at the University of Chicago. Gould was recovering from a bout with cancer at the time, and after being introduced to Chen through one of Chen’s professors, she initially advised Chen not to go into venture. As Gould herself discovered early on, doors open more easily to men in the venture world, which is why she’d started her own firm in the first place.Yet, like Gould, being dissuaded only motivated Chen more. While she began her career as an engineer at Cisco, she was long interested in finance, jumping into a banking analyst role with Jeffries, then working as an associate with the capital advisory firm Probitas before cofounding a mobile gaming company she would later wind down.Indeed, grad school in Chicago — and meeting Gould — only reinforced for Chen how much she wanted to become a VC, and following stints at Formation 8 and Hyde Park Angels, she landed at Foundation in 2014. (Sadly, Gould passed away in 2015.)Chen has certainly brought a fresh perspective to a firm that features 10 investors altogether.Aside from being the only woman in the group, Chen has a strong point of view, for example, on the entrepreneurial potential of students from U.C. Berkeley, where she studied as an undergraduate. While the university is not nearly so organized as Stanford when it comes to minting founders, in her view it has just as much talent and, as a result, it’s a network into which she invests a lot of time and energy as an investor.Chen, who was born in China and grew up in Montreal, also spends a lot of time thinking about AI, both as an investor and also simply a person in the world. Her father, who received his PhD from the University of Montreal, went on to work at Bell Labs as a researcher, and her mother is a computer programmer and “DevOps person” who Chen routinely talks with about software tools. But their background isn’t so simple.Like many immigrants, her parents left China following the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, roughly a dozen years after the Cultural Revolution had ended — which also impacted her family. Because her grandfather helped architect a telecommunication network company in Shandong, he was persecuted by the Communist Party, stripped of all his responsibilities and, as an “intellectual,” says Chen, placed in a so-called reeducation camp. Meanwhile, his son (her father) wasn’t allowed to start college until he was 21, and it was only because he was a good student that he was invited abroad to attend graduate school.Today, her family’s experience combined with China’s use of artificial intelligence — including to track its Muslim minority — is top of mind for Chen in ways it may not be for someone with a lesser grasp of the lengths to which authoritarian regimes will go, and how quickly they can act.It’s why most of Chen’s work centers on understanding how AI, from how machines evolve from organizing activity to replacing humans (which will definitely happen, says Chen); to how to recognize and counter malicious applications of AI with AI (such as through recruiting software that screens out names and gender to eliminate human bias); and how to otherwise make sure that AI is used to improve our lives.Of course, Chen isn’t exactly alone in her interest in AI. Nearly every startup today incorporates — or says it does — AI into its offerings, from lending companies to startups that help remote teams work more effectively. And investors, including at Foundation, have funded many of them.Asked how she deals with competition for many of these deals, Chen says she moves fast when there’s a decision to be made. She engages with VPs of engineering and technical founders who share ideas through Slack communities and elsewhere. She also notes that Foundation provides capital to roughly 30 operators who write angel checks and help steer the firm’s attention to interesting deals.Mostly, suggests Chen, she focuses on whatever is not landing in her inbox — a lesson learned in part from Gould years ago.It’s easy to believe. As Gould once told this editor of the advice she gives to other VCs: “It not the calls you take. It’s the calls you make. Everyone is calling you with dumb startup ideas, and you can stay hugely busy sorting through that crap. My advice instead is to figure out who are the 10 to 20 smartest people you know and call them. One of them is always starting a company.”Update: an earlier version of this story reported that Chen’s family left China during the Cultural Revolution, but her parents left the country later in time, as currently reflected in the piece.']",retained ban on TikTok,"['Joanne Chen', 'Foundation Capital', 'Kathryn Gould', 'NavigationClose', 'Foundation Capital', 'Kathryn GouldConnie Loizos@cookie', 'CapitalJoanne Chen', 'Foundation Capital', 'Foundation’s', 'Kathryn Gould', 'Chen', 'Chen', 'the University of Chicago', 'Chen', 'Chen', 'Chen', 'Gould', 'Gould', 'Chen', 'Probitas', 'Gould', 'Chen', 'VC', 'Foundation', 'Gould', 'Chen', 'U.C.

This time, Logic Founders is going to focus on fintech startups exclusively. Camille Tyan (pictured above) is going to lead the new studio.Over the past ten years, eFounders has launched dozens of software-as-a-service companies trying to improve the way we work. Portfolio companies include Front, Aircall and Spendesk.Camille Tyan previously co-founded PayPlug, a payments company that was acquired by Natixis (Groupe BPCE). He plans to follow the eFounders model centered around a new vertical. Logic Founders will come up with ideas for new startups. It’ll recruit two co-founders and start working on the product for the first 12 to 18 months of the company.Ideally, the startup finds product-market fit and raises a seed round after this initial phase. The startup studio keeps a stake in the startup but it moves on so that it can focus on new projects.If you’ve been following eFounders closely, the startup studio has already worked on several fintech companies, such as Spendesk, Upflow, Multis and Swan. New fintech projects will likely fall under the Logic Founders umbrella.The studio says it will launch API-first financial products. It is riding the embedded finance trend — many believe financial products will be distributed by platforms that aren’t primarily focused on finance but could benefit from fintech features.

https://t.co/UwMfc17XAd,2021-01-27T06:08:57,ByteDance is cutting jobs in India amid prolonged TikTok ban,"['Chinese internet giant ByteDance has told employees in India that it is reducing the size of its team in the country after New Delhi retained ban on TikTok and other Chinese apps last week, said a source familiar with the matter and an internal memo obtained by TechCrunch. After the publication of this story, a TikTok spokesperson confirmed the layoff.The company, which employs more than 2,000 people in India, shared the news with employees in the country at 10 am local time and said only critical jobs will be retained in the country, said the source. More than two-thirds of the company’s workforce is expected to be eliminated,\xa0the source said. ByteDance said it was left with no choice after the Indian government, which banned its marquee app late June last year, had offered no clear direction on when TikTok could make return in the nation, the source said on the condition of anonymity.“It is deeply regretful that after supporting our 2000+ employees in India for more than half a year, we have no choice but to scale back the size of our workforce. We look forward to receiving the opportunity to relaunch TikTok and support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers in India,” a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch.Prior to the ban, India was the biggest international market for TikTok, which had amassed over 200 million monthly active users in the world’s second largest internet market. India blocked over 200 apps with links to China last year amid geopolitical tension between the two nations. New Delhi has said that these apps engaged in activities that posed threats to “national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India.”Last week, New Delhi told ByteDance and dozens of other Chinese firms that it maintains the concerns it had originally charged against them and would retain the ban.TikTok CEO Vanessa Pappas and VP of Global Business Blake Chandlee shared more context about the move in a memo to India employees today. “We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived, and that we would be able to resolve this quickly. Seven months later, we find that has not been the case. Many of you have patiently waited to hear how this would play out, which has been very stressful. Thank you for your continued belief and trust in us,” they wrote.“As you can imagine, a decision of this magnitude is not easy. For the last several months, our management team has worked tirelessly to avoid having to separate anyone from the company. We’ve cut expenses, while still paying benefits. However, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational. We are fully aware of the impact that this decision has for all of our employees in India, and we empathize with our team.”Today’s move caps some of the strangest and confusing months for ByteDance employees in India. Following the ban, the employees were told to focus on developing a range of other apps from the Chinese giant such as the productivity suite Lark that had not been blocked in India.TikTok is engaging with India over ban and already complies with local privacy and security requirements, CEO saysBut they were asked to not talk about these apps in the public to avoid putting risk of other ByteDance properties also getting the limelight. The source said ByteDance also stopped all marketing efforts in India to promote its other services in the country.“While we don’t know when we will make a comeback in India, we are confident in our resilience, and desire to do so in times to come,” Pappas and Chandlee wrote in the memo.In a statement on Wednesday, Ji Rong, spokesperson of Chinese Embassy in India, said the nation’s ban on Chinese apps violates guidelines by the World Trade Organization. “These moves in violation of WTO non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of market economy severely damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. The Chinese side firmly opposes them.”“The Chinese government always asks Chinese companies to observe international rules and local laws and regulations when doing business overseas. The Indian government has the responsibility to follow WTO rules and market principles and protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors including Chinese companies. These moves of the Indian government have also hindered the improvement of the Indian business environment and the innovative development of related Indian industries. China-India economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial by nature. We urge the Indian side to immediately correct its discriminatory measures and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation.”']",its security update pages for iOS and iPadOS 14.4,"['TikTok', 'NavigationClose', 'TikTok', 'Bauer-Griffin/GC Images / Getty ImagesChinese', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'Vanessa Pappas', 'Lark', 'TikTok', 'ByteDance', 'Ji Rong', 'Chinese Embassy', 'the World Trade Organization', 'WTO', 'WTO', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'TikTok', 'Singh7:08 AM', 'TikTok', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Apple did not say if the attack was targeted against a small subset of users or if it was a wider attack. Apple granted anonymity to the individual who submitted the bug, the advisory said.Two of the bugs were found in WebKit, the browser engine that powers the Safari browser, and the Kernel, the core of the operating system. Some successful exploits use sets of vulnerabilities chained together, rather than a single flaw. It’s not uncommon for attackers to first target vulnerabilities in a device’s browsers as a way to get access to the underlying operating system.Apple said additional details would be available soon, but did not say when.It’s a rare admission by Apple, which prides itself on its security image, that its customers might be under active attack by hackers.In 2019, Google security researchers found a number of malicious websites laced with code that quietly hacked into victims’ iPhones. TechCrunch revealed that the attack was part of an operation, likely by the Chinese government, to spy on Uyghur Muslims. In response, Apple disputed some of Google’s findings in an equally rare public statement, for which Apple faced more criticism for underplaying the severity of the attack.Last month, internet watchdog Citizen Lab found dozens of journalists had their iPhones hacked with a previously unknown vulnerability to install spyware developed by Israel-based NSO Group.In the absence of details, iPhone and iPad users should update to iOS 14.4 as soon as possible.Dozens of journalists’ iPhones hacked with NSO ‘zero-click’ spyware, says Citizen Lab']",Daimler,"['Apple', 'Bryce Durbin', 'iPhones', 'iPads', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Safari', 'Kernel', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Google', 'iPhones', 'Apple', 'Google’s', 'Apple', 'Citizen Lab', 'iPhones', 'NSO Group', 'iPhone', 'iPad', 'iPhones', 'NSO', 'Citizen LabclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Whittaker9:29', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/YpuwPTAZg1,2021-01-27T00:27:55,Will this time be any different for Twitter?,"['As Twitter seems to buy its way into competing with Clubhouse and Substack, one wonders whether the beleaguered social media company is finally ready to move past its truly awful track record of seizing opportunities.Twitter’s pace of product ambition has certainly seemed to speed in the past several months, conveniently following shareholder action to oust CEO Jack Dorsey last year. They’ve finally rolled out their Stories product Fleets, they’ve embraced audio both in the traditional feed and with their beta Spaces feature, and they’ve taken some much-publicized steps to reign in disinformation and content moderation woes (though there’s still plenty to be done there).In the past few weeks, Twitter has also made some particularly interesting acquisitions. Today, it was announced that they were buying Revue, a newsletter management startup. Earlier this month, they bought Breaker, a podcasting service. Last month, they bought Squad, a social screen-sharing app.Twitter acquires newsletter platform RevueIt’s an aggressive turn that follows Twitter’s announcement that it will be shutting down Periscope, a live video app that was purchased and long-neglected by Twitter despite the fact that the company’s current product chief was its founder.TikTok’s wild 2020 success in fully realizing the broader vision for Vine, which Twitter shut down in 2017, seems to be a particularly embarrassing stain on the company’s history; it’s also the most crystallized example of Twitter shooting itself in the foot as a result of not embracing risk. And while Twitter was ahead of that curve and simply didn’t make it happen, Substack and Clubhouse are two prime examples of competitors which Twitter could have prevented from reaching their current stature if it had just been more aggressive in recognizing adjacent social market opportunities and sprung into action.I remember Vine, and I certainly remember Periscope :) You’re not wrong about our past. But challenge accepted on our ability to learn from our mistakes. A lot is different now.— Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) January 26, 2021It’s particularly hard to reckon in the shadow of Facebook’s ever-swelling isolation. Once the eager enemy of any social upstart, Facebook finds itself desperately complicated by global politics and antitrust woes in a way that may never strike it down, but have seemed to slow its maneuverability. A startup like Clubhouse may once seemed like a prime acquisition target, but it’s too complicated of a purchase for Facebook to even attempt in 2021, leaving Twitter a potential competitor that could scale to full size on its own.Twitter is a much smaller company than Facebook is, though it’s still plenty big. As the company aims to move beyond the 2020 US election that ate up so much of its attention and expand its ambitions, one of its most pertinent challenges will be reinvigorating a product culture to recognize opportunities and take on rising competitors — though another challenge might be getting its competition to take it seriously in the first place.General Motors announces the Bolt. https://t.co/UndFpsBDU5— Hamish McKenzie (@hamishmckenzie) January 26, 2021Twitter’s decentralized future']",raised $350 million,"['NavigationClose', 'Twitter?Lucas Matney@lucasmtny /', 'TechCrunchAs Twitter', 'Twitter’s', 'Jack Dorsey', 'Stories', 'Fleets', 'Breaker', 'Squad', 'RevueIt’s', 'Twitter’s', 'Periscope', 'Twitter', 'TikTok’s', 'Vine', 'Twitter', 'Twitter', 'Twitter', 'Vine', 'Periscope', 'Kayvon Beykpour', '@kayvz', 'Clubhouse', 'General Motors', 'Bolt', 'Hamish McKenzie', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsTCceocomputingFacebookjack', 'Twitter?Lucas Matney1:27 AM GMT+1•January', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/zy89MpRx7U,2021-01-26T23:28:04,Sila Nanotechnologies raises $590M to fund battery materials factory,"['Sila Nanotechnologies, a Silicon Valley battery materials company, has spent years developing technology designed to pack more energy into a cell at a lower cost — an end game that has helped it lock in partnerships with Amperex Technology Limited as well as automakers BMW and Daimler.Now, Sila Nano, flush with a fresh injection of capital that has pushed its valuation to $3.3 billion, is ready to bring its technology to the masses.The company, which was founded nearly a decade ago, said Tuesday it has raised $590 million in a Series F funding round led by Coatue with significant participation by funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. Existing investors 8VC, Bessemer Venture Partners, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Sutter Hill Ventures also participated in the round.Sila Nano plans to use the funds to hire another 100 people this year and begin to buildout a factory in North America capable of producing 100 gigawatt-hours of silicon-based anode material, which is used in batteries for the smartphone and automotive industries. While the company hasn’t revealed the location of the factory, it does have a timeline. Sila Nano said it plans to start production at the factory in 2024. Materials produced at the plant will be in electric vehicles by 2025, the company said.“It took eight years and 35,000 iterations to create a new battery chemistry, but that was just step one,” Sila Nano CEO and co-founder Gene Berdichevsky said in a statement. “For any new technology to make an impact in the real-world, it has to scale, which will cost billions of dollars. We know from our experience building our production lines in Alameda that investing in our next plant today will keep us on track to be powering cars and hundreds of millions of consumer devices by 2025.”The techA lithium-ion battery contains two electrodes. There’s an anode (negative) on one side and a cathode (positive) on the other. Typically, an electrolyte sits in the middle and acts as the courier, moving ions between the electrodes when charging and discharging. Graphite is commonly used as the anode in commercial lithium-ion batteries.Sila Nano has developed a silicon-based anode that replaces graphite in lithium-ion batteries. The critical detail is that the material was designed to take the place of graphite in without needing to change the battery manufacturing process or equipment.Sila Nano has been focused on silicon anode because the material can store a lot more lithium ions. Using a material that lets you pack in more lithium ions would theoretically allow you to increase the energy density — or the amount of energy that can be stored in a battery per its volume — of the cell. The upshot would be a cheaper battery that contains more energy in the same space.The opportunityIt’s a compelling product for automakers attempting to bring more electric vehicles to market. Nearly every global automaker has announced plans or is already producing a new batch of all-electric and plug-in electric vehicles, including Ford, GM, Daimler, BMW, Hyundai and Kia. Tesla continues to ramp up production of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles as a string of newcomers like Rivian prepare to bring their own EVs to market.In short: the demand of batteries is climbing; and automakers are looking for the next-generation tech that will give them a competitive edge.Battery production sat at about 20 GWh per year in 2010. Sila Nano expects it to jump to 2,000 GWh per year by 2030 and 30,000 GWh per year by 2050.Sila Nano started building the first production lines for its battery materials in 2018.

https://t.co/ZmhSaUisb1,2021-01-26T23:00:58,Apple just had its best quarter in India,"['When Apple reports its earnings on Wednesday, you can expect mentions of India on the call.Apple shipped more than 1.5 million iPhone units in India in the quarter that ended in December, up 100% year-on-year, making this its best quarter in the world’s largest smartphone market to date, according to research firms Counterpoint and CyberMedia Research.Thanks to the improved sales of older generation iPhone 11, iPhone XR, iPhone 12 and the newer iPhone SE, Apple doubled its market share in India to 4% in the quarter, the research firms said.Overall, Apple shipped more than 3.2 million iPhone units in India in 2020, up 60% year-on-year, Counterpoint said.The shipment growth comes months after Apple launched its online store in the country and offered customers a wide-range of financing and upgrade options, AppleCare+, and lucrative perks such as a free set of AirPods with the purchase of iPhone 11. The company plans to open its first physical retail store in the country later this year.For more than a decade, Apple has struggled to sell its handsets in India because of the expensive price tags they carry. Most smartphones that ship in India are priced between $100 to $200. Samsung, and a group of Chinese smartphone vendors including Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo flooded the market in the past decade with their affordable smartphones.None the less, in recent years Apple has visibly grown more interested in the country that is also one of the world’s fastest growing smartphones markets. The company’s contract manufacturers today locally assemble a range of iPhone models and some accessories — an effort the company kickstarted more than two years ago. (A recent violent event at an Indian facility of Wistron, one of Apple’s contract manufacturers, however, underscored some of the challenges Apple will grapple with as it looks to scale its local production efforts in the country.)That move has allowed Apple to lower prices of some older generation iPhone models in India, where for years the company has passed import duty charges to customers. The starting price of the iPhone 12 Pro Max is $1,781 in India, compared to $1,099 in the U.S. (Apple has yet to start locally assemble the iPhone 12 units.) The AirPods Pro, which sells at $249 in the U.S., was made available in India at $341 at the time of launch. AirPods Max, similarly, is priced at $815 in India, compared to $549 in the U.S. (It doesn’t help that an average person in India makes $2,000 a year.)Unlike most foreign firms that offer their products and services for free in India or at some of the world’s cheapest prices, Apple has focused entirely on a small fraction of the population that can afford to pay big bucks, Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at Convergence Catalyst, told TechCrunch.That’s not to say that Apple has not made some changes to its price strategy for India. The monthly cost of Apple Music is $1.35 in India, compared to $9.99 in the U.S. Its Apple One bundle, which includes Apple Music, TV+, Arcade and iCloud, costs $2.65 a month in India.']",Share on Twitter ,"['Apple', 'NavigationClose', 'IndiaManish Singh@refsrc /', 'Getty ImagesWhen Apple', 'Apple', 'iPhone', 'Counterpoint', 'CyberMedia Research', 'iPhone XR', 'iPhone', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'iPhone', 'Counterpoint', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Samsung', 'Xiaomi, Oppo', 'Apple', 'iPhone', 'Wistron', 'Apple’s', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'iPhone', 'Pro Max', 'Apple', 'AirPods Max', 'Apple', 'Jayanth Kolla', 'Convergence Catalyst', 'Apple', 'Apple Music', 'Apple', 'Apple Music', 'iCloud', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'iPhone', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Aa82T7IfO7,2021-01-26T22:27:52,ClassDojo’s second act comes with first profits,"['ClassDojo’s first eight years as an edtech consumer startup could look like failure: zero revenue; no paid users; and a team that hasn’t aggressively grown in years. But the company, which helps parents and teachers communicate about students, has raised tens of millions in venture capital from elite Silicon Valley investors including Y Combinator, GSV, SignalFire and General Catalyst over its life.If you ask co-founder Sam Chaudhary to explain how the startup survived so long without bringing in money, he responds simply: “When you have something that you think will be for the long term you can put [in] a lot of energy. So, we always kind of maintained the belief that like bringing people together and helping them be connected, especially last year when they needed to be apart, physically apart, was going to be really important.”In layman’s terms: ClassDojo has been playing the long-game in edtech since 2011, quietly aggregating free users-turned-fans across the world’s public schools, which are notoriously hard to sell due to tight budgets. Every engineer on the team serves a population that is the size of the city of San Francisco. The company has been intentionally frugal throughout the process. Its core service, which is an interface that allows parents and teachers to communicate updates and stay involved in the classroom, is free for anyone to download.“Our view from the start was actually that the idea of districts isn’t the customer of education, [that’s] kind of backwards,” he said. “It’s like Airbnb saying we’re going to transform travel by selling to hotels.” The route has helped ClassDojo gain traction with 51 million users across 180 countries.Two years ago, ClassDojo tested this customer love. It launched its first monetization attempt in 2019: Beyond School, a service that complements in-school learning with at-home tutorials. Within four months of launching the paid service, ClassDojo hit profitability. In 2020, the added dimension of COVID-19 helped ClassDojo triple its revenue and grow to have hundreds of thousands of paying subscribers.It’s a lesson in how a venture-backed startup can successfully live for years without any plans to monetize, grow a super-fan user base, and eventually turn those users into paying customers if the fit is right.The acceleration of ClassDojo’s business got noticed by Josh Buckley, the new CEO of Product Hunt and a solo capitalist.“For years, they’ve quietly been building the most adored brand in the industry; kids, teachers and families they serve love it. Their business model follows that vision; they’re focused on serving the consumers, not the ‘system’” Buckley said.Buckley led a new $30 million financing round for ClassDojo, he tells TechCrunch. The round also includes Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra, Coda CEO and former Youtube head of product and engineering Shishir Mehrotra, former product lead of growth for Airbnb Lenny Rachitsky, and others.The financing comes nearly two years after ClassDojo raised a $35 million Series C round led by GSV. When new capital is less than the preceding round it usually signals a downround, but Chaudhary says that ClassDojo had a “significant markup on valuation” with the extension round. The trend of opportunistic extension rounds has grown for edtech startups recently as the pandemic underscores the need for remote learning innovation.ClassDojo’s next actWith new financing and massive scale, ClassDojo is now trying to evolve from a communication app into a platform that can help students get better learning experiences beyond the one they get from schools.Chaudhary says that they plan to double ClassDojo’s 55-person team, invest in product, and enter new markets.“For me, I’d always thought ClassDojo could enable a better future, specifically one where kids’ outcomes aren’t entirely determined by what their ZIP code can offer them,” Chaudhary said. “That’s the kind of future we’ve been building toward.” He likened ClassDojo’s goal as similar to Netflix: provide a broad scope of material for a broad scope of people, not just on-demand political dramas.ClassDojo is already creating content around topics not discussed in school such as how to fail and how to become an empathetic person, as part of its Big Idea series. The Beyond School offering helps students set goals and track activities, as well as find activities such as dinner table discussion starters or bedtime meditations.Image Credits: ClassDojoClassDojo charges $7.99 a month, or $59.99 annually, for its premium content. The platform is finding small ways to add personalization and spice to its content, such as customized avatars, but further innovation will be key in making its next phase work.While ClassDojo certainly has a strong user engine to monetize off of, the content game is difficult to win at. Content, to an extent, is commoditized. If you can find a free tutorial on YouTube or Khan Academy, why buy a subscription to an edtech platform that offers the same solution? The commodification of education is good for end-users and is often why startups have a freemium model as a customer acquisition strategy. To convert free users into paying subscribers, edtech startups need to offer differentiated and targeted content.Booming edtech M&A activity brings consolidation to a fragmented sectorThe United States continues to be a dominant market for ClassDojo, which also has users in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and more. While some in edtech express concern that United States consistently lags in consumer spending in education, Chaudhary thinks it’s an unfair assessment.“To believe that, you have to believe that families don’t care all that much about their kids. And I just don’t think that’s true,” he said. “All the ways that American people express their care for children, there’s such a range, from extracurricular to sports camp to moving to the right zip code.”And with that mindset, ClassDojo thinks that it can become the brand that families turn to when they think about a child’s education.“I think there’s just like a missing brand in the world right now,” Chaudhary said. “There’s a blank, a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.”To win post-pandemic, edtech needs to start thinking big\xa0']",S’More,"['smartboy10/DigitalVision / Getty ImagesClassDojo’s', 'Y Combinator', 'GSV', 'SignalFire', 'General Catalyst', 'Sam Chaudhary', 'ClassDojo', 'Beyond School', 'Josh Buckley', 'Product Hunt', 'Buckley', 'Buckley', 'ClassDojo', 'Superhuman', 'Rahul Vohra', 'Coda', 'Youtube', 'Shishir Mehrotra', 'Lenny Rachitsky', 'ClassDojo', 'GSV', 'Chaudhary', 'ClassDojo', 'ClassDojo', 'ClassDojo', 'Beyond School', 'YouTube', 'Khan Academy', 'ClassDojo', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

I’d be set financially, the investors who had given us $70 million would make money, and the technology we created would get new legs in an organization with broader reach and resources.Still, I had regrets. For one thing, I initially hadn’t wanted to sell. (More on that later.) For another, I was nagged by the feeling that our company had fallen short of its true potential, and that the reason was me — specifically, several rookie mistakes I made as a first-time entrepreneur.I don’t stew about those errors any longer. In fact, I believe my miscues at my first startup will help define my career from here on out. That’s why, as I grow my next company, I’m thinking about not only the things I want to do but those I’d never do again.Here are five of them.Trying to do too much myselfIn management theory terms, I was a “pacesetter.” I’d be the first to jump into any project or task, I’d execute it as quickly as possible and I expected everyone else to keep up. I thought that was how a startup leader acted — super helpful and scrappy.But it came at a big price: disempowerment of the team. I was hoarding not only control — nobody felt like they personally owned anything — but also the institutional knowledge that needs to be spread around as a company grows.

Independent thinking suffered. \n\t\t\tI became a human GPS: People could follow my directions, but they struggled to find the way themselves.

Assuming that many people will choose the latter, the next question is: “How do you make discovery fun? There’s got to be multimedia, video, audio, games, all of those features are part of our product roadmap … S’More will feel like Hinge meets Nextdoor.” (Apparently, there’s “a huge cohort” of users on Nextdoor who are single and looking for relationships.)Image Credits: S’MoreThe new funding comes from a long list of investors: Benson Oak Ventures, Mark Pincus’ Workplay Ventures, Gaingels VC, Loud Capital/Pride Fund,\xa0SideCar Angels, AppLovin Chairman Rafael Vivas, Joshua Black of Apollo Management, Plus Grade CEO Ken Harris, Harvard geneticist George Church, former Meet Group CEO John Abbott, former IMAX CEO Brad Weschler, Aaron and Sharon Stern, Justen Stepka/Enterprise Fund, Boston Harbor Angels, Grit Daily CEO Jordan French, Kind.Fund founder Marty Isaac, Craig Mullett and Dating Group.Cohen-Asletai told me the funding has already allowed him to hire what he’s calling a “founding team,” including chief architect Long Nguyen, head of operations Sneha Ramanchandran, head of product and design Regina Guinto and senior developer David Lichy.S’More is also announcing that it has signed a production deal with producers Elvia Van Es Oliva and Jack Tarantino, who have worked on shows like “90 Day Fiancé.” Cohen-Asletai said the startup will work with them to create “anti-superficial” dating content for digital platforms and TV networks.This deal builds on the success of S’More Live, the startup’s celebrity dating show on Instagram Live, which has aired 60 episodes so far.“We’re using that show to build our brand, to gain awareness and then …\xa0we’re actually able to leverage all of the viewers and retarget them with content from S’More, which has made our cost to acquire a user [very affordable],” Cohen-Asletai said.S’More is a new dating app that looks to suspend physical attraction for something more']",submit their pitch decks right here!,"['NavigationClose', 'Adam Cohen-Aslatei', 'Cohen-Aslatei', 'Cohen-Aslatei', 'Nextdoor', 'Benson Oak Ventures', 'Gaingels VC', 'Loud Capital/Pride Fund', 'AppLovin', 'Rafael Vivas', 'Joshua Black', 'Apollo Management, Plus Grade', 'Ken Harris', 'Harvard', 'George Church', 'Meet Group', 'John Abbott', 'Brad Weschler', 'Aaron', 'Sharon Stern', 'Justen Stepka/Enterprise Fund', 'Boston Harbor Angels', 'Grit Daily', 'Jordan French', 'Marty Isaac', 'Craig Mullett', 'Cohen-Asletai', 'Long Nguyen', 'Sneha Ramanchandran', 'David Lichy', 'Elvia Van Es Oliva', 'Jack Tarantino', 'Cohen-Asletai', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'aslateiBenson Oak VenturesDating Groupgeorge', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/L3pONuyxQ6,2021-01-26T19:39:21,"Sony tempts professionals with the top-shelf, top-tier Alpha 1","['Sony is making a play for the top end of the professional digital camera world, where videographers and sports photographers demand immaculate image quality at high resolutions in short order. The new Alpha 1 beats pretty much everything on the market on paper, but it’ll set you back a cool $6,500.This is, of course, well above the price range for ordinary consumers and even spendy enthusiasts and “prosumers.” It’s a professional tool, and in this range Canon has historically been the go-to with its 1D series, and more recently its R5, a full-frame mirrorless that leapfrogged the competition to great acclaim last year. But Sony clearly means to leapfrog the R5 in turn.The Canon R5 ticked all the right boxes: full frame sensor, 45 megapixels at 20 frames per second, an excellent EVF, in-body image stabilization, and 8K video. Sony ticks them all too… but harder.Image Credits: SonyThe Alpha 1 will send down its 50 megapixel stills at 30 frames per second and with no viewfinder blackout (plus the backside-illuminated sensor will be more sensitive); its EVF has nearly twice the pixels and can refresh twice as fast, 240 fps; its 8K video is born at a higher resolution (the Sony uses the full 8.6K and downrezzes); it’ll shoot for half an hour without overheating (an R5 quirk); and so on and so forth.Sony seems to have deliberately outdone Canon’s flagship in every way possible, though with no consideration for cost: the R5 goes for about $3800, while the A1 is $6500.Yet photographers are no strangers to spending that kind of cash on a tool of the trade (a lens can run you as much or more). Anyone who shoots sports or nature knows that 30 fps instead of 20 fps may mean the difference between getting a cover shot and nothing at all. Visual effects artists who work closely with footage peep pixels all day will be able to tell an R5 8K from an A1 8K. Will it matter? Maybe, maybe not. Would you take the risk or pay extra to eliminate it?Image Credits: SonyIf it’s merely a question of money to get the best instead of almost the best, there are a lot of people out there who will write that check without a second thought. Of course, the R5 was released half a year ago and its successor (the “Mark II”) may change that calculus again.To be clear, the R5 and A1 are both far more camera than most people will ever need. They’re the bleeding edge of the industry — an industry that has been shrinking steadily for years. Battling fiercely now over professionals may have long-lasting effects as bit players get edged out, unable to compete. It’s an investment in the markets that they think will last despite the constant creeping encroachment of smartphones.More importantly for the rest of us, competition like this in the camera industry is good because it produces advances that trickle down to the models we can actually afford. Not that anyone really needs 8K, but that improved sensor readout and EVF sure would be nice to have.You can read more about the Alpha 1’s specs here.']",Tweetbot 6,"['Sony', 'NavigationClose', 'ScreenSony', 'SonySony', 'Canon', 'Sony', 'EVF', 'Sony', 'EVF', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'A1', 'A1', 'A1', '8K', 'EVF', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/J1LqAV45kJ,2021-01-26T20:02:04,Tweetbot 6 released with new subscription pricing,"['Tapbots, the company behind Tweetbot, has released a major update for the iPhone and iPad. Tweetbot 6 is now available in the App store. While there aren’t a lot of visual changes, there are a couple of important things happening under the hood.First, Tweetbot 6 is using Twitter’s API v2. An API is an interface that lets two applications or services interact with each other. In today’s case, Tweetbot uses Twitter’s API to interact with the service.And third-party developers can only do what Twitter lets them do. For many years, Twitter’s API has been somewhat limited, especially if you’ve been trying to build a full-fledged Twitter client. But API v2 surfaces some missing features.For instance, Tweetbot 6 can now display polls. Before that, polls simply didn’t appear in the timeline. Similarly, Tweetbot 6 displays preview cards, which let you preview linked content without having to click on them. Some features are still missing, such as stories.There are some minor changes with Tweetbot 6, such as new interface themes, a new feature that lets you select Chrome or Firefox as browser options for links and some tweaks in the app design.The business model is changing as well. Instead of paying to download the app, you can now download a free app with many restrictions — for instance, you can’t tweet. When you’re ready, you can subscribe to unlock all features for $0.99 per month or $5.99 per year.This change should ensure the future of the app. Tapbots says Tweetbot 6 is currently in early access. The company plans to add more features down the road.And if you’re using Tweetbot 5 right now, the app is still working fine. You can re-download the app from the ‘Purchased’ section in the App Store.Twitter introduces a new, fully rebuilt developer API, launching next week']",received less than 5 percent ,"['NavigationClose', 'Tweetbot', 'iPhone', 'iPad', 'App', 'Tweetbot', 'Twitter’s', 'Tweetbot', 'Tweetbot', 'Chrome', 'Tweetbot 6', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Tweetbot', 'iPhone', 'iPad', 'App', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Among several improvements, we’re thrilled to ramp up the Pitch Deck Teardown.In short, folks can submit their pitch decks to get feedback from investors and founders alike.The importance of the pitch deck can’t be underestimated. It is often the first point of contact between a company and venture investors, but how investors consume a pitch deck (and what they really think) is also a bit of a black box.Are they speed-flipping through the slides or taking their time? Do they prefer more information on the team or context on the industry? More numbers or more words? How many slides is the right number of slides?There are too many questions to count, and often very few answers. But we’re popping the lid off of that black box with the Pitch Deck Teardown. We’ve done Pitch Deck Teardowns at events like Disrupt and Early Stage 2020, and this year we’re cranking it up a notch.Anyone can submit their pitch deck and hear what our guests, tech leaders across the industry, think of them.

https://t.co/jJoN7bAseX,2021-01-26T18:59:58,These investors want to back ‘ridiculously early’ female-led African startups,"['In 2019, female-led companies received less than 5 percent of the global venture capital. Bringing it to Africa, only 10 percent of the West African startups that cumulatively raised $1 million had at least one female co-founder in the past decade.There are many stats to back up the underrepresentation of women in starting a company, raising money and general involvement in technology where the global tech workforce comprises 28.8% women.In a male-dominated space, programs geared toward supporting female entrepreneurs have emerged to close the gap on all fronts. However, for those centered around female founders, most are quick to offer mentorship and training but tend to ignore the importance of raising money.FirstCheck Africa, a female-focused angel fund that launched yesterday, is hoping to address this challenge. According to the fund, “fixing capital access for female tech entrepreneurs in Africa needs an intentional, female-led approach.”FirstCheck Africa was founded by Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi. Omame is the MD of Endeavor Nigeria, a program for high-impact entrepreneurs, and Eweniyi is the co-founder and COO of Piggyvest, a Nigerian fintech startup.Omame’s experience working with founders and managing a VC firm (Amari Ventures) and Odunayo’s as a founder will prove vital to what FirstCheck Africa hopes to achieve: Making it easy for African women to raise capital and invest in tech.The fund will provide between $15,000 to $25,000 in six women this year in exchange for modest equity. FirstCheck Africa plans to see each woman or female-led team through the ideation stage to a significant pre-seed round within 12 months.\xa0\xa0“We know we can generate solid long-term returns by investing in women, so we’ll write female founders’ first checks and be their earliest believers. We’re not afraid to invest ridiculously early in great women,” an excerpt in the statement read.The fund also specifies that it is open to investing in mixed co-founder teams, with at least one woman. But the caveat is “only where it’s clear that the woman is a true partner and decision-maker, with a significant, equitable split of the founder equity.”Already, FirstCheck has received over 600 applications from African female-led startups, Omame told TechCrunch. But she iterates that while only six will be selected, FirstCheck is in no hurry to announce the deals when asked how soon the firm expects to write its first check.“We’ve been transparent with our investment goal as we’re backing up to six women-led, technology-driven businesses this year,” she said. “Outside that, there’s little interest from Odun or me to rush to announce deals. The work we’re doing is important and necessary, but it will take time.”When you think about it, backing six startups in its first year is an impressive goal. For context, Microtraction, an already established early-stage VC firm, invested in seven startups last year. To achieve that, FirstCheck will need to garner support from local and international investors that are intentional about closing the gender funding gap on the continent. Without providing specifics around how much the fund is looking to raise, Omame says this is already happening.That said, FirstCheck will be building a female-led investor community for women interested in backing startups by writing smaller checks. The notion behind this is to create opportunities for women around the continent to invest at more comfortable levels. And for African female entrepreneurs who need pre-seed and seed funding, the launch of FirstCheck is a plus to their selection pool. The firm now joins Rising Tide Africa and SA-based Dazzle Angels among others as one of the few angel funds targeted to African female-led startups.']",rolling out,"['NavigationClose', 'Kene-Okafor@ulonnaya', 'FirstCheck Africa', 'Odunayo Eweniyi', 'the MD of Endeavor Nigeria', 'Eweniyi', 'COO', 'Piggyvest', 'VC', 'Amari Ventures', 'Odunayo’s', 'FirstCheck Africa', 'FirstCheck Africa', 'FirstCheck', 'FirstCheck', 'VC', 'FirstCheck', 'Omame', 'FirstCheck', 'FirstCheck', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/HISbin6xvV,2021-01-26T19:14:28,Mealco raises $7M to launch new delivery-centric restaurants,"['Mealco, a startup promising to help chefs launch new restaurants designed around delivery, is announcing that it has raised $7 million in seed funding.It’s probably not news to anyone reading this that opening a restaurant can be an expensive, risky proposition — and of course, many restaurants have gone out of business during the pandemic.But founder and CEO Daniel Simon (who was previously a developer and product lead at Applicaster, and has also worked with Tel Aviv restaurant group R2M) said that even in the best of times, it can take $1 or $2 million to get started, and “if you want to hit the ground running, 98% of your focus is not on the food or the customers.”With Mealco, on the other hand, there’s no need to sign a lease or any other upfront costs for the chefs, and they get to focus on actually creating the dishes and the menu. Mealco locally sources the ingredients, which are then cooked using the startup’s kitchen infrastructure and offered for delivery via the standard delivery apps — Uber Eats, DoorDash, Postmates and Seamless.Simon said that with Mealco, the process of getting a new restaurant up and running only takes six to eight weeks: “We tell [the chefs] they don’t need to chop any more onions or tomatoes. There’s Mealco software that can tell employees at the Mealco kitchen how to prepare [each dish].”Cayenne. Image Credits: MealcoMealco also provides support around branding, marketing and social media, and gives chefs access to a dashboard with real-time data about menu performance and customer feedback, which can allow them to quickly make adjustments as needed. The chef, he said, can “manage the restaurant from their mobile phone.”The startup has already launched two restaurants delivering in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens — Mexican restaurant Tributo and Nashville hot chicken restaurant Cayenne (the latter with chef Hillary Sterling). And it says there are 50 chefs on the waitlist.Asked whether any of Mealco’s partners mind being separated from the food preparation and the dining experience, Simon said it depends on the chef.“If you want to open a single location and be in the kitchen every morning,” then he said Mealco isn’t for you. “That not wrong or right, it’s a preference … But most chefs are creators, they’re artists. They express themselves through food.” And in his view, Mealco allows them to focus on that creativity.Rucker Park Capital led the round with participation from FJLabs, Reshape, 2048.vc, Oceans Ventures, Wilshire Lane Partners and angel investors including former Seamless CEO Jonathan Zabusky. Simon said the plan is to launch throughout New York City and surrounding areas this year, before moving on to new cities next year.“We had the opportunity to see the evolution of the food ecosystem firsthand in the past few years,” said Wes Tang-Wymer, general partner at Rucker Park Capital, in a statement. “The time is ripe to embrace all these advances to launch new brands in a new format. In Mealco, we found the most compelling model to push the frontier of restaurant innovation further by empowering chefs to take ‘idea-to-table’ faster and cheaper than ever before.”JustKitchen is using cloud kitchens to create the next generation of restaurant franchising']",shut down Poly,"['Mealco', 'NavigationClose', 'Daniel Simon', 'R2M', 'Mealco', 'Uber Eats', 'DoorDash', 'Mealco', 'Mealco', 'Tributo', 'Cayenne', 'Hillary Sterling', 'Mealco’s', 'Mealco', 'Mealco', 'Rucker Park Capital', 'Reshape', 'Oceans Ventures', 'Wilshire Lane Partners', 'Jonathan Zabusky', 'Simon', 'Wes Tang-Wymer', 'Rucker Park Capital', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', '& ExitsStartupsTCMealco', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/LAaTXTdImI,2021-01-26T19:00:58,Twitter’s new API platform now opened to academic researchers,"['Twitter today is rolling out a new product track on its API platform, as part of its ongoing efforts to rebuild the Twitter API from the ground up. The track, which aims to serve the needs of the academic research community’s efforts, offers broader access to the Twitter archive and fewer restrictions on tweet retrievals, so researchers can access the entire history of the public conversation on Twitter’s platform.In addition to gaining access to all the Twitter API v2 endpoints released to date and elevated access, researchers will gain access to more precise filtering capabilities.Specifically, they’ll be able to access the full-archive search endpoint, which offers access to everything being said on Twitter. They can narrow searches for these historical tweets using start time and end time parameters.Image Credits: TwitterResearchers will also gain a significantly higher monthly cap on the number of tweets they can pull using the Twitter API v2. While on the Basic level of API access, this cap is set to 500,000. The Basic level of access on the Academic Research track is an initial monthly cap of up to 10 million tweets. This applies to the Recent Search, Filtered Stream, Full-archive search, and user tweet and mentions timelines endpoints, Twitter says.The Academic Research track will gain access to certain operators that aren’t otherwise available, too, with the goal of helping them pull more precise user data. Today, these include: $ (aka cashtag), bio, bio_name, bio_location, place, place_country, point_radius, bounding_box, -is:nullcast, has:cashtags and has:geo.\xa0Researchers can also add 1,000 concurrent rules when using the filter stream endpoint, instead of the limit of 25 available in the Standard track. Queries in the recent search endpoint can be 1,024 characters long, compared with 512 characters in the Standard track.Because of the elevated levels of access, those who want to gain access to the Academic Research product track have to first submit an application.All applicants have to either be a master’s student, doctoral candidate, post-doc, faculty or research-focused employee at an academic institution or university. They will also need to have a clearly defined research objective and must be able to detail their specific plans for how they intend to use, analyze and share Twitter data from their research.Plus, the data used from the Academic Research product track can’t be used for any commercial purposes, Twitter notes.Image Credits: TwitterAcademic researchers have been taking advantage of the Twitter API since its first introduction in 2006 and have used the data to study a variety of topics, Twitter says, like \u200bstate-backed efforts to disrupt the public conversation\u200b, \u200bfloods and climate change, \u200battitudes and perceptions about COVID-19\u200b\xa0and\u200b \u200befforts to promote healthy conversation online\u200b.However, the earlier version of the Twitter API didn’t make it easy for researchers to gain access to Twitter data — something the company wanted to correct with API v2.Twitter to date has catered to the research community in other ways, with additions like a website dedicated to academic research, updates to its developer policy to make it easier to reproduce and validate others’ research, and even special endpoints, like the COVID-19 stream endpoint released in April 2020. But it hasn’t fully thought through, until the API v2, how it could build tools that would actually aid researchers in doing their work, instead of the researchers having to figure out ways to work around Twitter’s limitations.The Academic Research product track was tested in private beta starting in Oct. 2020, and now this is being opened more broadly, where it will be made freely available.Twitter says it’s planning to add higher levels of access across all its product tracks in the future, including this one, in time. The later levels will help researchers who need even more data than what’s being offered with today’s launch. Twitter also noted it’s looking into adding flexible access as well, which would help account for times when developers were consuming more or less data throughout the year.Twitter acquires newsletter platform Revue']",Tula Mic,"['Twitter’s', 'NavigationClose ScreenTwitter’s', 'Twitter’s', 'TwitterResearchers', 'the Academic Research', 'the Recent Search, Filtered Stream', 'Twitter', 'The Academic Research', 'the Academic Research', 'Twitter', 'The Academic Research', 'Twitter', 'RevueclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Sq2LGxC4M2,2021-01-26T18:33:53,Google open sources Tilt Brush VR software as it shuts down internal development,"['As Facebook and Apple begin to fire up more projects in the AR/VR world, Google has spent the last year shutting down most of their existing projects in that space.Today, the folks at Google announced they had ended active development of Tilt Brush, a VR painting app that was one of virtual reality’s early hit pieces of software. The app allowed users to use virtual reality controllers as brushes to construct digital sculptures and environments.While the company will not be pushing any new updates to the app, they did announce that they will be open sourcing the code on github for developers to build their own experiences and customizations. Google also notes that the app will continue to be available in the app stores on VR headsets.“[W]e want to continue supporting the artists using Tilt Brush by putting it in your hands,”a blog post from Google reads. “This means open sourcing Tilt Brush, allowing everyone to learn how we built the project, and encouraging them to take it in directions that are near and dear to them.”Google acquired the small studio behind Tilt Brush called Skillman & Hackett back in 2015.Earlier this month, Tilt Brush co-creator Patrick Hackett announced he was leaving Google and would be joining the studio I-Illusions, the game studio behind VR title Space Pirate Trainer. According to LinkedIn, co-founder Drew Skillman stopped working on the VR project back in 2018 and now is part of the Stadia team at Google.Last month, Google shut down Poly, its 3D object library which allowed users to share digital art including design made in the Tilt Brush software.A Google spokesperson declined to comment further.Annddd here we go:https://t.co/dRfC5jR5YgTo some, this may look like the end of Tilt Brush.

https://t.co/lwcl6u3UuI,2021-01-26T18:17:07,The Tula Mic is a powerful portable recorder that doubles as a great USB-C microphone,"['Tula is a new company founded with the specific purpose of developing user-friendly hardware and software for sound capture, and its debut product, the Tula Mic, is now shipping after a successful crowdfunding campaign last year. Tula Mic is both a USB-C microphone input for computers and mobile devices, and also a dedicated recorder that has built-in storage and its own battery that can provide up to 14 hours of continuous use. It’s a strong intro offering that fits a lot of user needs at an attractive price point.BasicsThe Tula Mic is small — it’s definitely best described as “hand-held,” taking up roughly the size and surface area of a deck of cards. The physical design includes microphone capsules up top, with control buttons running along either side, and a USB-C charging port in the middle of the back of the hardware. The top-left side also features a standard 3.5mm port, which can be used not only for headphones for monitoring and playback, but also for input for lavalier microphones, effectively turning the Tula into a body pack.Just below the grill that contains the recording capsule, there are two lights on the face of the Tula Mic. These include a gain/peaking indicator and a recording indicator, providing you with simple but effective visual feedback. There’s 8 GB of built-in memory on board, and that built-in rechargeable battery offers up to 14 hours of continuous recording. Inside, there are not just one, but two recording capsules, including one with a cardioid recording pattern for capturing audio from one user speaking toward the mic, and one with an omni pickup pattern for recording room sound, best for events or interviews.The Tula Mic comes with a stand attached, which folds up and attaches magnetically to its midsection for easy transport. This is also removable and can be swapped out for a standard microphone-mount threaded attachment point. It’s a simple and elegant design that proves very handy in active use, but the proprietary mounting method here means that if you ever lose one or the other of these accessories, you can’t just pick up a generic one like you could if they’d used a standard tripod thread instead, for instance.Design and performanceImage Credits: Darrell EtheringtonThe Tula Mic’s design definitely conveys retro aesthetics, and its flat-sided oval shape is immediately eye-catching and recognizable. The unique look also provides great hand-holdability, and when used in stand mode, it’s immediately clear how a user should address the mic in use. The flip-down stand is elegant and keeps the mic firmly in place, thanks to its weighted metal construction.The controls located down either side of the Tula Mic are each labelled, but I found that I definitely had to repeatedly reference the included user guide before I could consistently remember what each of them did. The icons are helpful, but not necessarily immediately intuitive. It’s nice to have physical controls, however, rather than touch sensitive surfaces or a screen for input.The most important thing to note about the Tula Mic’s performance is that it sounds great, in both wired USB-C and standalone recorder mode. Having the ability to switch between omni and cardioid pickup patterns is also immensely useful in terms of the mic’s versatility as a one-size-fits-most solution, since you can use it for podcasting, for recording a class or lecture, and for recording a two-person interview all with equal ease and very high-quality results.Lastly, Tula includes a built-in local noise cancellation algorithm, which allows you to capture a brief recording of room tone in order to automatically remove it from your subsequent recording. It’s a very handy and surprisingly effective feature, and one that should provide big benefits in terms of later using recordings from the mic with transcription services like Otter.ai.Bottom lineAt $199, the Tula Mic is already priced to match many of the leading USB microphones on the market today.

Zero works directly with suppliers to sell food and other household items in jars, boxes and other types of sustainable packaging, and offers next-day delivery.Zero works with both big-name brands like Sightglass Coffee, Annie’s and Newman’s Own, as well as emerging vendors that are focused on sustainability, like Planet FWD, founded by Zume co-founder Julia Collins.Zero members pay $25 per month to access discounted prices on food along with free deliveries. Zero is also available without a subscription, but prices on individual items cost a bit more, and delivery costs $7.99.I’ve used Zero a couple of times and overall had a pleasant experience. The selection of food is pretty good, but I wasn’t able to find certain types of items like tortilla chips and mandarin oranges. On the plus side, Zero sells my favorite candy of all-time, Tony’s Chocolonely.In total, Zero founder and CEO Zuleyka Strasner says there are just over 1,100 different items available in the store.That’s partly because of the leg work that’s required to ensure the food manufactures are meeting Zero’s internal standards for packaging. In the case of chicken, Zero has worked directly with butchers to ensure they package it in compostable paper, which then goes into a compostable resealable bag, Strasner said. That took a lot of time, effort, energy and technology, she said.Zero does allow plastic at some point in the supply chain process but ensures that plastic is not passed on to consumers. Using chicken as an example again, the chicken starts at the farm and then must travel to one of Zero’s butcher networks and then to a facility to get packaged and processed.“So those farms and those parts of that transportation process do oftentimes involve plastic in there,” Strasner said. “And as the company grows, we get involved more and more and more into changing more and more of the processes and removing more and more of the plastic for each of our new manufacturing suppliers. So it’s always a journey for each farm, to start with that product going out to the customer plastic-free and then working backwards backwards backwards to removing more and more and more plastics.”While it would be ideal for all of Zero’s partners to operate fully plastic-free, Strasner said it was important to make it as easy as possible for farms, suppliers and other stakeholders to get on board, “rather than setting up a set of rules and regulations that say either you’re plastic-free from the minute the chicken gets slaughtered all the way to getting it to the customer,” she said.“That would not create the shift in the industry that we’re looking to create.”The idea for Zero started to come into fruition for Strasner\xa0during her honeymoon in the Corn Islands in Nicaragua. During her trip, she was shocked at how much single-use plastic washed up on the shore, she told TechCrunch. Meanwhile, she had seen the zero-waste, anti-plastic movement growing and began to wonder what would happen if she went plastic-free. Going plastic-free made her think more about the supply chain and how foods are packed in the country, she said.Given her background in technology, she began to think about how technology could be applied to the problem of plastic waste, “which must be solved within the next seven to 10 years,” she said. “Time is truly finite here and that’s the mission I decided to undertake.”Zero began testing in 2018 and officially launched in November 2019. The majority of Zero’s customers are members and, overall, the company has “many, many thousands of customers,” Strasner said.To date, Zero has raised $4.7 million in funding from investors like Precursor Ventures, Backstage Capital, 1984 and others.“We aim to be and we will be the largest sustainability platform in this country,” Strasner said. “So whatever you need and desire — food, homewares or otherwise, certainly plastic-free but also just sustainable in general — you would come to us. Zero really is a movement beyond just food.”\xa0']",interview with TechCrunch back in 2017,"['NavigationClose', 'Sightglass Coffee', 'Annie’s', 'Newman’s Own', 'Zume', 'Julia Collins', 'Zuleyka Strasner', 'Zero', 'Time', 'Zero', 'Precursor Ventures', 'Backstage Capital', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/YMTUGv4gCI,2021-01-26T17:52:11,Airbyte is an open-source data pipeline platform,"['If you’re working for a company that handles a ton of data, chances are your company is constantly moving data from applications, APIs and databases and sending it to a data warehouse or a data lake. There are a few well-known platforms to extract, load and transform data, such as Fivetran and Stitchdata.Airbyte is building an open-source data pipeline platform. An open-source alternative to Fivetran or Stitchdata is interesting because building and maintaining connectors require a ton of resources. If you’re just starting out with your data pipeline and you don’t have a big team, it creates a barrier to entry.Sure, existing data pipeline platforms already provide dozens of integrations with popular sources and destinations. Popular sources include Salesforce, Stripe, Marketo, SendGrid, etc. Popular destinations include Redshift, Snowflake and BigQuery.But there are a ton of small services that aren’t supported on traditional data pipeline platforms. If you can’t import all your data, you may only have a partial picture of your business.A lot of companies end up building custom connectors for their applications. With this open-source approach, Airbyte thinks it can foster a community of users to build and maintain thousands of open-source connectors. When a company builds a custom connector, another company can use it, improve it and give back to the community.“The open-source approach is the right approach,” co-founder and CEO Michel Tricot told me. “If somebody using a connector realizes that it’s broken, they can fix it for the entire community.”The team behind Airbyte originally started with a product focused on marketing data. They attended Y Combinator and later pivoted because of the coronavirus outbreak. “In a COVID world, there’s no marketing budget,” co-founder John Lafleur told me.Airbyte connectors run in Docker containers, which means they all operate independently from each other. You can schedule updates, refresh your connectors manually and monitor them individually.Right now, there are 46 connectors — Airbyte is currently working on certifying them to make sure they’re production-ready. 250 companies are currently using Airbyte.Ex-Uber team raises $6M seed for geospatial analytics platform Unfolded.ai']",Club Feast,"['Dillet@romaindillet', 'Samuel Sianipar', 'Fivetran', 'Salesforce, Stripe, Marketo', 'SendGrid', 'Redshift, Snowflake and BigQuery', 'Airbyte', 'Michel Tricot', 'Airbyte', 'John Lafleur', 'Docker', 'Airbyte', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsDeveloperEuropeStartupsAirbyteAirbyte', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/IkAyfXj38b,2021-01-26T17:42:00,The long road to the Qualtrics IPO,"['Speculation around the Qualtrics public offering is nothing new. All the way back in 2016, CEO Ryan Smith was dropping not-so-subtle hints about his intentions to file for IPO. After a decade bootstrapping, and growing to $50 million in annual revenue, the company was swayed into taking outside capital from Sequoia, and then again from Sequoia, Accel, and Insight Venture Partners.TechCrunch has written about the entire journey, and considering the unusual circumstances of the public offering paired with Qualtrics’ position outperforming its peer group, we thought it smart to take a look back at how the whole thing came together.2017After years of dodging the question, or offering up vague answers, Smith said the following in an interview with TechCrunch back in 2017:We know that there’s a huge opportunity here and we’re being very thoughtful about it because it’s not about going public. Going public is super easy to do. Just file the S-1 and we’re out,” Smith told [TechCrunch]. “It’s about being public and how that works and getting the house in order to make sure that that’s the case. We’re going to be a great public company. We’re going public.Is Qualtrics about to go public? A chat with founder Ryan Smith on the IPO questionJust a couple days later, literally, Qualtrics raised $180 million at a $2.5 billion valuation, again from Sequoia, Accel, and Insight Venture Partners. At the time, it was the biggest investment Accel had ever made. The growth of the company was staggering — the experience management startup had gone from $50 million in revenue in 2012 to $250 million in revenue in 2017.TechCrunch and many others speculated that the massive raise may not signal a delayed IPO, but rather a final financial push before listing on the public markets.Qualtrics waits on that IPO, raises $180 million at a $2.5 billion valuation insteadSmith was coy about whether that speculation was warranted:We raised the money because we can. An IPO isn’t an exit. It should be the beginning and we wouldn’t be going out if we didn’t think that more wealth could be created post-IPO.The company also launched its XM platform in 2017, an experience management platform that Smith implied would one day be as ubiquitous as Workday or Salesforce software in every office, but for managing internal feedback and helping organizations uncover key business drivers, predict future customer needs, and retain employees.Sequoia Capital partner Bryan Schreier said at the time:Qualtrics is an outlier. They have delivered outstanding, accelerating growth at nine-digit revenue numbers all while staying cash flow positive. That is practically unheard of. It’s an incredible sign of confidence in Qualtrics’ continued growth trajectory and the huge market for its new XM Platform that all of its investors have come back to buy as many shares as they could at this new valuation.2018In October of 2018, Qualtrics filed its S-1, which included third quarter results for the firm. Revenue was more than $100 million (up $8 million from the quarter before) and nearly 75 percent of that was gross profit. It was a strong quarterly performance and the perfect primer for a public offering.The original plan was to sell 20.5 million shares in its debut for $18 to $21, which would have grossed up to $495 million, putting its valuation between $3.9 billion and $4.5 billion.And then the unexpected happened.SAP swooped in with an $8 billion acquisition offer. An offer that Qualtrics did not refuse. Its public offering was delayed (or scrapped, depending on how you look at it) yet again.The idea was that SAP’s operational data combined with Qualtrics’ customer and user data would be a devastating blow to the competition and give the duo an unmatched level of power. Think Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram. Think Eye of Sauron.SAP CEO Bill McDermott said at the time:The legacy players who carried their ‘90s technology into the 21st century just got clobbered. We have made existing participants in the market extinct.If it wasn’t clear, he was talking about competitors like Oracle, Salesforce, Microsoft and IBM.SAP agrees to buy Qualtrics for $8B in cash, just before the survey software company’s IPOAs part of the acquisition announcement, Qualtrics offered yet another revenue update, saying it expected excess of $400 million in revenue for 2018 and a forward growth rate of more than 40 percent, synergies from the acquisition notwithstanding.2020Post-acquisition Qualtrics was a quieter Qualtrics, so we’ll skip past 2019 to 2020. Just 20 short months after being acquired, another twist in the plot: SAP announced it would spin out Qualtrics in a new IPO.Noting the company’s cloud growth had been in excess of 40 percent, SAP said the company would continue to be run by founder Ryan Smith and, interestingly, mentioned that Smith intends to be Qualtrics’ largest individual shareholder. SAP, of course, would retain majority ownership of the company.Though the announcement lacked much meat with its potatoes, it implied that Qualtrics could grow even more rapidly if not encircled by SAP’s corporate arms.SAP will spin out its $8B spin-in Qualtrics acquisitionThe spin-out strategy was a rare move for a company like SAP.As my colleague Danny Crichton wrote at the time:While private equity firms will take a company private and sometimes quickly turn it around in an IPO, it is rare to see a large company like SAP make such a dramatic last-minute bid for a company only to reverse that decision just months later.Here at TechCrunch we were excited about the impending IPO. Here was a company that had nearly gone public, now going public again.And just as the year was coming to a close, Qualtrics dropped its first (second, technically) S-1 filing. After digging through the numbers this was our takeaway from the data:Qualtrics is growing at over 30%, and after enduring some post-acquisition costs that appear at least partially related to how SAP handled equity compensation, is back to a more acceptable level of losses on a GAAP basis and is doing perfectly fine when we observe its adjusted (non-GAAP) results.As often happens when a company goes public while having a large corporate owners, Qualtrics’ accounting was harder to parse the second time around, but the bones of a nicely growing software company at scale were still there. How investors would value Utah’s giant was the next question.2021A few weeks later, Qualtrics dropped what would prove to be its first IPO pricing interval, targeting a range of $22 and $26 per share, giving the company a far larger value than it had targeted during its first run at the public markets.\xa0 Of course, Qualtrics was not only benefiting from its own growth and whatever boost it received from synergies with SAP, but also from frothy SaaS valuations and a frenetic public market.At that price, with 50 million shares up for grabs, the target raise was north of $1 billion. If that sounds high recall that Qualtrics posted a revenue run rate of around $800 million. The company’s growth has kept up as well, with the company’s Q4 2020 midpoint revenue expanding more than 23% compared to its Q4 2019 performance.All said and done, the S-1/A pegged Qualtrics’ early 2021 valuation at anywhere from $11.2 billion to $13.3 billion. Alex Wilhelm is much better at breaking down the numbers than me (or anyone, really) so I urge you to take a look at his coverage.A first look at Qualtrics’ IPO pricingWilhelm was also astute enough to recognize that the share pricing for Qualtrics’ IPO would likely be adjusted higher. And it was!Yesterday, Qualtrics raised its share price from $22 – $26 to between $27 and $29, putting the valuation range between $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion. Yowzah!New Qualtrics low-end IPO run rate multiple: 16.2x.New Qualtrics high-end IPO run rate multiple: 17.4x.Wilhelm noted that the Qualtrics share price may go up yet again, but also explained that while the multiples in play may feel low, it’s tough to be certain:Those do not seem to be particularly high multiples for Qualtrics, given recent market norms. However, trying to decipher the public market lately has been similar to reading the Rosetta Stone, but written in Wingdings. While on acid. So, you never know what is going to happen when a company starts to trade.Qualtrics raises IPO pricing ahead of debutThere is one thing we know for sure: Qualtrics has showed growth in revenue and more profitability than most software companies during its entire existence. We’ve been waiting for this IPO for years now, literally, and while many pieces of the puzzle are uncertain, we’ll get our answers soon enough.Unless of course some giant firm swoops in with a $20 billion acquisition offer.

https://t.co/5Ab1O5AP1p,2021-01-26T17:26:31,Club Feast raises $3.5M to help restaurants deliver meals that only cost $5.99,"['Club Feast, a startup with a more affordable approach to meal delivery, is announcing that it has raised $3.5 million in seed funding led by General Catalyst.The company was founded by Atallah Atallah, Ghazi Atallah and Chris Miao. The basic concept is pretty simple: Restaurant delivery that only costs $5.99 per dish — cheaper than almost anything you’d find on other delivery services. (The startup also charges diners a $2 delivery fee, as well as a $1 fee for single meal orders.)Atallah Atallah, who previously co-founded restaurant rewards company Seated and serves as Club Feast’s CEO, said the startup works with restaurants to select a few meals that they can afford to offer at the $5.99 price. Diners, meanwhile, sign up for a weekly meal plan and place their orders at least 24 hours ahead of time. The restaurant then knows exactly how much of a dish will be purchased, so they can plan ahead and cook in an efficient and economical way.“We really work with them to create a meal that they can make at a price that works for their users,” Atallah said. Plus, he noted that with all the orders placed ahead of time, Club Feast and its partners can plan the best routes without having to build sophisticated algorithms for optimizing on-demand deliveries: “Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones.”Club Feast CEO Atallah Atallah. Image Credits: Club FeastOf course, that requires more planning and upfront commitment from diners. However, Atallah noted that while meal credits are purchased via weekly subscription, they can be paused or spent at any time. He also suggested that he doesn’t see Club Feast as a direct competitor to on-demand food delivery — instead, he suggested that he continues to use DoorDash and Uber Eats for spur-of-the-moment orders or special occasions, while Club Feast is a more affordable option for regular meals.“With our price point, our average user orders eight times a month,” he said. “Why not make the pie much bigger?”Atallah added that Club Feast is diversifying the food options on the platform by adding side dishes and desserts. And it could eventually introduce higher prices for fancier meals, but he said, “We want to make sure that does not affect the $5.99 concept.”The startup currently makes deliveries in San Francisco and San Mateo, where it works with restaurants including The Halal Guys, Kasa Indian Eatery, HRD and Kitava. With the new funding, it plans to expand throughout the Bay Area and into New York City.“The pandemic exposed significant gaps in the food delivery industry, and we’re proud to support Club Feast on their mission to make the experience more affordable for both restaurants and consumers,” said General Catalyst Managing Director Niko Bonatsos in a statement.Restaurant rewards booking app Seated nabs $30M, acquires VenueBook to add events']",Plex,"['NavigationClose', 'KitavaClub Feast', 'General Catalyst', 'Atallah Atallah', 'Ghazi Atallah', 'Chris Miao', 'Diners', 'Atallah', 'DoorDash', 'Uber Eats', 'Kasa Indian Eatery', 'HRD', 'Kitava', 'Catalyst', 'Niko Bonatsos', 'Seated', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Catalystmealniko', 'Feast', 'General Catalyst', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/yeDHgqvxzl,2021-01-26T17:00:48,"Plex launches a subscription-based retro game streaming service, ‘Plex Arcade’","['Plex, the media software maker that’s expanded into streaming in recent years, is adding to its service once again with today’s launch of game streaming. Unlike other game streaming efforts from companies like Microsoft or Google, the new “Plex Arcade” isn’t focused on top gaming titles and new releases, but rather on retro games. At launch, the service is offering around 30 games, including titles like Asteroids, Centipede, Missile Command, Adventure and Ninja Golf.The game streaming service was spun out of Plex’s in-house incubator, Plex Labs, and represents more of a passion project for the company, rather than some larger shift in direction, we’re told. The technology to make it available was already 95% built, so the team decided to put together the game streaming service as a surprise for users, as well as a way to expand Plex’s core mission of becoming a broader entertainment platform.The company says it actually kicked around the idea of adding games to Plex for years, but over the course of 2020 in particular, the team was drawn to the idea even more out of personal interest and a need for a distraction.Image Credits: PlexThe game service was built with the help of new partner Parsec and its underlying, low-latency streaming technology, Plex says. This made it possible to bring fully playable game libraries to Plex.To build the game library, Plex partnered with Atari to license a catalog of classic titles.At launch, the full list of games include: 3D Tic-Tac-Toe, Adventure, Alien Brigade, Aquaventure, Asteroids, Avalanche, Basketbrawl, Centipede, Combat, Dark Chambers, Desert Falcon, Fatal Run, Food Fight (Charley Chuck’s), Gravitar, Haunted House, Human Cannonball, Lunar Battle, Lunar Lander, Major Havoc, Millipede, Missile Command, Motor Psycho, Ninja Golf, Outlaw, Planet Smashers, Radar Lock, Sky Diver, Sky Raider, Solaris and Super Breakout.Due to the partnership and licensing fees involved with the project, Plex Arcade will not be a free addition.Instead, it will be offered as a separate subscription for $2.99 per month for existing Plex Pass subscribers (Plex’s existing $4.99/mo plan). For nonsubscribers, Plex Arcade is $4.99 per month. A free, 7-day trial is also available.Plex Arcade’s server will require either a Windows or Mac to run (due to Parsec’s limitations), which means it won’t work on Linux, NAS devices or NVIDIA Shield. Gameplay, meanwhile, is restricted to iOS, Android (mobile or TV), tvOS and the Chrome web browser.It will also support Bluetooth and USB game controllers that are compatible with your device, or you can use a keyboard for Chrome-based gaming. Plex recommends the Sony DualShock 4 or Xbox One controller for the best results.Image Credits: PlexThe company is taking a wait-and-see approach to expanding the service over time.

https://t.co/Zr5giCARf5,2021-01-26T16:58:06,Nomad’s charcoal grill suitcase is modern ingenuity combined with classic cooking,"['Dallas-based Nomad set out to take an age-old cooking method and modernize it — but not by introducing connected or smart features. Instead, the Nomad Grill & Smoker takes classic charcoal grilling and relies on clever industrial design to make it packable and portable, while making sure cooks of all expertise levels can make great-tasting food even if they’re cooking with charcoal for the first time.BasicsNomad’s grill looks like some kind of fancy protective case that you’d expect to see traveling with a film crew, crossed with maybe a modern Mac Pro. It has an anodized aluminum build that uses a unibody casting in manufacturing, with high external durability and internal heat retention. It measures roughly 2 feet by 2 feet and is around 9.5 inches tall when closed, with a total weight of 28 lbs. including the cast stainless steel grill grate that’s included in the basic package.28 lbs. may seem like a lot, but it’s remarkably light for the cooking surface you get with the Nomad, which adds up to either 212 square inches of space in single-grate closed mode (good for smoking) or up to 425 square inches in open-grill mode, which can double the cooking surface with the purchase of an optional second grate and charcoal placed in either side (better for open-flame BBQing).The case features a strong and durable dual-latch closure system and a reinforced handle for toting it around. Silicon skids offer protection for surfaces when laying the grill down to cook and there are two magnetic air vents on either side for controlling airflow and flame, which are adjusted simply by manually sliding.Design and performanceImage Credits: NomadThe Nomad design is deceptively simple — at heart it’s essentially a metal box. But looking below the surface a bit, it actually hides some very advanced construction, including a layered shell design that means the outside never actually gets too hot, which is great not only for chef safety but also for setting it down on a wide range of materials during the actual cooking process. For a portable grill, that’s a huge benefit.Looking at the grill grate specifically, it features a honeycomb design that helps better distribute the heat, which is also domed subtly to allow more clearance for the charcoal underneath. It’s removable, but also snaps into place in the grill itself using magnets, which is great for transport and also for ensuring things don’t move around with any bumps.One other huge benefit that seems like a small thing at first glance is a built-in thermometer that’s molded into the case. This provides you easy, clear temperature readings for the grill, and it’s analog so there’s no power required — another big benefit for portability.In practice, the grill works exactly as you’d expect a great charcoal grill to work, which is amazing given its size and portability. It should definitely be mentioned that you’re going to be much happier getting the grill lit if you pick yourself up a charcoal chimney, which eases the lighting process — but that’s a great accessory regardless of what kind of charcoal grill you’re using.Image Credits: NomadI was particularly impressed by the Nomad grill’s performance when it comes to smoking. It maintains an even and consistent temperature with the box closed, and it’s easy to moderate the temperature with the built-in vents if you need to adjust the cooking intensity. The proximity of the charcoal to the food also imbues it with great flavor.Bottom lineThe Nomad Grill & Smoker is $599, which is a fairly high asking price, but it’s also unique in the market for the convenience it provides combined with the performance it offers. Whether at home or on road trips, Nomad is a wonderful addition to any home cook’s arsenal, and an all-in-one supplement that can replace even a dedicated, more fixed installation charcoal grill if that’s the way you want to go.Weber’s new Smart Grilling Hub uses June tech to make everyone a grillmaster']",Calendly,"['Nomad', 'NomadDallas', 'Nomad', 'the Nomad Grill & Smoker', 'Nomad', 'BBQing).The', 'Silicon', 'NomadThe', 'Nomad', 'Nomad', 'Smart Grilling Hub', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Nomad', 'the Nomad Grill & Smoker', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/DylT83OxhN,2021-01-26T16:48:43,How Atlanta’s Calendly turned a scheduling nightmare into a $3B startup,"['One big theme in tech right now is the rise of services to help us keep working through lockdowns, office closures, and other Covid-19 restrictions. The “future of work” — cloud services, communications, productivity apps — has become “the way we work now.” And companies that have identified ways to help with this are seeing a boom.Today comes news from a startup that has been a part of that trend: Calendly, a popular cloud-based service that people use to set up and confirm meeting times with others, has closed an investment of $350 million from OpenView Venture Partners and Iconiq.The funding round includes both primary and secondary money (slightly more of the latter than the former, from what I understand) and values the Atlanta-based startup at over $3 billion.Not bad for a company that before now had raised just $550,000, including the life savings of the founder and CEO, Tope Awotona, to initially get off the ground.Calendly is a freemium software-as-a-service, built around what is essentially a very simple piece of functionality.It’s a platform that provides a quick way to manage open spaces in your calendar for people to book appointments with you in those spaces, which then also books out the time in calendars like Google’s or Microsoft Outlook — with a growing number of tools to enhance that experience, including the ability to pay for a service in the event that your appointment is not a business meeting but, say, a yoga class. Pricing ranges from free (one calendar/one user/one event) to premium ($8/month) and pro ($12/month) for more calendars, events, integrations and features, with bigger packages for enterprises also available.Its growth, meanwhile, has to date been based mostly around a very organic strategy: Calendly invites become links to Calendly itself, so people who use it and like it can (and do) start to use it, too.The wide range of its use cases, and the virality of that growth strategy, have been winners. Calendly is already profitable, and it has been for years. And more recently, it has seen a boost, specifically in the last twelve months, as new Calendly users have emerged, as a result of how we are living.We may not be doing more traditional “business meetings” per week, but the number of meetings we now need to set up, has gone up.All of the serendipitous and impromptu encounters we used to have around an office, or a neighborhood coffee shop, or the park? Those are now scheduled. Teachers and students meeting for a remote lesson? Those also need invitations for online meetings.And so do sessions with therapists, virtual dinner parties, and even (where they can still happen) in-person meetings, which are often now happening with more timed precision and more record-keeping, to keep social distancing and potential contact tracing in better order.Currently, some 10 million of us are using Calendly for all of this on a monthly basis, with that number growing 1,180% last year. The army of business users from companies like Twilio, Zoom, and UCSF has been joined by teachers, contractors, entrepreneurs, and freelancers, the company says.The company last year made about $70 million annually in subscription revenues from its SaaS-based business model and seems confident that its aggregated revenues will not long from now get to $1 billion.So while the secondary funding is going towards giving liquidity to existing investors and early employees, Awotona said the plan will be to use the primary capital to invest in the company’s business.That will include building out its platform with more tools and integrations — it started with and still has a substantial R&D operation in Kiev, Ukraine — expanding its operations with more talent (it currently has around 200 employees and plans to double headcount), further business development and more.Two notable moves on that front are also being announced with the funding: Jeff Diana is coming on as chief people officer with a mission to double the company’s employee base. And Patrick Moran — formerly of Quip and New Relic — is joing as Calendly’s first chief revenue officer. Notably, both are based in San Francisco — not Atlanta.That focus for building in San Francisco is already a big change for Calendly. The startup, which is going on eight years old, has been somewhat off the radar for years.That is in part due to the fact that it raised very little money up to now (just $550,000 from a handful of investors that include OpenView, Atlanta Ventures, IncWell and Greenspring Associates).It’s also based in Atlanta, an increasingly notable city for technology startups and other companies but more often than not short on being credited for its heft in that department (SalesLoft, Amex-acquired Kabbage, OneTrust, Bakkt, and many others are based there, with others like Mailchimp also not too far away).And perhaps most of all, proactively courting publicity did not appear to be part of Calendly’s growth playbook.In fact, Calendly might have closed this big round quietly and continued to get on with business, were it not for a short Tweet last autumn that signaled the company raising money and shaping up to be a quiet giant.“The company’s capital efficiency and what @TopeAwotona has built deserve way more credit than they get,” it read. “Perhaps this will start to change that recognition.”After that short note on Twitter — flagged on TechCrunch’s internal message board — I made a guess at Awotona’s email, sent a note introducing myself, and waited to see if I would get a reply.I eventually did get a response, in the form of a short note agreeing to chat, with a Calendly link (naturally) to choose a time.(Thanks, unnamed TC writer, for never writing about Calendly when Tope originally pitched you years ago: you may have whet his appetite to respond to me.)In that first chat over Zoom, Awotona was nothing short of wary. After years of little or no attention, he was getting cold-contacted by me and it seems others, all of us suddenly interested in him and his company.“It’s been the bane of my life,” he said to me with a laugh about the calls he’s been getting.Part of me thinks it’s because it can be hard and distracting to balance responding to people, but it’s also because he works hard, and has always worked hard, so doesn’t understand what the new fuss is about.A lot of those calls have been from would-be investors.“It’s been exorbitant, the amount of interest Calendly has been getting, from backers of all shapes and sizes,” Blake Bartlett, a partner at OpenView, said to me in an interview.From what I understand, it’s had inbound interest from a number of strategic tech companies, as well as a long list of financial investors. That process eventually whittled down to just two backers, OpenView and Iconiq.From Lagos to fixing cash registersYet even putting the funding to one side, Calendly and Awotona himself have been a remarkable story up to now, one that champions immigrants as well as startup grit.Tope comes from Lagos, Nigeria, part of a large, middle class household. His mother had been the chief pharmacist for the Nigerian Central Bank, his father worked for Unilever.The family may have been comfortable, but growing up in Lagos, a city riven by economic disparity and crime, brought its share of tragedies. When he was 12, Awotona’s father was murdered in front of him during a carjacking. The family moved to the U.S. some time after that, and since then his mother has also passed away.A bright student who actually finished high school at 15, Awotona cut his teeth in the world of business first by studying it — his major at the University of Georgia was management information systems — and then working in it, with jobs after college including stints at IBM and EMC.But it seems Awotona was also an entrepreneur at heart — if one that initially was not prepared for the steps he needed to take to get something off the ground.He told me a story about what he describes as his “first foray into business” at age 18, which involved devising and patenting a new feature for cash registers, so that they could use optical character recognition to recognize which bills and coins were being used to make a payment, and dispense the right amount a customer might need as change.At the time, he was working at a pharmacy while studying and saw how often the change in the cash registers didn’t add up correctly, and this was his idea for how to fix it.He cold-contacted the leading cash register company at the time, NCR, with his idea. NCR was interested — really interested. It offered to send him up to Ohio, where it was headquartered then, to pitch the idea to the company directly, and maybe sell the patent in the process. Awotona, however, froze.“I was blown away,” he said, but also too surprised at how quickly things escalated. He turned down the offer, and ultimately let his patent application lapse. (Computer-vision-based scanning systems and automatic dispensers are, of course, a basic part nowadays of self-checkout systems, for those times when people pay in cash.)There were several other entrepreneurial attempts, none particularly successful and at times quite frustrating because of the grunt work involved just to speak to people, before his businesses themselves could even be considered.Eventually, it was the grunt work that started to catch Awotona’s attention.“What led me to create a scheduling product” — Awotona said, clear not to describe it as a calendaring service — “was my personal need. At the time I wasn’t looking to start a business. I just was trying to schedule a meeting, but it took way too many emails to get it done, and I became frustrated.“I decided that I was going to look for scheduling products that existed on the market that I could sign up for,” he continued, “but the problem I was facing at the time was I was trying to arrange meetings with, you know, 10 or 20 people. I was just looking for an easy way for us to easily share our availability and, you know, easily find a time that works for everybody.”He said he couldn’t really see anything that worked the way he wanted — the products either needed you to commit to a subscription right away (Calendly is freemium) or were geared at specific verticals such as beauty salons. All that eventually led to a recognition, he said, “that there was a big opportunity to solve that problem.”The building of the startup was partly done with engineers in Kiev — a drama in itself that pivoted at times on the political situation in Ukraine (you can read a great unfolding of that story here).In any case, it seems clear that he got beyond his early days of being unprepared to double down and take the plunge when the opportunity presented itself.As for what form his scheduling idea would take, Awotona says that he admired the new guard of cloud-based services like Dropbox and decided that he wanted Calendly to be built using “the Dropbox approach” — something that could be adopted and adapted by different kinds of users and usages.Simplicity in the frontend, strategy at the backendOn the surface, there is a simplicity to the company’s product: it’s basically about finding a time for two parties to meet. Awotona notes that behind the scenes the scheduling help Calendly provides is the key to what it might develop next.For example, there are now tools to help people prepare for meetings — specifically features like being able to, say, pay for something that’s been scheduled on Calendly in order to register. A future focus could well be more tools for following up on those meetings, and more ways to help people plan recurring individual or group events.One area where it seems Calendly does not want to dabble are those meetings themselves — that is, hosting meetings and videoconferencing itself.“What you don’t want is to start a world war three with Zoom,” Awotona joked. (In addition to becoming the very verb-ified definition of video conferencing, Zoom is also a customer of Calendly’s.)“We really see ourselves as a leading orchestration platform. What that means is that we really want to remain extensible and flexible. We want our users to bring their own best in class products,” he said. “We think about this in an agnostic way.”But in a technology world that usually defaults back to the power of platforms, that position is not without its challenges.“Calendly has a vision increasingly to be a central part of the meeting life cycle. What happens before, during and after the meeting. Historically, the obvious was before the meeting, but now it’s looking at integrations, automations and other things, so that it all magically happens. But moving into the rest of the lifecycle is a lot of opportunity but also many players,” admitted Bartlett, with others including older startups like X.ai and Doodle (owned by Swiss-based Tamedia) or newer entrants like Undock\xa0but also biggies like Google and Microsoft.“It will be an interesting task to see where there are opportunities to partner or build or buy to build out its competitive position.”You’ll notice that throughout this story I didn’t refer to Awotona’s position as a black founder — still very much a rarity among startups, and especially those valued at over $1 billion.That is partly because in my conversations with him, it emerged that he saw it as just another detail. Still, it is one that is brought up a lot, he said, and so he understands it is important for others.“I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about being black or not black,” he said. “It doesn’t change how I approach or built Calendly. I’m not incredibly conscious of my race or color, except for the last few years through he growth of Calendly. I find that more people approach me as a black tech founder, and that there are young black people who are inspired by the story.”That is something he hopes to build on in the near future, including in his home country.Pending pandemic chaos, he has plans to try to visit Nigeria later this year and to get more involved in the ecosystem in that country, I’m guessing as a mentor if not more.“I just know the country that produced me,” he said. “There are a million Topes in Nigeria. The difference for me was my parents. But I’m not a diamond in the rough, and I want to get involved in some way to help with that full potential.”']",a 2019 U.S. law,"['NavigationClose', 'Calendly', 'Getty ImagesOne', 'OpenView Venture Partners', 'Tope Awotona', 'Google’s', 'Microsoft Outlook', 'Calendly', 'UCSF', 'Awotona', 'Jeff Diana', 'Patrick Moran', 'Calendly’s', 'OpenView', 'Atlanta Ventures', 'IncWell', 'SalesLoft', 'Amex', 'Kabbage', 'OneTrust', 'Bakkt', 'Mailchimp', 'Calendly’s', 'Awotona’s', 'TC', 'Blake Bartlett', 'OpenView', 'OpenView', 'the Nigerian Central Bank', 'Unilever', 'the University of Georgia', 'IBM', 'Awotona', 'NCR', 'NCR', 'Awotona', 'Awotona', 'Dropbox', 'Dropbox', 'Awotona', 'Zoom', 'Awotona', 'Zoom', 'Calendly’s.)“We', 'Bartlett', 'Tamedia', 'Undock', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'ArticleHow Atlanta’s Calendly', 'Ingrid Lunden5:48', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/T3Ksgg3xwu,2021-01-26T16:45:05,"GitLab reshuffles its paid subscription plans, drops its Bronze/Starter tier","['GitLab, the increasingly popular DevOps platform, today announced a major update to its subscription model. The company is doing away with its $4/month Bronze/Starter package. Current users will be able to renew one more time at the existing price or move to a higher tier (and receive a significant discount for the first three years after they do so).The company’s free tier, it is worth noting, is not going away and GitLab argues that it includes “89% of the features in Bronze/Starter.”As GitLab founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij told me, this was a difficult decision for the team. He acknowledged that this is a big change for those on the Bronze plan. “I hope that they see that we did our homework and that we have great legacy pricing,” Sijbrandij said, and added that the company will listen to feedback from its users.To ease the pain, Bronze users will be able to renew their existing subscription before January 26, 2022 for an additional year at the existing price. They can also opt to move to the Premium tier at a discounted price for the next three years, starting at $6/user/month in Year 1, but that price then goes up to $9/user/month and $15/user/month in Year 2 and 3 respectively. For new users, the Bronze package is no longer available, starting now.Image Credits: GitLabIn the end, this was a purely financial decision for GitLab. As Sijbrandij told me, the company was losing money on every Bronze-tier customer. “The Bronze tier, we were selling at a loss,” he said. “We were just losing money every time we sold it — just on hosting and support. To be a sustainable business, this was a move we had to make. It’s a big transition for our customers but we want to make sure we’re a sustainable company and we can keep investing.”Sijbrandij told me the team looked at increasing the price of the Bronze tier to make it profitable. “We looked at all options, but in the end, you’re going to have an offering that is very similar to Premium. It would be too much overlap between the two,” he explained.With this change, GitLab now offers three tiers: Free, Premium and Ultimate (it’s also doing away with the “Silver/Premium” and “Gold/Ultimate” naming).The free tier, which in terms of total users is the most popular plan on GitLab, will remain in place. While it is surely a loss-leader for GitLab, it only comes with limited CI/CD credits and doesn’t include any support options, so the overall loss here must have been worth it for the company. Sijbrandij also noted that, as an open core company, having a free and open offering is simply a must.GitLab oversaw a $195 million secondary sale that values the company at $6 billion']",SetSail ,"['GitLab', 'Bronze/Starter', 'NavigationClose', 'Bronze/Starter', 'DevOps', 'GitLab', 'Sid Sijbrandij', 'Sijbrandij', 'Bronze', 'GitLab', 'Sijbrandij', 'Bronze', 'GitLab', 'Ultimate', 'GitLab', 'GitLab', 'Sijbrandij', 'GitLab', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Bronze/Starter', 'DevOps', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/4T7MBYFMBY,2021-01-26T16:40:08,TikTok is being used by vape sellers marketing to teens,"[""TikTok has a vaping problem. Although a 2019 U.S. law made it illegal to sell or market e-cigarettes to anyone under the age of 21, TikTok videos featuring top brands of disposable e-cigarettes and vapes for sale have been relatively easy to find on the app. These videos, set to popular and upbeat music, clearly target a teenage customer base with offers of now-unauthorized cartridge flavors like fruit and mint in the form of a disposable vape. Some sellers even promote their “discreet” packaging services, where the vapes they ship to customers can be hidden from parents’ prying eyes by being placed under the package’s stuffing or tucked inside other products, like makeup bags or fuzzy slippers.Interest in flavored, disposable vapes that appeal to teens and young adults, in particular, has been growing in the wake of the FDA’s Juul crackdown.In February 2020, the FDA first began to take enforcement action against illegally marketed e-cigarette devices, including those offering flavors besides tobacco or menthol, as well as those targeted towards minors — an action that was designed to target Juul.As a result, disposable vapes like Puff Bar were adopted by some young people who were still in search of flavors like bubblegum, peach, strawberry and others. These cheaper disposables were easy to find, and continued to be available at convenience stores and gas stations.But they’re also all over TikTok, ready to be shipped with anyone with a way to pay.What’s more, when this content is reported to TikTok, it’s not always taken down.TechCrunch found vape sellers marketing on TikTok who have been using the app to communicate with customers through both videos and comments. They also direct viewers to what appear to be illegally operating websites. Their TikTok videos often show off the seller’s current inventory of vapes, including disposables like Puff Bar in teen-friendly flavors.Essentially, the sellers are using TikTok as a way to create vape advertisements they don’t have to pay for that are capable of reaching young consumers — an audience whose interest in vaping hasn’t necessarily declined because of the FDA’s action.According to nonprofit tobacco control organization Truth Initiative’s latest study, use of Juul decreased between 2019 and 2020, but it remains the most popular e-cigarette brand among 10th and 12th graders who were current vapers at 41%. The report also found that disposable products such as Puff Bar (8%) and Smok (13.1%) have gained during this time.“Taken together, the 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) and the new e-cigarette sales data report illustrate how the current federal policy enabled youth to quickly migrate to menthol e-cigarettes (especially Juul menthol pods) when mint-flavored products were removed from the marketplace, and for inexpensive, flavored disposable e-cigarettes such as Puff Bar to soar in popularity,” Truth stated in September 2020.“With kid magnet names like cotton candy and banana ice, the market share of disposable products nearly doubled in just 10 months from August 2019 to May 2020,” it said.The scale of the problem on TikTok is also significant.Today, U.S. teens account for an estimated 32.5% of TikTok’s U.S. active users, according to third-party estimates published by Statista. The company has around 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., it said last year.Meanwhile, videos tagged with popular vape and e-cigarette brands and keywords have racked up hundreds of millions of views.For example, the hashtag referring to leading vape brand Juul (#juul) has 623.9 million views on TikTok, as of the time of writing.The hashtag #puffbar, referencing the brand Puff Bar, the maker of a single-use vaping product with Chinese origins, has 449.8 million views. Other brands’ names appear in hashtags, as well. Videos tagged with #njoy have 55.3 million views, #smok have 40.1 million views, and #Vuse, which is a British Tobacco brand, have 5 million views. (*Note that some “njoy” content is related to the slang for “enjoy,” while others are vape-related videos.)These are just the views associated with these specific hashtags. For every search, there are multiple variations. For instance, #puffbars, #puffbarplus and #puffbardealer have 66.8 million views, 9.6 million views and 8.9 million views, respectively.Not all these hashtags are associated with vape or e-cigarette sellers, but demonstrate there is a sizable amount of vape-related content on the app. For example, tags like #juulgang (590.4 million views) have become popular enough that anti-vaping content creators have adopted them as a means of counter-programming against vaping content.These trends are particularly concerning given the large, young demographic that uses TikTok. A third of its U.S. users may be 14 or under, in fact.In the U.S. App Store, TikTok is rated for ages 12 and up and on Google Play, its content rating is “Teen.” But while TikTok has modified the default privacy settings for young people’s accounts and has been quick to block other controversial hashtags in the past (like those around U.S. election conspiracies), it has allowed vaping-related content to remain easy to find.In addition to the popular vaping hashtags prevalent on TikTok, we uncovered numerous vape sellers operating under obvious account names such as “@puffsonthelow,” “@PuffUniverse” and “@Puffbarcafe,” for example. Their pages were filled with vape videos boldly marketing their current selections, hashtagged with vape-related terms like #puffbarchallenge, #puffplus, #vapetricks and others.In some cases, we found vape sellers had even tagged their videos with #kids and other trending tags.Knowing that their target market is often teenage vapers, many videos depicted how the seller could package the vape inside another product or hide it in the stuffing so parents wouldn’t find out. We saw videos of vapes packaged underneath candy, inside makeup bags, inside socks, underneath other lager products, and more.Through links published to the account’s profile or referenced in the videos, TikTok users are redirected to the sellers’ websites or even Discord channels where they would only sometimes be presented with an age verification pop-up.Often, they could just add items to a basket and check out. Many sellers also directed their customers to pay using PayPal, Venmo and/or Cash App, instead of accepting standard credit card payments.None of this is legal, according to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, a leading American nonprofit focused on reducing tobacco consumption, particularly among youth.“It’s illegal to market these products or to engage in marketing that appeals directly to anybody under the age of 21,” Matt Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, told TechCrunch. “And it’s illegal to actually conduct a sales transaction without age verification.”Image Credits: TikTok screenshotPlus, he adds, clicking a box on a website that says “I’m over 21,” does not qualify as a legal age verification for making these sales.The FDA hasn’t issued specific guidance around online retail, but the law is clear that checking IDs is required to ensure retailers aren’t selling to underage users. That’s not happening with a pop-up box, and often there’s no box at all.In addition, the FDA reminded TechCrunch that Congress recently established new limits on the mailing and delivery of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products through the United States Postal Service and through other carriers, which should limit access to these sorts of products through online retail purchases.Myers, however, points out that the current FDA guidelines have made enforcement of this sort of “social” vape marketing more difficult than necessary.“The images you’re seeing, the use of influencers, and the kinds of offers you’re seeing are governed by a federal standard by the FDA, which is very broad and very general,” Myers says. “The FDA’s failure to articulate clear, specific guidelines means that everyone is in a constant what I call ‘whack-a-mole.'”Enforcement, then, often depends on the FDA stepping in, which Myers says happens “on a very sporadic basis.”“In many respects, the behaviors, the actions and the things you’re seeing do violate the law. But the mechanisms for implementing it that were put in place under this past administration are woefully weak and inadequate,” he says.Image Credits: screenshots of TikTokAnother complicating factor is that public health groups — like the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, for instance — don’t have a relationship with TikTok, as they do with other social networks.Over the last couple of years, over 100 public health groups came together to ask leading social networks like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat to clamp down on tobacco-related content and the use of influencers in marketing. As a result of these efforts, Facebook and Instagram implemented new rules to prohibit social media influencers from promoting tobacco-related products and developed algorithms to pick up on that sort of content.Overall, the health organizations have reported seeing a reduction in tobacco and vape content on top social platforms, but these efforts have not yet included TikTok.The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids has not given TikTok a comprehensive review, Myers admits, due to the app still being relatively new.\xa0 But from what the organization has seen so far, TikTok is of growing concern.“We’ve seen some of the most egregious marketing, use of influencers, direct offers of sale to young people [which] appear to be gravitating over to TikTok,” Myers says. “And we don’t see any evidence that TikTok has actually done anything.”TikTok can’t claim ignorance of the problem, either.Image Credits: TikTok screenshotWhen a vape seller who unabashedly advertised “no ID check” was reported to TikTok through its built-in reporting mechanism, TikTok’s content moderation team said the content didn’t violate its guidelines. This same response was given when other vape sellers were reported, as well. (See below.)TikTok claims this shouldn’t be happening. The company told us that it will remove accounts dedicated to posting vaping or e-cigarette content as soon as it becomes aware of them, and will reset account bios that link to off-platform tobacco or vaping sites.It also says its Community Guidelines prohibit content that suggests, depicts, imitates, or promotes the possession or consumption of tobacco by a minor, and content that offers instruction targeting minors on how to buy, sell, or trade tobacco. And it doesn’t permit tobacco ads.Image Credits: screenshots of TikTok reportsReached for comment over whether it was aware of the problems on TikTok, an FDA spokesperson said it does not discuss specific compliance and enforcement activities.However, the spokesperson said the agency will closely monitor retailer, manufacturer, importer, and distributor compliance with federal tobacco laws and regulations and take corrective action when violations occur. In addition, the FDA said it conducts routine monitoring and surveillance of tobacco labeling, advertising and other promotional activities, including activities on the internet.What’s been making matters more confusing is that the FDA has been accepting premarket applications for flavored vape devices, but has so far refused to list which companies — Puff Bar or otherwise — may have filed for these. That means health organizations don’t know which products the FDA has under review.But the Agency told TechCrunch that regardless of whether a premarket application has been submitted, it’s enforcing lack of marketing authorization for any product where the manufacturer “is not taking adequate measures to prevent youth access to these products.”That statement would then include these online Puff Bar retailers and their TikTok marketing efforts.The FDA added that it has taken action against Puff Bar, specifically, in recent days.It sent a warning letter to Cool Clouds Distribution, Inc. d/b/a Puff Bar, last July, notifying the company that it was marketing new tobacco products that lacked marketing authorization and that such products, as a result, were adulterated and misbranded.Earlier this month, as part of an ongoing joint operation with the FDA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 33,681 units of e-cigarettes, which included disposable flavored e-cigarette cartridges resembling the Puff Bar brand, including Puff XXL and Puff Flow, we’re told.TikTok confirmed the activity we’re documenting is in violation of its guidelines and policies, but could not explain why there’s been such a disconnect between that policy and its enforcement actions.“We are committed to the safety and well-being of our TikTok community, and we strictly prohibit content that depicts or promotes the possession or consumption of tobacco and drugs by minors,” a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We will remove accounts that are identified as being dedicated to promoting vaping, and we do not allow ads for vaping products.”\xa0""]",Eric Newcomer,"['TikTok', 'FDA', 'FDA', 'Juul', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'FDA', 'Truth Initiative’s', 'National Youth Tobacco Survey', 'TikTok', 'TikTok’s', 'Statista', 'Juul', 'TikTok', 'Videos', '#Vuse', 'British Tobacco', '#', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'Discord', 'PayPal', 'Venmo', 'Cash App', 'the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids', 'Matt Myers', 'the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids', 'TikTok', 'FDA', 'FDA', 'Congress', 'FDA', 'FDA', 'FDA', 'FDA', 'Myers', 'the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids', 'TikTok', 'Facebook, Instagram', 'TikTok', 'The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids', 'TikTok', 'Myers', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok’s', 'Community Guidelines', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'FDA', 'FDA', 'FDA', 'FDA', 'Agency', 'TikTok', 'FDA', 'a Puff Bar', 'FDA', 'U.S. Customs', 'the Puff Bar', 'Puff XXL', 'Puff Flow', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Sarah Perez5:40 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/bVddXREZTt,2021-01-26T16:31:50,SetSail nabs $26M Series A to rethink sales compensation,"['SetSail wants to upend the way sales people get compensated by paying them throughout the sales cycle, rather than a single commission after the sale closes. Today, the startup announced a $26 million Series A.Insight Partners led the round with participation from existing investors Wing Venture Capital, Team8 and Operator Collective. Today’s investment brings the total raised to $37 million, according to the company.SetSail connects to your CRM, email, calendar and other systems that have signals about the progress of a particular sale, and then using machine learning looks at points in the sales cycle where it would make sense to reward the sales person for the progress they are making.As CEO and co-founder Haggai Levi told me at the time of the startup’s $7 million seed round in July, the single commission system discourages risk taking:“If I’m closing the deal, I’m getting my commission. If I’m not closing the deal, I’m getting nothing. That means from a behavioral point of view, I would take the shortest path to win a deal, and I would take the minimum risk possible. So if there’s a competitive situation I will try to avoid that,” he said in July.He said the idea of changing the way we think about compensation resonated with sales executives during the pandemic, especially as everyone’s role got altered and teams became distributed because of COVID, but he says while rethinking compensation was certainly a big factor so was SetSail’s ability to connect to all of the sales systems to help build these new approaches to pay.“I think it’s even beyond just compensation. […] It’s also connecting to all of your data using an end-to-end platform that helps you understand what’s happening between you, your reps and your customers and allowing you to tie that back in using behavioral science to machine learning-based compensation,” he explained.The company began 2020 with five customers, a reasonable start for an early stage startup, but it ended the year with more than 20 including Cisco, Dropbox and HubSpot. It now has over 5000 sales reps using the platform.In spite of the growing number of users, Levi says they have no plans to aggregate data, leaving each customer’s data as distinct to build the compensation packages that make sense to them. “We try not to play kind of the data, aggregator role because we want to make sure that every customer’s data is encrypted and secured in a completely different container. The trade off between getting knowledge between customers versus receiving their data is is too high in our opinion,” he said.The company now has 35 employees with five more hired who will be starting in the next several weeks and plans to reach 70 by the end of the year. They are thinking hard about how to hire a diverse workforce. For starters, Levi says that the company board has two female members. He says hiring in general is a challenge for every CEO, especially early on, and hiring a diverse group even more so, but he says it’s important to be thinking about this from the start because from a gender perspective at least, you are losing half the talent pool if you ignore it.When the pandemic is over, he sees having at least some in-person office presence in spite of being spread out across San Francisco, New York and Tel Aviv, but it will be probably be a hybrid approach and not require as much office space as they might have rented prior to COVID.SetSail raises $7M to change how sales teams are compensated']",banned in late June,"['SetSail', 'NavigationClose', 'Sean Gladwell', 'Wing Venture Capital', 'SetSail', 'Haggai Levi', 'SetSail', 'Dropbox', 'HubSpot', 'Levi', 'Levi', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/AKn3PaxvAj,2021-01-26T15:41:44,Does a $27 billion or $29 billion valuation make sense for Databricks?,"['Late last week, independent journalist Eric Newcomer\xa0reported that Databricks is raising new capital at a valuation of “about $27 billion.” A few days later, another publication chimed in, saying that they had heard the round could be worth $29 billion at a slightly higher valuation.Well, well!Last year, The Exchange covered Databricks’ financial progress as a private company. Databricks, as a refresher, provides its customers with analytics and data science tooling and\xa0crossed a $350 million run rate at the end of Q3 2020.That figure was up from $200 million in the year-ago period. As we wrote at the time, Databricks was “an obvious IPO candidate” and a company with “broad private-market options.” Reports that it has raised more capital underscore our previous notes.But we took it all one step further after news surfaced that Databricks could go public in the first half of 2021, noodling around with all the financial information we could scrape together for the company to come up with a valuation range. Our resulting figures were a bit low compared to recent news, which forms the crux of our work today: Can we come up with a set of numbers that help make sense of Databricks at $27 billion?Databricks declined to comment. But that won’t stop us from having fun. So, let’s remind ourselves of what we know about Databricks’ growth history, economics and scale.From there we will be able to check our estimates against its purported new valuation range and come up with some implied multiples. Then, we’ll contrast those with some high-flying public companies.Do the numbers somewhat fit? Can we see Databricks making sense at more than $25 billion, more than four times its 2019-era private valuation of $6.2 billion? Let’s find out.What’s it worth?In our previous work, we ran a number of growth scenarios to come up with different estimates for Databricks’ current scale. Sparing you several hundred words, given how the company grew from $200 million in annual run rate to $350 million between Q3 2019 and Q3 2020, we estimated that the company would close Q1 2021 with between $425 million and $486.5 million in annualized revenue.Looking at different data points from the Bessemer Cloud Index at the time while using some flexible-but-not-conservative estimates for Databricks’ revenue quality, we came up with market comps that would have given it a sales multiple of between 20x and 38x. At the high end of our revenue run rate guess for Q1 2021, and top multiple, you get a valuation of $18.5 billion.']",Kafka,"['Nigel Sussman', 'Eric Newcomer', 'The Exchange', 'Databricks’', 'Databricks’', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCDatabricksEC', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/ByqFXW2NK6,2021-01-26T15:27:24,"India retains ban on TikTok, UC Browser and 57 other Chinese apps","['TikTok, UC Browser, UC News, Baidu Map, Xiaomi’s Video and Community and 53 other Chinese apps that India banned in late June won’t be returning to the country anytime soon, the Indian government has decided, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.Last week New Delhi told the parent firms of these apps that the responses it had received so far do not adequately address cybersecurity concerns charged against them, the source said, requesting anonymity as the communication is private.Citing this reason, New Delhi told the firms that it will retain the ban on their apps, but it is not completely shutting communication channels with the firms, the source said. Indian media reported late last week that the country, which is the world’s second largest internet market with over 600 million internet users, was making the ban permanent.Starting in late June, India ended up blocking over 200 apps including PUBG Mobile that have links to China last year amid geo-political tension between the two neighboring nations. All these apps engaged in activities that posed threats to “national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India,” the nation’s IT ministry has said.New Delhi has so far only sent feedback about the responses to the apps that were banned in late June.Among the batch, TikTok has been the most high-profile app to be banned in India. ByteDance’s crown app had more than 200 million users in India prior to being blocked. Despite the ban, however, the company has retained most of its India-based employees so far.A source at ByteDance told TechCrunch that the company operates several properties in India including a productivity suite called Lark that remain operational in the country and the team continues to develop these apps. This information has not been previously reported. (UC Browser, too, was once very popular in India, though the rising popularity of Google’s Chrome browser put an end to the Chinese app’s dominance in the country.)Despite the ban, TikTok and several of the blocked Chinese apps still maintain millions of users in the country who are using specialized software such as VPNs to access them. TikTok had over 5 million active users (MAU) in India last month, and PUBG Mobile over 15 million, according to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch.In a statement, TikTok said it was reviewing New Delhi’s notice. “We continually strive to comply with local laws and regulations and do our best to address any concerns the government may have. Ensuring the privacy and security of all our users remains to be our topmost priority,” a spokesperson said.The ban — as well as the whole U.S. drama about a potential block — on TikTok hasn’t made much impact on ByteDance’s financials. The Information reported on Tuesday that ByteDance more than doubled its revenue last year to $37 billion, and increased its operating profit to $7 billion, from $4 billion in 2019.American and Chinese firms have rushed to India in the past decade in search for their next billion users. But the South Asian nation contributes very little to these firms’ bottom line. Kunal Shah, a serial entrepreneur in India, said at a conference in 2018 that the nation has become an “MAU farm” for many companies.Regardless, since their ban, TikTok and PUBG Mobile have explored ways to make a comeback in India. TikTok engaged in early investment talks with Reliance Industries, one of India’s largest conglomerates, and PUBG Mobile cut ties with game publisher Tencent and pledged to invest $100 million in India.']",Fast,"['TikTok', 'UC Browser', 'NavigationClose ScreenIndia', 'TikTok', 'UC Browser', 'UC Browser', 'UC News', 'Xiaomi’s Video and Community', 'TikTok', 'Lark', 'UC Browser', 'Google’s Chrome', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'MAU', 'App Annie', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'ByteDance’s', 'MAU', 'TikTok', 'Reliance Industries', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'TikTok', 'UC Browser', 'UC Browser', 'UC News', 'Xiaomi’s Video and Community', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/G4G9HNvvM4,2021-01-26T15:15:51,Vectorized announces $15.5M investment to build simpler streaming data tool,"['Streaming data is not new. Kafka has existed as an open source tool for a decade. Vectorized was founded on the premise that the existing tools were too complex and not designed for today’s streaming requirements. Today the company released its first product, Redpanda, an open source tool designed to make it easier for developers to build streaming data applications.While it was at it, the startup announced a $15.5 million funding round, which is actually a combination of a previously unannounced $3 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and a $12.5 million Series A, which was also from Lightspeed with help from Google Ventures.Redpanda is an open source tool that is delivered as an “intelligent API” to help “turn data streams into products,” company founder and CEO Alexander Gallego explained. It’s built to be a Kafka replacement, while remaining Kafka-compatible to help deal with backwards compatibility.At the same time, it takes a more modern approach. Gallego points out that teams building data streaming applications have been getting lost in the complexity and he recognized an opportunity to build a company to simplify that.“People are drowning in complexity today managing Kafka, ZooKeeper (an open source configuration management tool) and the data lake,” he said, adding “We enable new things that couldn’t be done before for several reasons: one is performance, one is simplicity and the other one is this store procedures.”He says that the key to developer adoption is making the product free through open source, and having Kafka compatibility so that developers don’t feel like they have to just dump existing projects and start from scratch. While the company is launching with an open source tool, it plans to use the funding to build a hosted version of Redpanda to put it within reach of more organizations. “This funding round in particular is to power our cloud,” he said.Arif Janmohamed, a partner at Lightspeed Ventures who is leading the investment in Vectorized sees a company looking to improve upon an existing technology with a better approach. “With a simple, elegant solution that doesn’t require any changes to an existing application’s code, Vectorized delivers 10x better performance, a much simpler management paradigm, and new functionality that will unleash the next set of real-time applications for the next decade,” Janmohamed said.The company has 22 employees today with plans to add another 8 in the first half of this year, mostly engineers to help build the hosted version. As a Latino founder, Gallego is acutely aware of the need for a diverse and inclusive workforce. “What I have found is that being a [Latino] CEO, it attracts more people that look like me, and so that’s been a big thing, and it’s made a difference [in attracting diverse candidates],” he said.One concrete thing he has done is start a scholarship to encourage under represented groups to become developers. “I started a scholarship where we just give money and mentorship to communities of Latino, Black and female developers, or people that want to transition to software engineering,” he said. While he says he does it without strings attached, he does hope that some of these folks could become part of the tech industry eventually, and perhaps even work at his company.']",Jam,"['Vectorized', '15.5M', 'NavigationClose', 'Miller@ron_miller', 'L / Getty ImagesStreaming', 'Kafka', 'Vectorized', 'Redpanda', 'Lightspeed Venture Partners', 'Google Ventures', 'Alexander Gallego', 'Kafka', 'Kafka', 'Kafka', 'ZooKeeper', 'Kafka', 'Arif Janmohamed', 'Lightspeed Ventures', 'Vectorized', 'Vectorized', 'Janmohamed', 'Latino', 'Gallego', 'Latino, Black', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', '15.5M', 'Kafka', 'Vectorized', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Kmt6hHquiV,2021-01-26T15:03:43,Fast raises $102M as the online checkout wars continue to attract huge investment,"['This morning Fast, a startup that provides online checkout and identity products, announced that it has closed a $102 million Series B. The new funding event was led by Stripe, a previous investor in Fast.Stripe, an online payments giant, also led Fast’s Series A last year, a deal worth $20 million. Fast has raised $124 million to date, it said in a release.TechCrunch reached out to Fast for comment regarding its growth pace. The company shared that gross merchandise volume (GMV) processed by its checkout service has “more than tripled each month,” adding that it expects that “trend to continue and increase.” The growth pace is hard to rate as we lack a base from which to scale, but we do now have an expectation for future GMV progress from Fast that we can use as a measuring stick.Fast’s outsized Series B comes after a number of rival online checkout providers have also raised large rounds.In late December Bolt, which provides online checkout, identity, and payments services raised a $75 million extension to its Series C round. The company also shared a number of growth metrics, allowing TechCrunch to get a handle on its current size, and expectations for future performance.Then in mid-January Checkout.com raised $450 million at a $15 billion valuation. TechCrunch wrote at the time that “Checkout.com wants to build a one-stop shop for all things related to payments, such as accepting transactions, processing them and detecting fraud.” So, similar to Bolt and in competition with elements of what Fast offers.Finally, Rapyd announced that it raised $300 million at a $2.5 billion valuation one day later. Rapyd provides fintech services via an API, TechCrunch noted, but as it does support global ecommerce payments and sells anti-fraud tech, it seems to fit inside this group.Tack on Fast’s new Series B and inside the last month or so we’ve seen $927 million — at least — flow into startups with overlapping ecommerce infrastructure market targets. That’s just under $26 million a day since the Bolt round, an enormous amount of capital in a short period of time.How are the companies all raising in such rapid-fire fashion? The most obvious answer to the question is that ecommerce is so big, and so critical to the global economy, that improving the experience of vending goods online for both sellers and buyers is a problem space with room for many players. That so many startups in the race to solve online commerce have each raised implies that they are all, so far, enjoying strong growth rates; and that implies a gigantic market into which they all hope to grow.And it’s hard to argue in the wake of COVID-19 boosting ecommerce, and generally accelerating the digitization of the global economy, that such technologies will be constrained by market size anytime soon.']",Mirror founder Brynn Putnam on life with Lululemon — and whether or not she sold too soon,"['NavigationClose', 'Stripe', 'Fast’s Series', 'GMV', 'GMV', 'Fast’s', 'Bolt', 'Checkout.com', 'Bolt', 'Bolt', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsBoltCheckout.comFastrapydFast', 'Stripe', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/2a3hfoMLbL,2021-01-26T15:00:26,"Talent Hack raises $4.7M for its B2C fitness platform, Spaces","['It’s been a wild 12 months for fitness platforms, as the world’s population has struggled to adapt to workouts outside of the gym. From Lululemon’s massive Mirror acquisition to companies like Apple and Samsung launching their own solutions, exercise technology has thrived amid the pandemic.Talent Hack is one of a large (and growing) number of companies looking to make fitness more accessible in a world where the gym just isn’t an option for many. Rather than creating its own front-end, curated platform, however, the New York-based startup’s Spaces is designed to offer a B2C platform for fitness instructors and studios.This week, the company announced that it has raised a $4.7 million seed round, led by Global Founders Capital. The Fund is also participating in the round, along with Mindbody Online’s Rick Stollmeyer, as well as Lucy Deland, Hannah Bronfman, Amanda Freeman, Ellie Burrows and Amy Klein.Spaces has been operating with a relatively low public profile since January 2019, though more than 50,000 fitness professions have signed up for the service. The company says it’s managed to help top earners pull in $250,000.“We are the first fitness and technology company that is a true partner for the individual wellness instructor, facilitating agency and power to the individual in the rising 30% YoY at-home fitness market,” CEO and co-founder Alexandra Bonetti says in a release tied to the news. “Our mission is to empower fitness and wellness professionals with the tools and resources they need to propel and scale their businesses so they can remain focused on what they do best.”Talent Hack says this round will go toward increasing its marketing, improving the customer experience and expanding recruiting.Mirror founder Brynn Putnam on life with Lululemon — and whether or not she sold too soon']",PepsiCo,"['Hack', 'NavigationClose', 'SpacesBrian Heater@bheater', 'Mirror', 'Apple', 'Samsung', 'Hack', '’s Spaces', 'Global Founders Capital', 'Mindbody Online’s', 'Rick Stollmeyer', 'Lucy Deland', 'Hannah Bronfman', 'Amanda Freeman', 'Ellie Burrows', 'Amy Klein', 'Alexandra Bonetti', 'Hack', 'Brynn Putnam', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'FundingStartupsfitnessglobal', 'Hack', 'SpacesBrian Heater4:00', 'Mirror', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/BLN6qp2arf,2021-01-26T14:59:02,Treadly’s next-gen compact treadmill is ideal for small spaces and features app-based social workouts,"['As the global pandemic continues, having options for keeping active at home is increasingly top-of-mind. Treadly is a startup focused on building a home treadmill that’s compact and convenient, with smart connected features that boost engagement. The company recently released its second-generation product, and it’s super compact, with hardware improvements that boost the weight limit for users and add cooling benefits that extend workout times.BasicsTreadly’s design is probably a lot smaller than you’re expecting – it’s just 3.7-inches tall for the base, and it weights just 77 lbs. The whole deck is just 56-inches long by 25-inches wide, and there’s a flip-down handle that you extend when you want to jog at a faster pace, while folding it away for strictly walking workouts.There’s a display built into the deck itself, offering a simple but easy to read black and white readout of key stats, including speed, total steps, time and distance. The handrail features manual controls, and the Treadly 2 can also be controlled either via a dedicated remote control for the basic model, or through the Treadly app (iOS only now, but Android coming soon) via Bluetooth for the upgraded Treadly 2 Pro version.The Treadly 2 also features a built-in Bluetooth speaker, which allows you to connect your smartphone and play music via whatever app you want. The Treadly iOS app also offers community iterative training, and live video integration. Treadly is also introducing new groups features to the app to allow users form their own communities, and also new challenges that users can issue to one another, like step count records and more.Design and featuresTreadly’s design is very compact, as mentioned, and it’s the perfect size for small spaces. It’ll slide easily under most couches thanks to its low height, and it can also be stored vertically if you want to put it against the wall or in a larger closet. The design is also attractive and minimal, which make it more unobtrusive than most exercise equipment even if left out in plain view.The built-in display in the deck itself is a nice accommodation for keeping the dimensions compact, while also providing all the feedback you’d expect from a piece of home gym equipment. It’d be easier to check periodically if it was mounted into the fold-down handlebar, but that would definitely lead to increased bulk. Plus, having the stats slightly difficult to access is probably actually better for many people, since zeroing in on those can make a workout more arduous than it needs to be.For the basic model, the remote is effective and compact, with a wriststrap included so that you can keep track of it easily while using the treadmill. The built-in Bluetooth speaker isn’t amazing, as you might expect, but it’s more than good enough to provide a soundtrack if you don’t have other speakers or earbuds on hand to use.Image Credits: TreadlyAs for the experience of actually using Treadly 2 to run or walk, it definitely delivers, with a few caveats: First, don’t expect this to provide a true indoor running experience. While it definitely offers impressive weight capacity for a treadmill of this size, the max speed is 5 mph, which is a low-intensity jog for most people. With the handrail down, that drops to just 3.7 mph, which is a brisk walk.For something this compact, that’s actually still very impressive – especially since there’s no time limit on how long you can use the treadmill at 5 mph thanks to Treadly 2’s new and improved cooling system. For avoiding a sedentary lifestyle while remaining mostly indoors, the Treadly 2’s speed settings more than deliver, and that’s probably enough for most users, advanced fitness buffs excluded.Bottom lineThe Treadly 2 is a connected treadmill that provides a great blend of convenience, social features, guided usage, connected control and space-saving design into a reasonably-priced package starting at $749 for the Basic and $849 for the Pro with special New Year Sale pricing. It’s like the Peloton that most people are actually more likely to use long-term, and it’s a great way to stay active during the long winter months in our unprecedented times.']",told a parliamentary subcommittee,"['Treadly’s', 'NavigationClose ScreenTreadly’s', 'Etherington@etherington', 'BasicsTreadly’s', 'Android', 'Basic', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'TechnologysmartphonetechnologyTreadly’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/N0AZ2fsfWq,2021-01-26T14:17:13,Facebook’s secret settlement on Cambridge Analytica gags UK data watchdog,"['Remember the app audit Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg promised to carry out a little under three years ago at the height of the Cambridge Analytica scandal? Actually the tech giant is very keen that you don’t.The UK’s information commissioner just told a parliamentary subcommittee on online harms and disinformation that a secret arrangement between her office and Facebook prevents her from publicly answering whether or not Facebook contacted the ICO about completing a much-trumpeted ‘app audit’.“I think I could answer that question with you and the committee in private,” information commissioner Elizabeth Denham told questioner, Kevin Brennan, MP.Pressed on responding, then and there, on the question of whether Facebook ever notified the regulator about completing the app audit — with Brennan pointing out “after all it was a commitment Mark Zuckerberg gave in the public domain before a US Senate committee” — Denham referred directly to a private arrangement with Facebook which she suggested prevented her from discussing such details in public.“It’s part of an agreement that we struck with Facebook,” she told the committee. “In terms of our litigation against Facebook. So there is an agreement that’s not in the public domain and that’s why I would prefer to discuss this in private.”The UK Information Commissioner has previously passed information to FB re: Cambridge Analytica, and has a secret legal settlement w/ themThis will be a worry to anyone who has passed information to them (e.g. whistleblowers)Long term this practice will have chilling effects https://t.co/an7dgnZADY— Paul-Olivier Dehaye (@podehaye) January 26, 2021In October 2019 Facebook settled with the UK’s data protection watchdog — agreeing to pay in full a £500,000 penalty announced by the ICO in 2018 in relation to the Cambridge Analytica breach but which Facebook had been appealing.When it settled with the ICO Facebook did not admit liability. It had earlier secured a win, from a first-tier legal tribunal that had held June that “procedural fairness and allegations of bias” against the regulator should be considered as part of its appeal, so its litigation against Facebook had got off to a bad start — likely providing the impetus for the ICO to settle with Facebook’s private army of in-house lawyers.In a\xa0statement at the time, covering the bare bones of the settlement, the ICO said Denham considered the agreement “best serves the interests of all UK data subjects who are Facebook users”.There was no mention of any ‘gagging clauses’ in that disclosure. But the regulator did note that the terms of the agreement gave Facebook permission to “retain documents disclosed by the ICO during the appeal for other purposes, including furthering its own investigation into issues around Cambridge Analytica”.So — at a stroke — Facebook gained control of a whole lot of strategically important information.The settlement looks to have been extremely convenient for Facebook. Not only was it fantastically cheap (Facebook paid $5BN to settle with the FTC in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal just a short while later); and not only did it provide Facebook with a trove of ICO-obtained data to do its own digging into Cambridge Analytica safely out of the public eye; but it also ensured the UK regulator would be restricted in what it could say publicly.To the point where the information commissioner has refused to say anything about Facebook’s post-Cambridge Analytica app audit in public.The ICO seized a massive trove of data from the disgraced (and since defunct) company which had become such a thorn in Facebook’s side, after raidingCambridge Analytica’s UK offices in early 2018. How much of that data ended up with Facebook via the ICO settlement is unclear.Interestingly, the ICO also never produced a final report on its Cambridge Analytica investigation.Cambridge Analytica sought to use Facebook data to predict partisanship for voter targeting, UK investigation confirmsInstead it sent a letter to the DCMS committee last year — in which it set out a number of conclusions, confirming its view that the umbrella of companies of which CA was a part had been aggregating datasets from commercial sources to try to “make predictions on personal data for political alliance purposes”, as it put it; also confirming the improperly obtained Facebook data had been incorporated into a pre-existing database containing “voter file, demographic and consumer data for US individuals”.The ICO also said then that its investigation did not find evidence of the Facebook data that had been sold to Cambridge Analytica had been used for political campaigning associated with the UK’s Brexit Referendum. But there was no overarching report detailing the underlying workings via which the regulator got to its conclusions.So, again from Facebook’s perspective, a pretty convenient outcome.Asked today by the DCMS committee why the regulator had not produced the expected final report on Cambridge Analytica, Denham pointed to a number of other reports it put out over the course of the multi-year probe, such as audits of UK political parties and an investigation into credit reporting agencies.“The letter was extensive,” she also argued. “My office produced three reports on the investigation into the misuse of data in political campaigning. So we had a policy report and we had two enforcement reports. So we had looked at the entire ecosystem of data sharing and campaigning… and the strands of that investigation are reported out sufficiently, in my view, in all of our work.”“Taken together the letter, which was our final line on the report, with the policy and the enforcement actions, prosecutions, fines, stop processing orders, we had done a lot of work in this space — and what’s important here is that we have really pulled back the curtain on the use of data in democracy which has been taken up by… many organizations and parliamentarians around the world,” she added.Denham also confirmed to the committee that the ICO has retained data related to the Cambridge Analytica investigation — which could be of potential use to other investigations still ongoing around the world. But she denied that her office had been asked by the US Senate Intelligence Committee to provide it with information obtained from Cambridge Analytica — seemingly contradicting an earlier report by the US committee that suggested it had been unable to obtain sought for information. (We’ve contacted the committee to ask about this. Update: Senator Warner’s office has now told us: “The Committee did engage with the ICO.”)Denham did say evidence obtained from Cambridge Analytica was shared with the FTC, SEC and with states attorneys general, though.We’ve also reached out to Facebook about its private arrangement with the ICO, and to ask again about the status of its post-Cambridge Analytica ‘app audit’. (And will update this report with any response.)The company has produced periodic updates about the audit’s progress, saying in May 2018 that around 200 apps had been suspended as a result of the internal probe, for example.Then in August 2019 Facebook also claimed to the DCMS committee that the app audit was “ongoing”.In its original audit pledge — in March 2018 — Zuckerberg promised a root and branch investigation into any other ‘sketchy’ apps operating on Facebook’s platform, responding in a ‘crisis’ length Facebook post to the revelations that a third party had illicitly obtained data on millions of users with the aim of building psychographic profiles for voter targeting. It later turned out that an app developer, operating freely on Facebook’s platform under existing developer policies, had sold user data to Cambridge Analytica.“We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity,” Zuckerberg wrote at the time. “We will ban any developer from our platform that does not agree to a thorough audit. And if we find developers that misused personally identifiable information, we will ban them and tell everyone affected by those apps. That includes people whose data [Aleksandr] Kogan misused here as well.”It’s notable that the Facebook founder did not promise to transparently and publicly report audit findings. This is of course what ‘self regulation’ looks like. Invisible final ‘audit’ reports.An ‘audit’ that’s entirely controlled by an entity deeply implicated in core elements of what’s being scrutinized obviously isn’t worth the paper it’s (not) written on. But, in Facebook’s case, this opened-but-never-closed ‘app audit’ appears to have served its crisis PR purpose.Mark Zuckerberg threatened to end Facebook’s UK investment in private 2018 meeting with digital chief, warning over ‘anti-tech’ tone']",Stacker,"['Analytica', 'NavigationClose ScreenFacebook’s', 'Analytica', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'ICO', 'Elizabeth Denham', 'Kevin Brennan', 'Brennan', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'US Senate', 'Denham', 'Paul-Olivier Dehaye', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'Denham', 'ICO', 'FTC', 'ICO', 'Analytica', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'Analytica', 'DCMS', 'ICO', 'Cambridge Analytica', 'Brexit Referendum', 'DCMS', 'Denham', 'Denham', 'ICO', 'the US Senate Intelligence Committee', 'Analytica', 'Warner', 'Analytica', 'FTC', 'SEC', 'ICO', 'DCMS', 'Zuckerberg', 'Zuckerberg', 'Aleksandr', 'Kogan', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'Facebook’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Analytica', 'watchdogNatasha Lomas3:17 PM GMT+1•January 26', 'Mark Zuckerberg', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

But Pindrop’s tech, which was developed initially as an anti-fraud technology for financial services firms and big business customers, goes beyond basic voice recognition.Pindrop’s tech can tell the difference between different speakers, setting up opportunities for the personalization of programming with each user being able to call up their individual account for Netflix, Amazon or other services with simple voice commands.“Beyond just understanding what was said, we want to understand the context of the situation to drive intelligent system behavior in the moment,” said Jon Heim, Senior Director of Product & Conversation Services at TiVo. “The ability to distinguish between different members of a household based on their voice is an example of this contextual awareness, enabling us to provide an unprecedented level of personalization through an experience tailored to that specific person.”It’s cool.When different users say the “What should I watch?” prompt, TiVo devices can now pull up personalized content they are most likely to want to watch. If another member of the household says the same command, the device will display different results. The technology requires user opt-in, and while Pindrop’s tech can differentiate between speakers, the identity of the speaker is anonymized.\xa0It’s a service that Pindrop has already rolled out to eight of the ten largest banks in the U.S., according to Pindrop co-founder and chief executive Vijay Balasubramanian.

https://t.co/0VeZLiRYjY,2021-01-26T14:00:55,Stacker raises $1.7M to help nocoders build apps from spreadsheets,"['Stacker, a company that helps non-developers create software from spreadsheets, announced that it has raised $1.7 million in a seed round.Stacker fits inside the growing no-code, and low-code niche that TechCrunch has explored at length over the last year. But its approach to the topic is worth examining, as is its new funding round.According to Stacker CEO Michael Skelly, the idea for his company came from his time at an asset management company where he had helped build internal apps using Salesforce’s platform. Later on in his career, he found the process more difficult without as assistive service, and noticed that teams in need of engineering time — even for more modest changes to how something worked — were stuck waiting in a long line for developer attention.Thinking back to his former experience building tools on Salesforce’s platform, he decided to build something that would help non-technical end-users at companies build their own apps, as they know best what they need.By now this concept should be familiar to anyone who has spent time in the no-code space; allowing non-technical teams to build their own app is a somewhat normal effort. But Stacker is betting that people already know how to get data into a spreadsheet, and that they don’t want to build an app from zero.Tracking the growth of low-code, no-code startupsSo, users of Google Sheets and the popular Airtable, can use Stacker to build apps\xa0from their spreadsheets. In Skelly’s view, lots of people already use spreadsheets as a way to make software of a sort; spreadsheets are a workaround, in his perspective, used by non-developers to get as far as they can towards building their own solution. So, turn those into real apps, let the end-users tinker with them, and presto, non-technical teams are off on their own.Stacker’s method also solves the issue of expecting users to start from scratch, adding buttons to a blank screen, as the service will make users an initial app from their selected Google Sheet, or Airtable.If that seems like a narrow use case, it isn’t. Skelly was clear during an interview with TechCrunch that he is not trying to help non-developers build the next mega-product. Instead, he wants to help teams build neat internal apps. And that market is proving out so far, with Stacker racking up 500 customers so far. TechCrunch noted that the company had 250 in August of 2020, when the startup took part in Y Combinator’s demo day. Today the company has reached $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), it said. You can infer growth rates from the three data points.Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industriesInitialized Capital led the startup’s round, with participation from Y Combinator, Pioneer Fund and Makerpad. The capital was closed in September of 2020, but announced today as Stacker wanted to skip the holiday dead zone. That makes the round about as temporally laggy as most seed deals.What’s next for Stacker’s distributed team of 12? Skelly told TechCrunch that some folks are using Stacker not just for customer portals or other simple uses, but to create daily-use apps. So the startup wants to invest in making that better, and bring the ability to link even more data sources — think SaaS apps, and the like — in time to allow for what we reckon is more rich app use-cases.Finally, to whom does Stacker sell? On the customer front, it said that most of its customers are SMBs. That makes sense, as larger companies have more internal development resources. But to whom might Stacker sell? At the end of our call, TechCrunch jokingly enjoined the company not to exit early to Airtable. The CEO said that he tells people that in five years that his company will buy Airtable. That was a good answer.']",Bloomreach,"['Stacker', 'NavigationClose ScreenStacker', 'Markus Spiske', 'Stacker', 'Michael Skelly', 'Salesforce’s', 'Stacker', 'Google Sheets', 'Stacker', 'Stacker', 'Y Combinator’s', 'ARR', 'Y Combinator', 'Pioneer Fund', 'Makerpad', 'Stacker', 'Stacker', 'Stacker', 'Stacker', 'SMBs', 'Stacker', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCno', 'CombinatorStacker', 'Wilhelm3:00 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The new round was led by Insight Partners, with participation from existing investors TLV Partners and S Capital. This brings the company’s total funding to date to $43 million.At the core of Run:AI’s platform is the ability to effectively virtualize and orchestrate AI workloads on top of its Kubernetes-based scheduler. Traditionally, it was always hard to virtualize GPUs, so even as demand for training AI models has increased, a lot of the physical GPUs often set idle for long periods because it was hard to dynamically allocate them between projects.Image Credits: Run.AIThe promise behind Run:AI’s platform is that it allows its users to abstract away all of the AI infrastructure and pool all of their GPU resources — no matter whether in the cloud or on-premises. This also makes it easier for businesses to share these resources between users and teams. In the process, IT teams also get better insights into how their compute resources are being used.“Every enterprise is either already rearchitecting themselves to be built around learning systems powered by AI, or they should be,” said Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners and now a board member at Run:AI.” Just as virtualization and then container technology transformed CPU-based workloads over the last decades, Run:AI is bringing orchestration and virtualization technology to AI chipsets such as GPUs, dramatically accelerating both AI training and inference. The system also future-proofs deep learning workloads, allowing them to inherit the power of the latest hardware with less rework. In Run:AI, we’ve found disruptive technology, an experienced team and a SaaS-based market strategy that will help enterprises deploy the AI they’ll need to stay competitive.”Run:AI says that it is currently working with customers in a wide variety of industries, including automotive, finance, defense, manufacturing and healthcare. These customers, the company says, are seeing their GPU utilization increase from 25 to 75% on average.“The new funds enable Run:AI to grow the company in two important areas: first, to triple the size of our development team this year,” the company’s CEO Omri Geller told me. “We have an aggressive roadmap for building out the truly innovative parts of our product vision — particularly around virtualizing AI workloads — a bigger team will help speed up development in this area.

Today’s funding values the company at $900 million.At the same time, the company announced it has acquired Exponea, a startup that gives Bloomreach a marketing automation component it had been missing. The two companies did not reveal the acquisition price, but along with the pure functionality, the company gains 200 additional employees, which is significant, considering Bloomreach had 300 prior to the acquisition. It also gains 250 net new customers, giving it a total of 750.“Historically, we have had two major pillars of the business — the search part of it and the content part,” Bloomreach CEO and co-Founder Raj De Datta told TechCrunch. The content management component lets customers build websites, while the search powers the search box, navigation and merchandising. He points out that all of it is powered by an underlying data analysis engine that matches data to people and people to products.Exponea will give the company more of a complete platform of services, allowing marketers to target and personalize their marketing messages across multiple channels. De Datta says the two companies had similar missions and made a good fit. “We have a common vision and common sort of product direction. […] Both companies are data-driven optimization technologies[…] and both are entrepreneurial product-driven companies,” he said.It also helped that they had been partnering together for six months prior to the sale, which has now closed. Exponea was founded in 2016 in Slovakia and has raised over $57 million, according to Pitchbook data. The plan is to leave Exponea as a stand-alone product, while finding ways to integrate it more smoothly with the other components in the Bloomreach platform. They expect the integration parts to happen over the next year.While De Datta did not want to share specific revenue figures, he did say that the company had a record second half as business was pushed online due to the pandemic. Michael McGinn, partner at Sixth Street and co-head at investor Sixth Street Growth doesn’t see the demand for eCommerce abating, even post-COVID, and that will drive a need for more customized online shopping experiences.“Technology serving more bespoke customer experiences is a rapidly expanding market and we are pleased to join Bloomreach in its leadership of the digital commerce experience and marketing sector,” McGinn said in a statement.De Datta says the money was used in part to buy Exponea, but he also plans to invest more in engineering to continue building the product line. The ultimate goal is an IPO, but as you would expect, he wasn’t ready to commit to any timeline just yet.“I wouldn’t say we have a timeline, but our goal is that the company over the course of 2021 should make investments towards that, so that it’s an option for us.”BloomReach shoots for more complete digital experience with Hippo acquisition']",surveyed venture capitalists,"['NavigationClose', 'ExponeaRon Miller@ron_miller', 'John Lamb / Getty ImagesBloomreach', 'eCommerce', 'Exponea', 'De Datta', 'Pitchbook', 'Michael McGinn', 'eCommerce', 'McGinn', 'De Datta', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkCopy Share', 'AcquisitionsSearchSixth Street Growthweb', 'eCommerce', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/7mqQDFJcM2,2021-01-26T04:10:04,"Forget winning, can Amazon survive in India?","['During a visit to India in 2014, Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos made a splashy announcement: His firm was investing $2 billion in the South Asian nation, just a year after beginning operations in the country.Amazon’s announcement underscored how far India had come to open up to foreign firms. The nation, which had largely kept doors shut to international giants between its independence in 1947 to liberalization in 1991, has slowly transformed itself into the world’s largest open market.In a televised interview in 2014, Bezos said that there was a perception about India not being an easy place to do business. But Amazon’s growth in the country, he said, was proof that this belief is not accurate.“Are there obstacles? There are always obstacles. Anywhere you go, every country has its own regulations and rules,” he said.Six years, and more than $4.5 billion of additional investments later, Amazon today appears to be facing more obstacles than ever in India, the second-largest internet market with more than 600 million users.Long-standing laws in India have constrained Amazon, which has yet to turn a profit in the country, and other e-commerce firms to not hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.India got around to fixing this loophole in late 2018 in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to delist hundreds of thousands of items from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.Now the nation is set to further toughen this approach. Reuters reported last week that New Delhi is considering making adjustments to some provisions that would prevent affiliated firms to hold even an indirect stake in a seller through their parent.The Confederation of All India Traders, an Indian trade body that claims to represent over 80 million businesses, told the publication that Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has assured the organization that it is working to shortly address concerns about alleged violations of current rules.The forthcoming policy change is only one of the many headaches for the world’s largest e-commerce firm in India.Offline retailers in India have long expressed concerns about what they allege to be unfair practices employed by Amazon in India. Last year, during Bezos’ visit to the country, they held several protests. (Photo by SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP via Getty Images)Amazon is aggressively fighting a battle to block a deal between its estranged partner Future Group and Reliance Retail, the two largest retail chains in India.Last year, Future Group announced that it would sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses to Reliance Retail for $3.4 billion. Amazon, which in 2019 bought stakes in one of Future Group’s unlisted firms, says that the Indian firm has breached its contract (which would have given Amazon the right to first refusal) and engaged in insider trading.Despite technology giants and investors ploughing more than $20 billion to create an e-commerce market in India in the past decade, online retail still accounts for only a single-digit pie of all retail in the country.In recent years, Amazon, Walmart and scores of other startups have embraced this realization and sought to work with neighborhood stores that dot tens of thousands of cities, towns and villages in India.From India’s richest man to Amazon and 100s of startups: The great rush to win neighborhood storesWith Reliance Retail and telecom giant Jio Platforms, two subsidiaries of one of India’s largest corporates (Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries) entering the e-commerce market, and receiving the backing of global giants including Facebook and Google last year, cornering a big stake in Future Group is one of the few ways Amazon can accelerate its growth in India.The American e-commerce firm has had little luck so far in overturning the deal between the Indian firms. Last year, Amazon reached out to Indian antitrust body Competition Commission of India, and market regulator SEBI to block this transaction. Both the bodies have ruled in favor of Future Group and Reliance Retail.Amazon must have foreseen this outcome because it initiated the legal proceedings at an arbitration court in Singapore. It’s no surprise that the firm chose to also pursue its legal argument outside of India.Most cases that reach the Singapore International Arbitration Court have come from India in recent years. Vodafone, which has invested more than $20 billion in India, and has been dealt with billions of dollars in unpaid taxes by the country, is another high-profile name to have knocked on the door in Singapore. After losing in India, it emerged victorious in the Singapore arbitration court last year.Amazon on Monday filed a new petition in Delhi High Court in which it is seeking to enforce SIAC’s ruling (which ordered last year that the deal should be temporarily halted) and prevent the Indian firm from going ahead with the deal based on CCI and SEBI’s judgements.The company alleges that Future Group “deliberately and maliciously” disobeyed the international arbitration ruling from SIAC. In its petition, Amazon is also seeking detention of Kishore Biyani, the founder and chairman of Future Group.“Vocal for Local”As India grappled with containing the spread of the coronavirus last year, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the 1.3 billion citizens to make the country “self-reliant” and “be vocal for local.”The move to turn inwards contrasts with his major promise in the first few years of assuming power in 2014 when he pledged to make India more welcoming to foreign firms than before. In recent years, India has proposed or enforced several regulations that hurt American firms, though none appear to suffer as much as Amazon.Last year,\xa0New Delhi started to enforce a 2% tax on all foreign billings for digital services provided in the country. The U.S. Trade Representative said earlier this month that India was taxing numerous categories of digital services that are “not leviable under other digital services taxes adopted around the world.”The aggregate tax bill for U.S. companies could exceed $30 million per year in India, USTR’s investigation found. In conclusion, it found India’s digital tax move to be inconsistent with international tax principles, unreasonable and burdening or restricting U.S. commerce.Modi’s new way of life for India will be music to the ears of Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, an ally of the prime minister and India’s richest man.Before selling stakes worth over $20 billion in Jio Platforms and more than $6 billion in Reliance Retail to marquee foreign investors, Ambani famously made a speech in 2019 in which he urged the need to protect Indians’ data in patriotic terms.“We have to collectively launch a new movement against data colonization. For India to succeed in this data-driven revolution, we will have to migrate the control and ownership of Indian data back to India — in other words, Indian wealth back to every Indian,” he said.Why so many international firms have invested in one of Reliance’s properties remains a big question. A senior executive at an American firm told TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity (out of fear of retribution) that the investments in Jio Platforms, which is India’s largest telecom network with nearly 410 million subscribers, and Reliance Retail is a déjà vu moment for the nation, where a few decades ago one of the only ways to do business in the nation was to partner with a local firm with massive political clout.In a series of tweets, Raman Chima, a former policy executive at Google and who now works at nonprofit digital advocacy group Access Now, alleged that the Android-maker had weighed in 2011-12 partnering and investing in a firm like Reliance to “turn-the-page on Indian political risks.”The idea prompted concerns about Google’s values, he claimed. “More than one executive involved in those discussions flagged concerns around Reliance’s reputation, particularly around problematic approaches towards gaining influence with policymaking civil servants and politicians, money, ethics in govt-business relationships.”Amazon itself was rumored to be interested in getting a multi-billion-dollar stake in Reliance Retail last year, but it appears the two firms have stopped engaging on any matter.BJP MLA Ram Kadam and his party workers protest against the Amazon Prime web series Tandav outside Bandra-Kurla Police station, on January 18, 2021 in Mumbai, India. (Photo by Pratik Chorge/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)While Amazon sorts out these issues, last week delivered another blow to the firm. A senior executive with the firm as well as Indian makers of a mini-series for Amazon Prime Video are under threat of criminal prosecution in the country after Modi’s ruling party deemed the show offensive to the country’s Hindu majority.A Hindu nationalist group, politicians with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and a BJP group representing members of India’s lower castes, were among those who had filed police reports against the nine-part mini-series “Tandav” and Amazon. The company bowed to the pressure and edited out some scenes.“The true reason for the complaints against ‘Tandav’ may be that the show holds up a mirror uncomfortably close to Indian society and some of the problems blamed on Mr. Modi’s administration. In the opening episode, the show features protesting students and disgruntled farmers, echoing events that have taken place in recent months,” The New York Times wrote.“Mirzapur,” another show of Amazon, also attracted a criminal complaint in India last week for hurting religious and regional sentiments and defaming the Indian town. The Indian Supreme Court has issued notices to the makers of “Mirzapur” and has sought responses.In the aforementioned interview, Bezos said Amazon’s job was to follow all the unique rules various countries require it to comply with and “adapt our business practice to those rules.”In India, the company is increasingly being asked how far it is willing to adapt its business practice. How far is it willing to bend that it’s no longer the Amazon people care about?']",Sidecar Health,"['Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Indranil Aditya', 'NurPhoto / Getty Images (Image', 'Amazon', 'Jeff Bezos', 'Amazon’s', 'Bezos', 'Amazon’s', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Flipkart', 'Reuters', 'The Confederation of All India Traders', 'Commerce', 'Piyush Goyal', 'Amazon', 'Future Group', 'Reliance Retail', 'Future Group', 'Reliance Retail', 'Amazon', 'Future Group’s', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', '100s', 'Reliance Retail', 'Jio Platforms', 'Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries', 'Future Group', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Competition Commission of India', 'Future Group', 'Reliance Retail', 'Amazon', 'the Singapore International Arbitration Court', 'Amazon', 'CCI', 'Future Group', 'Amazon', 'Kishore Biyani', 'Future Group', 'Local”As India', 'Narendra Modi', 'Amazon', 'The U.S. Trade Representative', 'USTR', 'Mukesh Ambani', 'Reliance Industries', 'Jio Platforms', 'Reliance', 'Ambani', 'Indians’', 'Reliance', 'Jio Platforms', 'Reliance Retail', 'Raman Chima', 'Google', 'Android', 'Reliance', 'Reliance', 'Reliance', 'BJP', 'Ram Kadam', 'Amazon', 'Pratik Chorge/', 'Hindustan Times', 'Amazon', 'Amazon Prime Video', 'Bharatiya Janata Party', 'BJP', 'Amazon', 'Modi', 'The New York Times', 'Amazon', 'The Indian Supreme Court', 'Bezos', 'Amazon’s', 'Amazon', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Jeff Bezos', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/ULaCVNuvWu,2021-01-26T13:40:55,"10 VCs say interactivity, regulation and independent creators will reshape digital media in 2021","['The digital media industry will give us plenty to talk about this year.When we last surveyed venture capitalists about their media investments, the big topic was the impact that the pandemic would have on the industry, and on the prospects for new startups.Obviously, the pandemic hasn’t gone away, but when asked to predict the biggest storylines for 2021, VCs pointed to themes as varied as new distribution models, new kinds of interactivity, new tools for creators, the return of advertising business models and even the role of media in a democratic society.“We are headed toward a content universe where consumers’ power of choice grows to new heights — what premium content to consume and pay for, and how to consume it,” Javelin’s Alex Gurevich wrote. “The consumers will have the final choice! Not traditional media and content distribution companies.”For this new survey, we heard from 10 VCs — nine who invest in media startups, plus a tenth who’s seeing plenty of media pitches and was happy to share her thoughts. We asked them about the likelihood of further industry consolidation, whether we’ll see more digital media companies take the SPAC route and of course, what they’re looking for in their next investment.Here’s who we surveyed:Daniel Gulati, founding partner, Forecast FundAlex Gurevich, managing director, Javelin Venture PartnersMatthew Hartman, partner, Betaworks VenturesJerry Lu, senior associate, MaveronJana Messerschmidt, partner, Lightspeed Venture PartnersMichael Palank, general partner, MaC Venture Capital (with additional commentary from MaC’s Marlon Nichols)Pär-Jörgen Pärson, general partner, NorthzoneM.G. Siegler, general partner, GVLaurel Touby, managing director, Supernode VenturesHans Tung, managing partner, GGV CapitalRead their full responses below.What do you think will be the biggest trend or story in digital media in 2021?Daniel Gulati: Defining media’s role in a democratic society. What accountability exists when an individual company’s pursuit of scale leads to the spread of disinformation? When a platform’s terms of service appears to collide with constitutional rights, who makes the call and what happens? To what extent should governments support the viability of local media organizations in the face of global competition and a rapidly changing digital landscape?These are high stakes issues that will be front and center through the year.Alex Gurevich: The continued disruption of content distribution models, whether that’s the debundling of cable via the plethora of SVOD services, or the way new content is released (i.e., on-demand at home versus movie theaters). We are headed toward a content universe where consumers’ power of choice grows to new heights — what premium content to consume and pay for, and how to consume it. The consumers will have the final choice! Not traditional media and content distribution companies. The pandemic has greatly accelerated this trend.Matthew Hartman: The two largest social networks, Twitter and Facebook, removed the account of a sitting president and a set of related, follower accounts. This has fundamentally reset the media stack. This will accelerate action the government had already planned to take, including to reshape Section 230. The ripples will be felt throughout media, affecting how news is distributed through social media, what startups can use bigger platforms to grow, what the exit options are for small talent acquisitions and the fragmentation already occurring.Second, the rise of synthetic media. Algorithmically enhanced or created media is a shift we identified at Betaworks in 2018 and in 2021 it will only increase in scale and scope. Yes, this affects deep fake detection (with companies like Sensity.AI leading the way) and other nefarious uses — but it will also start to fundamentally reshape the way media is created, from the cost of animation to the cost of writing stories, to editing and creating CGI.Third, game streaming will continue to grow, with audiences that are starting to blow away those of regular TV. An enormous number of people tuned in last year to watch Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez play Among Us on Twitch with popular streamers (she hit 435,000 concurrent viewers at one point). And that wasn’t even close to the biggest event ever on Twitch, David Martinez, aka TheGrefg, hit 2.4 million concurrent viewers for the unveiling of his new Fortnite skin. Game publishers have finally started to understand the power of streamers not just to launch a new game, but to revive old ones, with games that groups of streamers can play together (like Among Us or Rust) soaring in popularity this past year.Jerry Lu: The emergence of interactive media platforms outside of just gaming.Because of their isolation due to COVID, people are yearning for social interaction and we’re seeing greater engagement across platforms like Twitch and Zoom, which make interactive communications possible. Previous iterations of media platforms were top-down broadcast, whereby companies produced content they thought consumers would like. Over the past five years, we’ve started to see a greater shift toward the long tail, whereby content comes straight from the consumer.Gaming and esports were at the forefront of this shift from passive content viewing to interactive entertainment experiences. I believe that 2021 will be the year when we see platforms beginning to embrace interactivity as a form of audience participation, blurring the line between viewer and active participant. I’m excited at the prospect of seeing this form of interactive content consumption applied to other sectors, like education, childcare and commerce, to name a few.Jana Messerschmidt: We will see a proliferation of products that enable content creators to build businesses outside of traditional media companies. These creators will leverage their existing brand, following and social media engagement to become entrepreneurs, building revenue streams across multiple different products.There are a plethora of new tools for creators: for writers (Substack, Medium), personalized video shoutouts from creators (Cameo*, PearPop), new audio platforms (LockerRoom*, Clubhouse) or all-in-one tools for creators that include merch, subscriptions, tipping and more (FourthWall* ). Now is the time for creators to be rewarded by their fans for their content creation.Historically, the big social platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Snap*, Twitter, TikTok) have failed to create meaningful paths for their creators to monetize. They make money from advertisers and thus their resources are focused on those advertising customer demands.denotes Lightspeed portfolio companyMichael Palank: If 2020 was the year every major media company either announced or grew their direct-to-consumer video/audio/gaming offering, 2021 will be the year where those offerings optimize and differentiate or die. We expect the hunger for original content to continue, but we feel the type of content will continue to diversify from both a story and IP perspective and a format perspective. It is not unthinkable that a major media company like Apple, Amazon or Disney looks to acquire Clubhouse in 2021.As the lines between video games and filmed entertainment continue to blur we can also envision new companies popping up to take advantage of this trend. I also feel these content platforms will need to differentiate by way of better discovery and personalization.I fully expect every major media company from Disney to Apple to Amazon to Microsoft will be looking for new and innovative ways to separate themselves from the rest of the pack in 2021.Marlon Nichols: I think that the continued creation of streaming platforms from content creators/owners (e.g., Disney+, HBO Max, etc.) will force downward subscription pricing adjustments across the board and streaming platforms will need to revisit advertising as a revenue stream. That said, we know that watching ads on a paid platform won’t fly with consumers so I believe we’ll see contextually relevant product placement become the accepted form of brand/content collaboration going forward. I led MaC’s investment into Ryff because of this thesis.Pär-Jörgen Pärson: Institutions and legislators will have a big effect on social media platforms. I think there will be pushes on antitrust behavior, and social networks will have to behave like media — meaning that they also need to take responsibility for the content that’s on their platform, not only from a user agreement standpoint like today but from an editorial standpoint. I think we’ll see many more editors-in-chief in this industry, as editorial becomes more and more important in our polarized world. This has the potential to change the social media platform landscape quite dramatically, and I’m not entirely sure yet on the long-term impact commercially.M.G. Siegler: It’s sort of boring, but I wouldn’t be shocked if we see a swing back toward advertising-based models. I think there are two parts to this: First, if and when the pandemic recedes, I think a lot of traditional big advertising players like travel, will come roaring back. Second, it feels like there’s been a move away from advertising to paid subscriptions for a while now and I think these things are cyclical.To be clear, I think both will continue to exist, I just think that after years of underindexing on paid subs, now we’re perhaps on the verge of overindexing on it … Obviously, advertising never went away, I just think it may be due for a bit of a renaissance (though I say that hoping the powers that be make those ads a better user experience — I think that’s the only way there’s not another backlash against them).Laurel Touby: The biggest trend in digital media will be companies that don’t call themselves media companies, but that clearly draw from the business model playbook of media companies. For example: Companies that monetize their communities by giving sponsors and advertisers access to their audiences; or technology startups that sell wearable products and upsell their customers with access to premium high-value content.Hans Tung:\xa0Contextual social networks: Video and livestreaming with the likes of TikTok and with other players like Instagram and Snap will continue to drive creativity and engagement. Clubhouse is now garnering a lot of attention as audio captures the attention of a new generation. This also creates new opportunities for established audio players like YY or Ximalaya. At the same time, apps like Clubhouse are an evolution of Snap or Twitter where influencers of all sorts gather to build a new following on new platforms.However, one of the most interesting things we’re seeing is the emergence of contextual social networks that are focused on solving real-life problems. We see a lot more companies taking the best of audio and video experiences and experimenting with the next iteration of apps like Headspace and Calm, to solve societal issues, personal issues such as how to deal with anxiety, etc. These social networks may not scale as quickly or grab headlines like Clubhouse but they’re designed to bring people together to solve problems. We are also seeing professionalized networks such as Valence or Chief use these audio/video networks to address issues for a particular gender or underrepresented group, or apps that create virtual networking for communities.Digital media delivered with differentiated experiences: Peloton may not immediately jump to mind as a digital-media company but they are one of the best at producing a high-value experience using extremely high-quality content that goes far beyond simple fitness or even the need for hardware. Increasingly more categories will become “Netflix-ized” where content is king and the experience is delivered through your smartphone.As with Peloton, the experience is further enhanced with social interaction, such as leader boards, access to the best instructors, etc., which in turn expands the reach of the content. It’s a powerful loop that is driven by quality content, and the components feed off each other to make it more accessible. If you then couple it with Affirm to make it more affordable, you’ve got a flywheel on steroids. This pattern will emerge in other categories.Consumerization of enterprise communication: Another aspect of media is communication, which we are seeing evolve in the enterprise space. It started with Slack a few years ago and Zoom more recently. Now with companies like Yak or the emergence of various conference apps, we see a higher usage frequency between companies, companies and their customers, and within the enterprise itself.How much time are you spending looking at media startups right now?']",Span,"['Aleksandar Nakic', 'Alex Gurevich', 'SPAC', 'Daniel Gulati', 'Forecast FundAlex Gurevich', 'Javelin Venture PartnersMatthew Hartman', 'Betaworks VenturesJerry Lu', 'MaveronJana Messerschmidt', 'MaC Venture Capital', 'MaC’s', 'Jörgen Pärson', 'NorthzoneM.G.

https://t.co/3CC8Pvi46S,2021-01-26T13:30:23,"LA-based Sidecar Health’s low-cost, cash-pay health insurance service is now valued at $1 billion","['Meet Sidecar Health, the newest member of the tech industry’s billion dollar healthcare startup club.The valuation comes thanks to $125 million in new funding that the company will use to expand its new model for health insurance. Sidecar Health’s insurance plans give consumers the ability to pay directly for care — often at steep discounts to the prices that patients would be charged through traditional insurance plans.A typical Sidecar Health plan costs $240 per-member, per-month and its flexibility has made it a popular choice for the nation’s 20 million to 30 million uninsured individuals, according to chief executive officer Patrick Quigley.The core of Sidecar’s plan is an ability to offer its policy holders the ability to pay directly for their medical care — and shop around to find the best provider using pricing information that the company provides through its mobile app.Sidecar’s app provides real-time, geo-located information on the costs of any number of medical procedures, consultations, or drugs — and allows its users to shop at the places that offer them the best deal — in some cases the company will even pay money back if a price-savvy healthcare shopper finds a better deal.If this all sounds kind of dystopian and nightmarish — well, welcome to the world of American healthcare!In an ideal world, low-cost medical care would be a right, not a privilege and a baseline level of healthcare access would be available to everyone — including an ability to pay a set price for drugs, consultations and treatment. But if you live in America, bargain hunting for care may be the best bet to curb skyrocketing healthcare costs — at least for now.While Sidecar pitches its service for everyone, the average age of the company’s current patient population is 33 years-old, Quigley said. \xa0“It’s typically people that earn more than $45,000 a year and less than $75,000,” said Quigley of the company’s demographics.The way it works is that Sidecar issues its insured members what’s basically a debit card that they use to pay for care, prescriptions, and consultations directly. The money comes from Sidecar’s claims accounts and is paid directly to doctors. By avoiding the middleman (traditional insurance companies), Sidecar can reduce overhead for care providers who like to get paid directly and will offer discounts in exchange for receiving cash in hand.“It is 40% cheaper than the traditional commercial insurance companies would pay,” said Quigley.Sidecar covers around 170,000 medical conditions and procedures, according to Quigley — including things from horse therapy (it’s a thing) for anxiety relief to heart transplants and chemotherapy, Quigley said.Sidecar is currently available in 16 states and hopes to expand to most of the country on the back of its latest round of funding.And while the company is working with uninsured patient populations now, it’s hoping to also expand its footprint with government-backed healthcare plans and into employer-sponsored health insurance as well.It’s still early days for the service, which has only been around through two open enrollment periods for would-be plan members to sign up. And while the company doesn’t disclose its membership figures, Quigley said it would end the year above 30,000 members. “It’s still super early,” Quigley said.\xa0Despite the stage of the business, investors are convinced that the business model has an opportunity to transform health insurance in the US.\xa0 “The extraordinary level of transparency Sidecar Health brings to the marketplace has the\xa0 potential to fundamentally change how millions of Americans shop for healthcare,” said Molly\xa0 Bonakdarpour, a partner at the Drive Capital, which provided early backing for the company. “We think Sidecar Health’s team of consumer,\xa0 technology and healthcare veterans is well positioned to capitalize on the large healthcare\xa0 insurtech opportunity.”\xa0For the latest round, Drive Capital was joined by new investors including BOND, Tiger Global and Menlo Ventures, according to a statement.Sidecar Health will use the investment to expand its geographic footprint, grow its team and\xa0 invest in new insurance products that build on its success in the uninsured market. The first of\xa0 these will be an ACA or “Obamacare” offering for 2022, followed by a product for the self funded employer market.\xa0“We believe we can take $1 trillion in waste out of the U.S. healthcare system,” Quigley said.\xa0']",EdgeQ,"['Sidecar Health’s', 'Sidecar Health’s', 'Li-Anne Dias', 'Sidecar Health’s', 'Sidecar Health', 'Patrick Quigley', 'Sidecar', 'Sidecar’s', 'Sidecar', 'Quigley', 'Quigley', 'Sidecar', 'Sidecar’s', 'Sidecar', 'Quigley', 'Quigley', 'Quigley', 'Sidecar', 'Quigley', 'Quigley', 'Sidecar Health', 'Molly', 'the Drive Capital', 'Sidecar Health’s', 'Drive Capital', 'BOND', 'Tiger Global', 'Menlo Ventures', 'Sidecar Health', 'ACA', 'Quigley', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Sidecar Health’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/OqMrko2jVt,2021-01-26T13:00:55,"Span, the smart fusebox replacement founded by an ex-Tesla engineer, gets an Alexa upgrade","['Automating and controlling devices and energy usage in homes has potentially become a bit easier thanks to an integration between Span, the startup making a digital fusebox replacement, and \xa0Amazon’s voice recognition interface, Alexa.The integration also comes with a $20 million new cash infusion from Amazon’s Alexa Fund and the massive insurance company Munich Re Ventures’ HSB Fund.Through the Alexa integration, homeowners using Span’s electrical panels can turn on or off any circuit or appliance in their home, monitor which appliances are using power, and determine which electrical source is generating the most power for a home.Questions like “Alexa, ask Span what is consuming the most power right now?” will get a response. The Alexa integration opens up new opportunities for home owners to integrate their devices and appliances, because of the connection to the home’s wiring, according to Span chief executive, Arch Rao.Rao sees the Alexa integration as a way for Span to become the home automation hub that tech companies have been promising for a long time. “There are far too many devices in the home today… with too many apps,” Rao said. “The advantage we have is, once installed, we’re persistent in the home and connected to everything electric in the home for the next 30 to 40 years.”In addition to monitoring energy usage and output, Alexa commands could turn off the power for any device or switch that a homeowner has programmed into the system.“The most material way to state it is, our panel is providing a virtual interface to the home in the build environment,” said Rao. “We’re building a very capable edge device… it becomes sort of a true aggregation point and nerve center to give you real-time visibility and control.”Going forward, Rao envisions Span integrating with other devices like water sensors, fire alarm sensors, and other equipment to provide other types of controls that could be useful for insurers like Munich Re.With the $20 million that the company raised, Rao intends to significantly increase sales and marketing efforts working through partners like Munich Re and Amazon to get Span’s devices into as many homes as possible.The company has significant tailwinds thanks to home automation and energy efficiency upgrade efforts that are now wending their way through Washington, but could mean subsidies for the deployment of technology’s like Span’s electric panels.\xa0Rao also intends to boost headcount at Span. The company currently has 35 employees and Rao would like to see that number double to roughly 70 by the end of the year.Span’s growth is part of a broad movement in home technologies toward increasingly sustainable options. In many cases that’s the penetration of electrical appliances in things like water heaters and stove tops, but also the integration of electric vehicle charging stations, home energy storage units, and other devices that push energy generation and management to the edge of electricity grids.“It’s cutting that pipe that’s bringing natural gas to the home and bringing all electric everything… as consumers are continuing to cut the cord on fossils, your existing home system is not efficient. That’s one ecosystem of products where we are starting to see partnership opportunities,” Rao said. “When it comes to applications like monitoring the health of your appliances… and services to the home. Having the data that we provide will be unprecedented.”']",Opal,"['Alexa', 'NavigationClose', 'Alexa', 'CommentAutomating', 'Span', 'Amazon’s', 'Alexa', 'Amazon’s', 'Alexa Fund', 'Munich Re Ventures', 'HSB Fund', 'Alexa', 'Span’s', 'Alexa', 'Span', 'Alexa', 'Span', 'Arch Rao', 'Rao', 'Alexa', 'Span', 'Rao', 'Alexa', 'Rao', 'Rao', 'Span', 'Munich Re', 'Rao', 'Munich Re', 'Amazon', 'Span’s', 'Span’s', 'Span', 'Rao', 'Span’s', 'Rao', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Alexa', 'Shieber2:00', 'Span', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/eNfL0wxAU4,2021-01-26T13:00:31,EdgeQ reveals more details behind its next-gen 5G/AI chip,"['5G is the current revolution in wireless technology, and every chip company old and new is trying to burrow their way into this ultra-competitive — but extremely lucrative — market. One of the most interesting new players in the space is EdgeQ, a startup with a strong technical pedigree via Qualcomm that we covered last year after it raised a nearly $40 million Series A.EdgeQ raises $51 million to fuse AI compute and 5G within a single chipThe company has been quite stealthy about its technology as it works on its design (its website as I write this literally says “Welcome to WordPress. This is your first post. Edit or delete it, then start writing!”), but today, the company revealed more details for the first time (and\xa0also updated their website).The most interesting facet of its system-on-a-chip (SoC) design is that it is based on RISC-V. Unlike processor architectures like x86 and Arm, RISC-V is open-source, and one of the first open architectures to reach any sort of enduring popularity and ecosystem. That’s led to a bunch of new companies building on top of it, including now EdgeQ and also SiFive, which we covered late last year.Vinay Ravuri, EdgeQ’s founder and CEO, explained that the use of RISC-V allows EdgeQ to offer chips with the flexibility of reprogrammable processors known as FPGAs while also offering a more cohesive and integrated product with better power savings. In his view, that’s been one of the big challenges in the wireless communications market to date with the rollout of 5G.“When you are in a closed system, it compacts nicely, and everything matches,” he said, pointing to market leaders like Huawei and Ericsson whose vertically-integrated base stations are widely deployed throughout the world. The problem is that customers feel stifled by having all of their equipment come from one, irreplaceable vendor. Meanwhile, with a purely open system based on standards like OpenRAN, “you get a clunky solution” that’s cobbled together from off-the-shelf parts. That leads to increased power consumption since the components in these boxes were never faithfully designed to be used together.Ravuri says that EdgeQ stands in the middle between open and closed, offering an extensible system that is also integrated and may save, in some instances, up to 50% of the power demand for a wireless base station. The key is combining machine learning into wireless communications through a better SoC and having all the parts work seamlessly together. “The uniqueness of the communications chips is in the algorithms,” he said. “You are not selling sand, you are not connecting gates and saying this is a processor. You are connecting gates and here is an algorithm for the physical layer of communications.”EdgeQ founder and CEO Vinay Ravuri. Photo via EdgeQ.Adil Kidwai, who is VP and head of product at EdgeQ, said that “Under the hood, it is hardware instructions that are controlled by software … It’s a ‘soft’ modem with very low power consumption.” Since EdgeQ is based on RISC-V, the existing toolchain available in that ecosystem also applies to the company’s product, allowing engineers to use compilers and debuggers that have been built for RISC-V. Ravuri noted that EdgeQ has added about 50 to 100 of its own vector extensions to the base RISC-V implementation to optimize performance.With the product’s design more firmly established, he said that the company is looking to sample its system with customers in the first half of this year. “Once we sample, there is a productization cycle that customers take,” he said, and he intends to be starting revenue growth by 2022. The EdgeQ base station is compatible according to the company with OpenRAN option 7.x and option 6.The company also noted for the first time today that Paul Jacobs, the former CEO of Qualcomm, and Matt Grob, the company’s former CTO, have both joined EdgeQ’s advisory board in an official capacity. The two met Ravuri back when he was at Qualcomm and have been in touch throughout EdgeQ’s development.']",Rhino,"['NavigationClose', 'AI', 'PAU BARRENA', 'Getty Images5G', 'AI', 'WordPress', 'Vinay Ravuri', 'Huawei', 'Ericsson', 'Ravuri', 'Vinay Ravuri', 'EdgeQ.Adil Kidwai', 'Paul Jacobs', 'Qualcomm', 'Matt Grob', 'CTO', 'Ravuri', 'Qualcomm', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/TIN7sugyBT,2021-01-26T13:00:19,Opal raises $4.3 million for its ‘digital well-being’ assistant for iPhone,"['Many people want to develop better screen-time habits, but don’t have a good set of tools to do so. A new startup, Opal, aims to help. The company, now backed by $4.3 million in seed funding, has developed a digital well-being assistant for iOS that allows you to block distracting websites and apps, set schedules around app usage, lock down apps for stricter and more focused quiet periods, and more.The service works by way of a VPN system that limits your access to apps and sites. But unlike some VPNs on the market, Opal is committed to not collecting any personal data on its users or their private browsing data. Instead, its business model is based on paid subscriptions, not selling user data, it says.Timed with its public debut, Opal also today announced its initial financing in a round led by Nicolas Wittenborn at Adjacent, a mobile-focused VC fund. Other investors included Harry Stebbings, Steve Schlafman, Alex Zubillaga, Kevin Carter, Thibaud Elziere, Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve, Alban Denoyel, Isai, Secocha Ventures, Speedinvest, and others.Image Credits: Opal, founder Kenneth SchlenkerThe idea for Opal comes from Paris-based Kenneth Schlenker, a longtime technologist who previously founded and sold an art marketplace startup ArtList and later led mobility company Bird’s expansion in France.Schlenker, who grew up in a small, quiet village in the Alps, says he got into technology at a young age.“I sort of got obsessed, like many of us, by the potential of technology and its amazing power of attraction — making connections, learning new things, all sorts of incredible opportunities,” he explains. “But I’ve then spent the last 10 years and more trying to seek a balance between this need for connection and this need for disconnection.”In more recent years, Schlenker came to realize that others were having the same problem, including those outside the tech industry. That drove him to build Opal, with the goal of helping people better achieve balance in their lives so they could reconnect with loved ones, spend time in nature or just generally go offline to focus on other areas of their lives.At a basic level, Opal’s VPN allows users to block themselves from using dozens of distracting apps and sites for certain periods of time, including social media, news, productivity apps and more.Social media, in particular, has been a huge problem in recent years, Schlenker says.“In particular, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter — social media is where you feel like you’re learning something, and you feel like you’re connecting with people. So it’s good. But on the other hand, it’s very hard to stay intentional,” he explains. “It’s okay to pick up your phone and go to Instagram, but when you ‘wake up’ 30 minutes later, you usually feel really bad. You feel like, ‘where’s the time gone?’, ‘what did I just do?,’ ” he says.Opal addresses this problem through a handful of features.Image Credits: OpalThe free service allows you to block distracting websites and apps and take breaks throughout the day. By upgrading to the paid membership, Opal users can schedule time off from apps to establish recurring downtimes — whether that’s for family dinners or working hours, or anything else. They also can use a more extreme version of this feature called Focus Mode, which locks you out of apps in a way that’s not cancelable.While the company is using a VPN to make this system work, it’s being transparent and straightforward about its data collection practices.“There is zero private browsing data that leaves your phone,” Schlenker insists. “Anything you do on your phone outside of Opal’s app stays local on your phone and is never stored on any of our servers or any other servers. That’s very important to us,” he says.From inside Opal’s app, the company claims it only collects usability and crash information — not browsing data. And the usability data is completely anonymized for another layer of privacy. Opal also doesn’t require an email to begin using the app. It only asks for one if you choose to pay.Image Credits: Opal\xa0These core principles are also documented on Opal’s privacy page, and are why Schlenker believes his app won’t face the challenges that other screen-time apps on the App Store have experienced in the past.As you may recall, Apple cracked down on the screen time app industry a couple of years ago — a move Apple said was focused on protecting user privacy, but has also been raised as a possible example of anticompetitive behavior. Many of the apps at the time had been using techniques Apple claimed put consumers’ privacy and security at risk, as they gave third-parties elevated access to users’ devices. This was particularly concerning because many of the impacted apps were marketed as parental control services — meaning the end users were often children.Opal, meanwhile, is targeting adults, and perhaps teenagers, who want to develop better screen-time habits. It is not selling this as a parental control system, however.Image Credits: OpalAt launch, Opal can block over 100 apps and sites across several categories, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, Gmail, Outlook, Slack, Robinhood, WhatsApp, WeChat and others, including those in the news, adult and gambling categories.Users can choose to block the apps for short breaks — 5, 10 or 60 minutes — throughout the day. You can also set an intention and set a timer before using an app, to help you avoid the issue of losing track of time. And you can set focus timers or scheduled times to automatically shut off app usage.You can track your progress by viewing the “time saved” and you can share your successes across social media. In time, Schlenker plans to add more of a scoring mechanism to Opal that will help you stay accountable to your original goals.Image Credits: OpalThough work on the app only began in 2020, Opal began attracting attention as it publicized its plans on Twitter and ran its private beta, which grew from hundreds to thousands of users this year, saving its users an average of two hours per day.Though Schlenker had connections with many of the angel investors who have since backed Opal, he says the interest from institutional and larger investors was all inbound.“It was not our intention to raise so much, so early,” Schlenker notes.The funds will be used to help Opal grow its team, particularly engineering, design as well as product. The company will also soon launch a version of Opal for Chrome and later, Android, and will experiment with more social features around sharing and hosting group sessions.The app is currently a free download on the App Store with an optional $59.99/year subscription plan.\xa0']",CrediBook,"['iPhone', 'NavigationClose ScreenOpal', 'Opal', 'VPN', 'Opal', 'Timed', 'Opal', 'Nicolas Wittenborn', 'VC', 'Harry Stebbings', 'Steve Schlafman', 'Alex Zubillaga', 'Kevin Carter', 'Thibaud Elziere', 'Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve', 'Alban Denoyel', 'Secocha Ventures', 'Kenneth SchlenkerThe', 'Opal', 'Kenneth Schlenker', 'ArtList', 'Bird', 'Schlenker', 'Schlenker', 'Schlenker', 'Opal', 'Focus Mode', 'VPN', 'Schlenker', 'Schlenker', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'TikTok', 'YouTube', 'Twitch, Gmail, Outlook', 'Slack, Robinhood', 'WhatsApp', 'WeChat', 'Schlenker', 'Opal', 'Schlenker', 'Opal', 'Schlenker', 'Opal', 'Android', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Opal', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/DQRdGPhsLL,2021-01-26T13:00:13,Rhino raises $95M to scale its rental deposit replacing insurance product,"['Rhino today announced that it has raised $95 million, an investment that values the startup at just under $500 million. Tiger Global led the round, an investment that Rhino described as “pre-IPO” to TechCrunch.Rhino provides an insurance product to real estate companies, allowing them to forgo traditional rental deposits from tenants, and offering renters an insurance product that provides similar utility for a regular fee.As part of its funding news, Rhino disclosed that its contracted ARR has scaled quickly in recent years, from $4 million in January 2019 to $60 million in January 2021. The ARR figure represents the amount of expected customer volume from buildings that Rhino has contracted with. The company’s co-founder and chairman Ankur Jain described the number as conservative in a phone call with TechCrunch.TechCrunch spoke with Jain, who is also the CEO of Kairos, a brand portfolio that includes the insurance startup, about its new investment. Kairos, Jain said, wants to lower costs for younger generations. Rhino fits that goal as upfront costs for renting can be prohibitive and its service could make the process less dependent on renters having lots of cash that they can lock up for the period of their lease.Jain described Rhino as something that can help landlords and renters by lowering the barrier to renting a unit, thus widening the potential customer pool. More possible customers, the logic goes, the more units that may be rented.The economics of the business appear favorable for Rhino. Jain told TechCrunch that COVID-19 did not push the economics — the contribution margin of its core insurance product — negative. Given how we’ve seen some high-growth insurance products post histories of negative contribution margins, Rhino appears to be in good health. (TechCrunch confirmed that this result was inclusive of loss-adjustment expenses.)AgentSync lands consecutive rounds as insurtech boomsSufficient health to take it public in time? Perhaps. Jain told TechCrunch that its new lead investor Tiger has lots of experience taking companies public, something that his company might pursue in 12 to 24 months.Given the climate, we asked the SPAC question. The CEO said that traditional IPO was more the goal.If you are surprised to see the CEO of a yet-startup talk about going public so honestly, recall that Lemonade went public in mid-2020 with modest revenues to great effect. Another neo-insurance provider, Root, also went public though it has lost ground since. MetroMile, yet another player in the world of startups offering insurance products, intends to list via a SPAC.And more startups are working on related problems.

The capital will be used for product launches and expansion into more Indonesian cities.Founded in February 2020, CrediBook is part of a wave of startups focused on digitizing small- to medium-sized businesses in Indonesia. SMEs contribute more than 60% of the country’s gross domestic product, but many still use traditional bookkeeping systems like paper ledgers. Digitizing them makes it easier for them to use services like online invoicing and payments, and keep financial records to apply for working capital loans.Some other startups serving Indonesian SMEs include BukuKas and BukuWarung, two digital bookkeeping apps for small B2C businesses like neighborhood stores and restaurants (both have also recently raised funding). Moka and Jurnal, meanwhile, are used by larger companies. CrediBook is carving out a niche for itself by serving small-to-medium sized B2B businesses in the retail sector, including wholesalers.Co-founder and chief executive officer Gabriel Frans told TechCrunch that the company is moving toward a profitable business model and currently has more than 500,000 customers, who use the app for bookkeeping, tracking orders from retailers and digital payments. CrediBook also works with financial services provider PayFazz, one of its seed investors, to provide financing to SMEs.Frans said CrediBook plans to add more features, including online invoicing, to create an end-to-end platform like Tel Aviv and New York-based B2B payment startups Melio, which announced a round of funding this week that brought its valuation to $1.3 billion. “We are digitizing not only the bookkeeping, but also the invoicing and payment processing,” Frans said.Melio raises $110M on a $1.3B valuation to bring B2B payments for SMBs into the 21st centuryMost of CrediBook’s customers are currently concentrated in the cities of Jabodetabek and Bandung, and part of its funding will be used for building its user base in more areas. Frans said many of the startup’s customers relied on paper ledgers before signing up for CrediBook, so part of the process of convincing them to go online includes demonstrating how having more visibility into their finances can grow their businesses.“We are very close to our users because this is a very localized market,” said Frans, who previously worked at O2O platform Kudo (now called GrabKios after its acquisition by Grab in 2017) and bookings platform Traveloka. “I was already familiar with the industry based on my previous experience, and if they try our app and experience the benefit of how it will make their day-to-day problems less, they will love it.”Payfazz gets $53 million to give more Indonesians access to financial services']",Fleksy,"['NavigationClose', 'Shu@catherineshu', 'Wavemaker Partners', 'Alpha JWC Ventures', 'Insignia Ventures Partners', 'CrediBook', 'BukuKas', 'BukuWarung', 'CrediBook', 'Gabriel Frans', 'CrediBook', 'Melio', 'SMBs', 'CrediBook', 'Jabodetabek', 'CrediBook', 'Kudo', 'Grab', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCAsiaCrediBookdigital', 'Wavemaker Partners', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/hIHCVQgdsn,2021-01-26T10:26:38,Fleksy adds an art marketplace to spice up its keyboard app,"['Fleksy, an autocorrecting AI keyboard which competes with big-guns like Google’s Gboard and Microsoft’s Swiftkey, has a new way to catch users’ eyes: Art keyboards.It’s just launched FleksyArt: A marketplace for artists to sell digital works to its users so they can customize the look of their keyboards.Fleksy has had keyboard themes before. But the art marketplace aims to go further — opening its platform up to all sorts of artists to digitally distribute work to its “millions” of users for display on a piece of essential smartphone real-estate (it points out the keyboard is the second most used app on phones, after all).As this is keyboard art, the illustrations and artworks appear with the letters of Fleksy’s keyboard overlaid. So the startup warns legibility is important. Clearly some designs are going to work better than others. But beyond that the creative sky is the limit.A collage of some of the different artworks available on the FleksyArt marketplace (Image credit: Fleksy)FleksyArt is starting with several digital artists onboard, including María Picasso i Piquer, Lucila Dominguez, URKO and Maru Ceballos.It’s inviting other artists to sign up by submitting a portfolio of work for review here.Victoria Gerchinhoren, Fleksy’s chief design officer, explains how it works: “When we receive the portfolios, my design team approves for having the artwork in our marketplace,” she tells us, noting Fleksy has already handpicked a few artists to get the ball rolling. “I send them guidelines on how to prepare the assets and I write the last specs before publishing inside the product.”“There defined guidelines in terms of the number of pieces (always packs of 2-4 themes) and artists can create as many packs as they want. We suggest the pieces inside each pack have a connection, they can be connected by an idea or style,” she goes on.“We publish the packs in a dedicated section in the host app (which we redesigned with this in mind not long ago) then communicate in social media. We’ve also just launched the website section with interviews and the artist profiles and bios so they have a nice place to be showcased.”Fleksy is setting a flat price of €2.99 for all art packs — in order that artists selling on the marketplace “have the same price and competition is fair”, as Gerchinhoren puts it.It’s doing a 50:50 revenue split on sales — after Google’s 30% commission has been factored in. So this means that Google gets €0.89 per sale, and the artist and Fleksy then split the rest.Fleksy has also confirmed that artists retain copyright of their works.“We’re setting this collaboration on a revenue-share model,” it notes on its website. “You’ll receive 50% of the revenue after Google’s 30% commission.

https://t.co/pBrHMqbgzw,2021-01-26T09:15:00,Grindr on the hook for €10M over GDPR consent violations,"['Grindr, a gay, bi, trans and queer hook-up app, is on the hook for a penalty of NOK100,000,000 (aka €10M or ~$12.1M) in Europe.Norway’s data protection agency has announced it’s notified the US-based company of its intention to issue the fine in relation to consent violations under the region’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which sets out strict conditions for processing people’s data.The size of the fine is notable. GDPR allows for fines to scale up to 4% of global annual turnover or up to €20M, whichever is higher. In this case Grindr is on the hook for around 10% of its annual revenue, per the DPA. (Although the sanction is not yet final; Grindr has until February 15 to submit a response before the Datatilsynet issues a final decision.)“We have notified Grindr that we intend to impose a fine of high magnitude as our findings suggest grave violations of the GDPR,” said Bjørn Erik Thon, DG of the agency, in a statement. “Grindr has 13.7 million active users, of which thousands reside in Norway. Our view is that these people have had their personal data shared unlawfully. An important objective of the GDPR is precisely to prevent take-it-or-leave-it ‘consents’. It is imperative that such practices cease.”Grindr has been contacted for comment. Update: The company has sent the below statement. It also pointed us to a recent blog post, written by Shane Wiley, its chief privacy officer, in which he denies it shares “precise” location data with advertisers, nor users’ age or gender. But it does share the ad ID of the device they’re using, as well as the IP Address, plus additional device details (including make, model and OS version).Here’s Grindr’s statement:Grindr is a social movement and a cultural phenomenon. Our goal is to create the leading social and digital media platform that enables the LGBTQ+ community and other users to discover, share and navigate the world around them. Grindr is confident that our approach to user privacy is first-in-class among social applications with detailed consent flows, transparency, and control provided to all of our users.\xa0 For example, Grindr has retained valid legal consent from ALL of our EEA users on multiple occasions. We most recently required all users to provide consent (again) in late 2020 to align with the GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) version 2 which was developed by the IAB EU in consultation with the UK ICO.The allegations from the Norwegian Data Protection Authority date back to 2018 and do not reflect Grindr’s current Privacy Policy or practices. We continually enhance our privacy practices in consideration of evolving privacy laws and regulations, and look forward to entering into a productive dialogue with the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.Last year a report by Norway’s Consumer Council (NCC) delved into the data sharing practices of a number of popular apps in categories such as dating and fertility. It found the majority of apps transmitted data to “unexpected third parties”, with users not clearly informed how their information was being used.Grindr was one of the apps featured in the NCC report. And the Council went on to file a complaint against the app with the national DPA, claiming unlawful sharing of users’ personal data with third parties for marketing purposes — including GPS location; user profile data; and the fact the user in question is on Grindr.Dating and fertility apps among those snitching to ‘out of control’ ad tech, report findsUnder the GDPR, an app user’s personal data may be legally shared if you obtain their consent to do so. However there are a set of clear standards for consent to be legal — meaning it must be informed, specific and freely given. The Datatilsynet found that Grindr had failed to meet this standard.\xa0It said users of Grindr were forced to accept the privacy policy in its entirety — and were not asked if they wanted to consent with the sharing of their data to third parties.Additionally, it said sexual orientation could be inferred by a user’s presence on Grindr; and under regional law such sensitive ‘special category’ data carries an even higher standard of explicit consent before it can be shared (which, again, the Datatilsynet said Grindr failed to get from users).“Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr needs consent to share these personal data and that Grindr’s consents were not valid. Additionally, we believe that the fact that someone is a Grindr user speaks to their sexual orientation, and therefore this constitutes special category data that merit particular protection,” it writes in a press release.“The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that this is a serious case,” added Thon. “Users were not able to exercise real and effective control over the sharing of their data. Business models where users are pressured into giving consent, and where they are not properly informed about what they are consenting to, are not compliant with the law.”The decision could have wider significance as a similar ‘forced consent’ complaint against Facebook is still open on the desk of Ireland’s data protection watchdog — despite being filed back in May 2018. For tech giants that have have set up a regional base in Ireland, and made an Irish entity legally responsible for processing EU citizens’ data, GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism has led to considerable delays in complaint enforcement.Grindr, meanwhile, changed how it obtains consent in April 2020 — and the proposed sanction deals with how it was handling this prior to then, from May 2018, when the GDPR came into force.“We have not to date assessed whether the subsequent changes comply with the GDPR,” the Datatilsynet adds.Commenting on the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s action in a statement, Monique Goyens, DG of European consumer rights organization Beuc, said:\xa0“This is excellent news and sends a clear signal that it’s illegal to monitor consumers 24/7, without their consent, to collect and share their data. The GDPR does have teeth and consumer groups stand ready to act against those who break the law.“We commend the Norwegian data protection authority for acting swiftly. It is reassuring that GDPR complaints do not have to linger on for years. Too many apps gather and share too much personal data with too many third parties for commercial purposes based on the same flimsy grounds and with no control. This move by the Norwegian authority will reverberate across the entire adtech industry — and hopefully bring some change.”Grindr sold by Chinese owner after US raised national security concernsAfter its report last year, the NCC also filed complaints against five of the third parties who it found to be receiving data from Grindr: MoPub (owned by Twitter), Xandr (formerly known as AppNexus), OpenX Software, AdColony, and Smaato. The DPA notes that those cases are ongoing.Following the NCC report in January 2020, Twitter told us it had suspended Grindr’s MoPub account while it investigated the “sufficiency” of its consent mechanism. We’ve reached out to Twitter to ask whether it ever reinstated the account and will update this report with any response.Update:\xa0A Twitter spokesperson confirmed it had reversed the suspension after Grindr made changes to its processes, telling us: “After a thorough investigation, Grindr made changes in order to meet MoPub’s partner requirements that ensure they have the appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure consumer transparency around data collection and use.”\xa0European privacy campaign group noyb, which was involved in filing the strategic complaints against Grindr and the adtech companies, hailed the DPA’s decision to uphold the complaints — dubbing the size of the fine “enormous” (given Grindr only reported profits of just over $30M in 2019, meaning it’s facing losing about a third of that at one fell swoop).noyb also argues that Grindr’s switch to trying to claim legitimate interests to continue processing users’ data without obtaining their consent could result in further penalties for the company.\xa0“This is in conflict with the decision of the Norwegian DPA, as it explicitly held that “any extensive disclosure … for marketing purposes should be based on the data subject’s consent“,” writes Ala Krinickytė, data protection lawyer at\xa0noyb, in a statement. “The case is clear from the factual and legal side. We do not expect any successful objection by Grindr. However, more fines may be in the pipeline for Grindr as it lately claims an unlawful ‘legitimate interest’ to share user data with third parties — even without consent. Grindr may be bound for a second round.”\xa0While Grindr has sought to dismiss the DPA’s “allegations”, as out of date, the reference in its statement to obtaining consent under the IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) does not look entirely risk-free either — given the mechanism is itself subject to GDPR complaint proceedings.Last year a preliminary finding by the Belgian DPA concluded that the TCF did not meet the required GDPR standard. A final decision is pending after a hearing in front of its litigation chamber.A security flaw in Grindr let anyone easily hijack user accountsThis report was updated with comment from Beuc and Twitter, and with a statement from Grindr plus some additional related context']",Remagine,"['Grindr', 'GDPR', 'NavigationClose', 'GDPR', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Leon Neal', 'window)Grindr', 'NOK100,000,000', 'Norway’s', 'General Data Protection Regulation', 'Grindr', 'DPA', 'Grindr', 'Datatilsynet', 'Grindr', 'Bjørn Erik Thon', 'Grindr', 'GDPR', 'Shane Wiley', 'the IP Address', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'EEA', 'Consent Framework', 'the IAB EU', 'the Norwegian Data Protection Authority', 'Grindr', 'the Norwegian Data Protection Authority', 'Norway’s Consumer Council', 'Grindr', 'NCC', 'DPA', 'Grindr', 'Datatilsynet', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'Datatilsynet', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'Norwegian Data Protection Authority', 'EU', 'GDPR’s', 'Grindr', 'Datatilsynet', 'the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s', 'Monique Goyens', 'Beuc', 'NCC', 'Grindr', 'MoPub', 'Xandr', 'AppNexus', 'AdColony', 'DPA', 'NCC', 'Twitter', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'MoPub’s', 'Grindr', 'DPA', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'the Norwegian DPA', 'Ala Krinickytė', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'Grindr', 'DPA', 'Consent Framework', 'TCF', 'Beuc', 'Grindr', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CouncilnoybprivacyGrindr', 'GDPR', 'NOK100,000,000', 'Norway’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The Berlin-based startup has been operating in stealth mode, but already has 20 clients under its former brand name ‘Get Conscious Growth’. Its backers include former Global Head of Google Payment Jonathan Weiner and former COO of Venmo Michael Vaughn. Remagine’s lead investor is unmade but Techcrunch understands it comprises largely of debt financing.The fintech will specialize in offering revenue-based financing for high-growth and impact-led businesses, which tends to be more founder-friendly than equity or debt products, allowing them to quickly secure funding while staying in control of their business. Remagine will rollout business accounts in the coming months from its base in Germany, and plans to expand across Europe.While the fashion in fintech for a while now has been ‘Neo’ or ‘challenger’ banks, there is a new breed arriving: financing platforms. These offer banking services but also offer extra features aimed at new businesses. Another example is Rho in New York, which recently raised $15m.The ‘twist’ is that Remagine is going to aim at business with a ‘sustainable and impactful’ bent to their business model which might have a ‘positive social and environmental impact’. Remagine itself says it is also committing to impact-driven initiatives and will contribute 10% of its profits to impact causes.\nFounded by Julia M. Profeta Johansson and Sebastian Dienst, co-CEO Dienst said in a statement: “We believe capital and technology can be forces for good. When used together, they can be powerful tools that help shape the future. The challenge now is to shape it in a way that aligns people and planet with profit,” said\xa0“We believe that every business – big and small – can be more sustainable and impactful. Remagine has been created to help them achieve this.”\nJohansson added: “Having already provided financing to numerous companies, the funds raised will allow us to support many more startups towards more impact. With the upcoming launch of our accounts and cards, we’re excited to continue to grow the team, invest further in our products, and help create a world where money and business are forces for good.”\nWeiner said: “Sustainability and impact have become increasingly relevant for businesses over the past decade and today, research shows that nearly four-fifths of CEOs are planning to align their business strategy with social and environmental goals.. Remagine’s mission and business model enables founders to consider both their bottom line and their impact.

https://t.co/qA3Q46hqDx,2021-01-26T05:44:07,A look at the soaring valuations of Rivian and Cruise with transportation VC Reilly Brennan,"['Perhaps more than most, Reilly Brennan loves cars and trucks. The native Michigander happily did grunt work for an automotive magazine as an undergrad at the University of Michigan before landing a gig as a trackside communications manager at General Motors, spending a few years as an editor and a general manager with an automotive publisher called NextScreen, then becoming a programming director for AOL’s automotive properties.His next role would be on the West Coast, as executive director of an automotive research program at Stanford, where Brennan continues to be a lecturer. Little surprise that soon after, a seed-stage fund began to make sense, too, and thus was born Trucks Venture Capital, which has since made dozens of bets out of a $20 million debut effort and is wrapping up a larger fund soon.Late last week, we talked with Brennan about two of the fastest-soaring valuations we’ve seen recently in the automotive sector: that of the electric vehicle company Rivian, which raised a giant new round last week at a nearly $30 billion post-money valuation, and Cruise, which also raised a giant new round last week, and also at $30 billion valuation. (Along with some other interesting bets, Trucks managed to write an early check for Cruise before it was acquired in 2016 by GM, which maintains majority ownership of the company.)We wondered if even an auto aficionado might deem things a little bubbly. You can listen to that full conversation here. In the meantime, the excerpts below have been lightly edited for length and clarity.TC: Who are your investors in Trucks VC? Are they individuals? Are any auto manufacturers that are trying to get a look at nascent technologies?RB: We have some former execs from the car industry in the tech world, and a handful of family offices and definitely some large strategic companies. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you their names because I’ve signed documents that prevent me from doing that. But one of the cool things about our little Rolodex of [limited partners] is that our founders — when they want to come in and do something in transportation — it’s an easy doggie door into a lot of those entities, whether they’re people or businesses. One of the things I love about [the mix is] there’s probably no part of a vehicle, whether you’re talking about a car, truck, a bike, or a plane, that one of our investors couldn’t help out with.TC: Do you look to be the first money into your deals?RB: One of the interesting learnings I had in the first fund was, we were just trying to participate; we were just happy to be at the party. So we were participating in rounds that other people were leading, and our checks [from Fund I] were anywhere from $100,000 to a few thousand dollars.The new fund is designed to take advantage of leading rounds [because] halfway through our first fund, founders would ask us to lead rounds, and frankly, the fund wasn’t big enough to do that. Our new fund is really designed so we can lead seed rounds, and that’s what we do. We’ll lead or co-lead and sit on the board. Usually, we’re\xa0 owning about 10% to 12% of a company at seed.TC: One of Truck’s early checks went to Cruise, the self-driving car company that GM acquired for an amount that has variously been reported as more than $1 billion, as well as for closer to $500 million . . .RB: The Cruise investment, my [fellow general partners] Jeff and Kate made. I can’t tell you specifically what the acquisition price was, but it was pretty good. That being said, if you read about the valuation of Cruise now within General Motors, or that of another [self-driving] company we invested in, Nutonomy, which was acquired by [automotive supplier] Delphi [for $450 million in 2017] and is now essentially a company called Motional, they’re pretty high.I think a lot about those early exits because they validated the space, but I also think a lot of the early investors probably wish they had more ownership. I’m not saying they shouldn’t have sold. But you look at the valuation of Cruise and Motional today — if you put those two entities together — it’s more than the valuation of General Motors, or maybe Ford Motor Company.TC: But is Cruise’s valuation perhaps too high right now? They still have a very long lead time to making money.RB: I would agree with you that in the public market, it feels a little bubbly when it comes to electric vehicles and some of these ideas related to technology and auto. But I do think a lot of these companies look at the opportunity to automate things greater than just robo-taxis. Last year in particular provided good insight into how the logistics and delivery part of automation is probably on the nearer term horizon than robo-taxis and therefore more valuable.TC: How much have valuations been driven up by Tesla, whose market cap now dwarfs all the major car manufacturers?RB: One of the things the market appears to want is the simple story, and belief in Tesla is now highly aligned to [thinking that] this is just the way that transportation is going to be organized. It’s going to be a zero-emission vehicle that is highly connected and maybe attached to a consumer in a new way.You’re seeing the same with a lot of these pure-play EV companies, whether it’s [carmaker] Fisker doing a SPAC or the way that [carmaker] Neo is received in China. There’s this purity of their message.You can argue, successfully, that a lot of other companies have more engineering or a greater dealer network or more IP around a particular idea, but when it comes to the public market stuff, it really is about painting the picture in this one specific way that’s aligned with the future. And right now, the public markets really don’t like that composite, liberal arts approach to vehicle manufacturing; they really just want one thing that aligns very well with the future, which they believe is better electric vehicles.TC: This seemingly applies to the carmaker Rivian. What do you think of this company that’s valued at nearly $30 billion yet hasn’t yet sold a truck or SUV? You aren’t one of its investors. Does its valuation make sense to you?RB: From an engineering perspective, Rivian is probably one of the companies I respect most out of this new breed of manufacturers.Tens years ago, when they started, there were a lot of new supercar entrepreneurs who were trying to start something new, but they were always small batch ideas. Like, maybe you could get 100 people to buy one. But they weren’t really well-aligned with what consumers were buying, which is increasingly utilities and trucks. So Rivian’s approach, with the segment it’s going after, is really smart, and it has fantastic engineering. So I’m actually quite bullish on Rivian.In a year’s time, there will probably be two big events for Rivian. One, they will deliver the first batch of [electric delivery vans being built for] Amazon, along with [other orders] to some of the early customers. It also wouldn’t surprise me if they’re public at some point in the next year.\nThey haven’t told me that; just my own personal speculation here.TC: When you say it will go public, do you mean through a traditional IPO or maybe through a giant SPAC? Would what you guess?I bet that Rivian will probably do a traditional IPO, that’s my guess. But they could also do a SPAC at some point. [Either way] I think the public markets are going to be really interested in Rivian. I just think there’s really good stuff there.TC: Have you been able to test-drive its cars? Have you seen its tech up close? What makes you so confident that what Rivian is building is superior?RB: I think the point of view they have about the segments is really interesting In the U.S., they are going after two great-growing segments in the business, which is utilities and trucks where, by the way, there’s a lot of margin, and there’s nobody specifically going after those segments.The Rivian engineering that I speak about is really about the hires they’ve made and a lot of things they’ve done for years in advance of getting these vehicles ready. They’ve got a lot of amazing talent from big manufacturers. They made an unusual but really smart investment in a vehicle assembly facility that they purchased for relatively cheap years ago that was owned by Mitsubishi. And they put together all these components well in advance of anybody really even knowing about them, which is really smart.Obviously, there’s still a huge amount of risk. What I’m saying is not investment advice. I just think there’s a lot of interesting stuff there that’s head and shoulders above many of the other EV companies, where there’s not a lot of substance, to be candid.TC: My colleague Kirsten reported in December that Rivian is developing a network of charging stations along interstate highways and also at spots like hiking trails to accommodate who it imagines will be its customers. Does that make sense to you? Relatedly, how many different types of charging stations are we going to have in the world?[Regarding the location of its stations], it’s definitely a nice ingredient in the story they’re trying to tell, though I don’t think you’ll see a Rivian charger at the entry point of every national park. They’ll probably have access to other charging networks. One of the things we’re seeing in the U.S. is you have some of these dedicated networks like Tesla has, and then you have a lot of agnostic [stations], where you can plug in and charge in a lot of other places, and Rivian will likely take advantage of that. An open question would be whether Rivian builds its own [larger] dedicated network that has a lot of coverage, and I don’t know about that yet.The other component about Rivian that’s really fascinating is what they do for service and maintenance. I saw an open job that Rivian had a few months ago around remote diagnostics, and one of the bullet points of the job posting was that this job was really designed so that people didn’t have to go back to the dealership. [It begs the question of]: could you design experiences digitally,\xa0 as with [on-demand remote doctor visits], where you could potentially talk to somebody live, you could [have Rivian] assess the vehicle, or maybe walk you through a situation where you can fix something that would prevent a lot of the trips to dealer?If you consider the traditional dealer and OEM relationship, a lot of the ways that cars are designed is that they’re constantly having to go back to the dealer. Rivian’s point of view on that is really different, and that’s one of the other reasons it’s one to watch.']",in an interview last July,"['Cruise', 'VC Reilly Brennan', 'NavigationClose', 'Cruise', 'VC Reilly', 'BrennanConnie Loizos@cookie', 'Reilly Brennan', 'Michigander', 'the University of Michigan', 'General Motors', 'NextScreen', 'AOL', 'Stanford', 'Brennan', 'Trucks Venture Capital', 'Brennan', 'Cruise', 'Trucks', 'Cruise', 'GM', 'Trucks VC', 'GM', 'Jeff', 'Kate', 'Cruise', 'General Motors', 'Motional', 'General Motors', 'Ford Motor Company', 'Cruise', 'Tesla', 'EV', 'Fisker', 'SPAC', 'IP', 'Amazon', 'Mitsubishi', 'EV', 'Kirsten', 'Tesla', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Venture', 'Cruise', 'VC Reilly', 'BrennanConnie', 'Reilly Brennan', 'Michigander', 'the University of Michigan', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/ikxB044ZMD,2021-01-26T05:00:44,Berlin’s Remagine secures $24M to finance high-growth and impact-led startups,"['Remagine, a financing platform offering banking services to high-growth companies with an ‘impact’ twist, has raised €20 million ($24M) in a Seed funding round. The Berlin-based startup has been operating in stealth mode, but already has 20 clients under its former brand name ‘Get Conscious Growth’. Its backers include former Global Head of Google Payment Jonathan Weiner and former COO of Venmo Michael Vaughn. Remagine’s lead investor is unmade but Techcrunch understands it comprises largely of debt financing.The fintech will specialize in offering revenue-based financing for high-growth and impact-led businesses, which tends to be more founder-friendly than equity or debt products, allowing them to quickly secure funding while staying in control of their business. Remagine will rollout business accounts in the coming months from its base in Germany, and plans to expand across Europe.While the fashion in fintech for a while now has been ‘Neo’ or ‘challenger’ banks, there is a new breed arriving: financing platforms. These offer banking services but also offer extra features aimed at new businesses. Another example is Rho in New York, which recently raised $15m.The ‘twist’ is that Remagine is going to aim at business with a ‘sustainable and impactful’ bent to their business model which might have a ‘positive social and environmental impact’. Remagine itself says it is also committing to impact-driven initiatives and will contribute 10% of its profits to impact causes.\nFounded by Julia M. Profeta Johansson and Sebastian Dienst, co-CEO Dienst said in a statement: “We believe capital and technology can be forces for good. When used together, they can be powerful tools that help shape the future. The challenge now is to shape it in a way that aligns people and planet with profit,” said\xa0“We believe that every business – big and small – can be more sustainable and impactful. Remagine has been created to help them achieve this.”\nJohansson added: “Having already provided financing to numerous companies, the funds raised will allow us to support many more startups towards more impact. With the upcoming launch of our accounts and cards, we’re excited to continue to grow the team, invest further in our products, and help create a world where money and business are forces for good.”\nWeiner said: “Sustainability and impact have become increasingly relevant for businesses over the past decade and today, research shows that nearly four-fifths of CEOs are planning to align their business strategy with social and environmental goals.. Remagine’s mission and business model enables founders to consider both their bottom line and their impact. This is the future of financing and we’re delighted to be a part of it.”\nRemagine’s products will include Team cards (unlimited separate cards for team members to improve expense management); Multi-IBANs; analytics; zero negative interest; and free accounts.

https://t.co/UBkPIJcxUR,2021-01-26T04:18:13,SoftBank-backed travel platform Klook raises $200M amid COVID-19,"['Klook, the Hong Kong-based travel activities platform backed by SoftBank Vision Fund, announced the closure of $200 million in funding for its Series E round, lifting the startup’s total capital raised to date to $720 million.Aspex Management, an investment fund focused on Asia Pacific led the round, alongside existing backers Sequoia Capital China, Softbank Vision Fund 1, Matrix Partners China, Boyu Capital, as well as a handful of new investors.Securing sizable funding at a time the COVID-19 pandemic sacks the global economy is congratulatory, not to mention Klook is in an industry severely hit by the virus. The startup, which enables its mostly Asia-based users to book activities in overseas destinations, lost millions of orders over the first few months of travel restrictions. The company quickly regrouped for a pivot to staycation and software-as-a-service for local activity merchants, including ticketing, distribution, inventory management and marketing. Bookings subsequently rebounded.“There are things to do at home, as well as local things to do when people could travel,” co-founder and chief operating officer Eric Gnock Fah told TechCrunch in an interview last July. “Now [the pandemic] is giving us an opportunity to add a new aspect to it.”The arrival of the new funding appears timely. Klook reached profitability in a number of markets by last July but overall was still in an aggressive expansion mode, it told TechCrunch at the time. Founded in 2014, Klook exceeded $1 billion in valuation in 2018 but declined to reveal its latest post-money valuation, which almost certainly has increased since it reached the unicorn status. The company currently has no plans to go public, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.COVID-19 pivot: Travel unicorn Klook sees jump in staycationsIn Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan where COVID-19 restrictions have gradually eased, Klook said it saw increased spending on local activities, with bookings reaching near pre-COVID levels. At the height of the pandemic, Klook onboarded 150% more activities compared to the same period in 2019.Today, Klook’s SaaS software powers millions of bookings for more than 2,500 merchants worldwide. With proceeds from the new investment, it will continue working on the development and roll-out of its merchant SaaS solutions.“This new capital further strengthens our leading position to take us from defense to offense, as domestic tourism becomes ubiquitous and international travel gradually returns,” said Ethan Lin, co-founder and chief executive at Klook.']",“an Android for smart driving.,"['SoftBank', 'NavigationClose', 'Eric Gnock Fah', 'Ethan Lin', 'Bernie XiongKlook', 'SoftBank Vision Fund', 'Aspex Management', 'Sequoia Capital China', 'Softbank Vision Fund 1', 'Boyu Capital', 'Eric Gnock Fah', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'Klook', 'Ethan Lin', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'COVID-19Rita Liao5:18 AM GMT+1•January', 'SoftBank Vision Fund', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/VQzf51hAtI,2021-01-26T04:10:04,"Forget winning, can Amazon survive in India?","['During a visit to India in 2014, Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos made a splashy announcement: His firm was investing $2 billion in the South Asian nation, just a year after beginning operations in the country.Amazon’s announcement underscored how far India had come to open up to foreign firms. The nation, which had largely kept doors shut to international giants between its independence in 1947 to liberalization in 1991, has slowly transformed itself into the world’s largest open market.In a televised interview in 2014, Bezos said that there was a perception about India not being an easy place to do business. But Amazon’s growth in the country, he said, was proof that this belief is not accurate.“Are there obstacles? There are always obstacles. Anywhere you go, every country has its own regulations and rules,” he said.Six years, and more than $4.5 billion of additional investments later, Amazon today appears to be facing more obstacles than ever in India, the second-largest internet market with more than 600 million users.Long-standing laws in India have constrained Amazon, which has yet to turn a profit in the country, and other e-commerce firms to not hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.India got around to fixing this loophole in late 2018 in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to delist hundreds of thousands of items from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.Now the nation is set to further toughen this approach. Reuters reported last week that New Delhi is considering making adjustments to some provisions that would prevent affiliated firms to hold even an indirect stake in a seller through their parent.The Confederation of All India Traders, an Indian trade body that claims to represent over 80 million businesses, told the publication that Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has assured the organization that it is working to shortly address concerns about alleged violations of current rules.The forthcoming policy change is only one of the many headaches for the world’s largest e-commerce firm in India.Offline retailers in India have long expressed concerns about what they allege to be unfair practices employed by Amazon in India. Last year, during Bezos’ visit to the country, they held several protests. (Photo by SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP via Getty Images)Amazon is aggressively fighting a battle to block a deal between its estranged partner Future Group and Reliance Retail, the two largest retail chains in India.Last year, Future Group announced that it would sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses to Reliance Retail for $3.4 billion. Amazon, which in 2019 bought stakes in one of Future Group’s unlisted firms, says that the Indian firm has breached its contract (which would have given Amazon the right to first refusal) and engaged in insider trading.Despite technology giants and investors ploughing more than $20 billion to create an e-commerce market in India in the past decade, online retail still accounts for only a single-digit pie of all retail in the country.In recent years, Amazon, Walmart and scores of other startups have embraced this realization and sought to work with neighborhood stores that dot tens of thousands of cities, towns and villages in India.From India’s richest man to Amazon and 100s of startups: The great rush to win neighborhood storesWith Reliance Retail and telecom giant Jio Platforms, two subsidiaries of one of India’s largest corporates (Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries) entering the e-commerce market, and receiving the backing of global giants including Facebook and Google last year, cornering a big stake in Future Group is one of the few ways Amazon can accelerate its growth in India.The American e-commerce firm has had little luck so far in overturning the deal between the Indian firms. Last year, Amazon reached out to Indian antitrust body Competition Commission of India, and market regulator SEBI to block this transaction. Both the bodies have ruled in favor of Future Group and Reliance Retail.Amazon must have foreseen this outcome because it initiated the legal proceedings at an arbitration court in Singapore. It’s no surprise that the firm chose to also pursue its legal argument outside of India.Most cases that reach the Singapore International Arbitration Court have come from India in recent years. Vodafone, which has invested more than $20 billion in India, and has been dealt with billions of dollars in unpaid taxes by the country, is another high-profile name to have knocked on the door in Singapore. After losing in India, it emerged victorious in the Singapore arbitration court last year.Amazon on Monday filed a new petition in Delhi High Court in which it is seeking to enforce SIAC’s ruling (which ordered last year that the deal should be temporarily halted) and prevent the Indian firm from going ahead with the deal based on CCI and SEBI’s judgements.The company alleges that Future Group “deliberately and maliciously” disobeyed the international arbitration ruling from SIAC. In its petition, Amazon is also seeking detention of Kishore Biyani, the founder and chairman of Future Group.“Vocal for Local”As India grappled with containing the spread of the coronavirus last year, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the 1.3 billion citizens to make the country “self-reliant” and “be vocal for local.”The move to turn inwards contrasts with his major promise in the first few years of assuming power in 2014 when he pledged to make India more welcoming to foreign firms than before. In recent years, India has proposed or enforced several regulations that hurt American firms, though none appear to suffer as much as Amazon.Last year,\xa0New Delhi started to enforce a 2% tax on all foreign billings for digital services provided in the country. The U.S. Trade Representative said earlier this month that India was taxing numerous categories of digital services that are “not leviable under other digital services taxes adopted around the world.”The aggregate tax bill for U.S. companies could exceed $30 million per year in India, USTR’s investigation found. In conclusion, it found India’s digital tax move to be inconsistent with international tax principles, unreasonable and burdening or restricting U.S. commerce.Modi’s new way of life for India will be music to the ears of Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, an ally of the prime minister and India’s richest man.Before selling stakes worth over $20 billion in Jio Platforms and more than $6 billion in Reliance Retail to marquee foreign investors, Ambani famously made a speech in 2019 in which he urged the need to protect Indians’ data in patriotic terms.“We have to collectively launch a new movement against data colonization. For India to succeed in this data-driven revolution, we will have to migrate the control and ownership of Indian data back to India — in other words, Indian wealth back to every Indian,” he said.Why so many international firms have invested in one of Reliance’s properties remains a big question. A senior executive at an American firm told TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity (out of fear of retribution) that the investments in Jio Platforms, which is India’s largest telecom network with nearly 410 million subscribers, and Reliance Retail is a déjà vu moment for the nation, where a few decades ago one of the only ways to do business in the nation was to partner with a local firm with massive political clout.In a series of tweets, Raman Chima, a former policy executive at Google and who now works at nonprofit digital advocacy group Access Now, alleged that the Android-maker had weighed in 2011-12 partnering and investing in a firm like Reliance to “turn-the-page on Indian political risks.”The idea prompted concerns about Google’s values, he claimed. “More than one executive involved in those discussions flagged concerns around Reliance’s reputation, particularly around problematic approaches towards gaining influence with policymaking civil servants and politicians, money, ethics in govt-business relationships.”Amazon itself was rumored to be interested in getting a multi-billion-dollar stake in Reliance Retail last year, but it appears the two firms have stopped engaging on any matter.BJP MLA Ram Kadam and his party workers protest against the Amazon Prime web series Tandav outside Bandra-Kurla Police station, on January 18, 2021 in Mumbai, India. (Photo by Pratik Chorge/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)While Amazon sorts out these issues, last week delivered another blow to the firm. A senior executive with the firm as well as Indian makers of a mini-series for Amazon Prime Video are under threat of criminal prosecution in the country after Modi’s ruling party deemed the show offensive to the country’s Hindu majority.A Hindu nationalist group, politicians with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and a BJP group representing members of India’s lower castes, were among those who had filed police reports against the nine-part mini-series “Tandav” and Amazon. The company bowed to the pressure and edited out some scenes.“The true reason for the complaints against ‘Tandav’ may be that the show holds up a mirror uncomfortably close to Indian society and some of the problems blamed on Mr. Modi’s administration. In the opening episode, the show features protesting students and disgruntled farmers, echoing events that have taken place in recent months,” The New York Times wrote.“Mirzapur,” another show of Amazon, also attracted a criminal complaint in India last week for hurting religious and regional sentiments and defaming the Indian town.

https://t.co/HeqYIltIYy,2021-01-26T03:02:58,"BlackBerry and Baidu deepen autonomous, connected car partnership","['BlackBerry and Chinese search engine giant Baidu have agreed to expand a partnership that aims to give automakers the tools they need to launch next-generation connected and autonomous vehicles in China.Under the deal, Baidu’s high-definition maps will be integrated into BlackBerry’s QNX Neutrino Real-Time Operating System. The embedded system will be mass produced in the upcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the electric vehicle arm of GAC Group, one of the country’s top three automakers that produces more 2 million vehicles a year.The aim of this new, expanded partnership is to “provide car manufacturers with a clear and fast path to the production of autonomous vehicles, with safety and security as the top priority,” according to a statement from Wang Yunpeng, senior director of the technology department of Baidu’s Intelligent Driving Group.The partnership between Baidu and BlackBerry is notable because it inserts a foreign operating system into Chinese-made vehicles even as the government there has called for native tech.BlackBerry’s QNX software handles the functional safety, network security and reliability pieces, while Baidu has invested in the development of artificial intelligence and deep learning.“Together, we can help car manufacturers quickly produce safe autonomous vehicles and promote the development collaboratively of the intelligent networked automobile industry,” Yunpeng said.BlackBerry, once the dominate force in the smart phone industry, has found success getting its QNX technology into vehicles. Today, the software is used in the advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters and infotainment systems of more than 175 million vehicles.The agreement builds on the two companies January 2018 agreement to make BlackBerry QNX’s operating system the foundation for Baidu’s ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.The deal with Baidu also helps BlackBerry continue to carve out market share in China, where it’s a more recent entrant. Last year, Blackberry announced QNX would be integrated into Tesla rival Xpeng’s electric vehicles in China.“With BlackBerry QNX’s embedded software as its foundation, Baidu has made significant progress as part of its Apollo platform in establishing a commercial ecosystem for innovative technologies that OEMs can leverage for their next generation vehicles,” Dhiraj Handa, vice president of channel, partners and APAC, BlackBerry Technology Solutions, said in a statement.Baidu’s autonomous driving program, known as Apollo, has been described as the “an Android for smart driving.” The Apollo program has landed more than hundred manufacturing and supplier partners. Baidu has also been busy testing autonomous driving and launch a robotaxi fleet in September.The deal also comes on the heels of Baidu’s push beyond automotive software and into the production of vehicles. Baidu announced earlier this month that it plans to set up a new company to produce electric vehicles with the help of Chinese automaker Geely. Baidu will provide so-called smart driving technologies while Geely handles will the design, engineering and manufacturing of the vehicles.']",prepares to sharpen its focus,"['Baidu', 'NavigationClose', 'Baidu', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'Baidu', 'Baidu', 'Baidu’s', 'BlackBerry', 'QNX Neutrino Real-Time Operating System', 'GAC New Energy Aion', 'GAC Group', 'Wang Yunpeng', 'Baidu’s Intelligent Driving Group', 'Baidu', 'BlackBerry', 'BlackBerry’s', 'QNX', 'Baidu', 'Yunpeng', 'QNX', 'BlackBerry QNX’s', 'Baidu’s', 'Baidu', 'BlackBerry', 'Blackberry', 'QNX', 'Tesla', 'BlackBerry QNX’s', 'Baidu', 'Apollo', 'Dhiraj Handa', 'APAC', 'BlackBerry Technology Solutions', 'Baidu', 'Apollo', 'Android', 'Apollo', 'Baidu', 'Baidu’s', 'Baidu', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Baidu', 'Korosec4:02 AM', 'Baidu', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/dvim2hsVrJ,2021-01-26T00:30:33,President Joe Biden commits to replacing entire federal fleet with electric vehicles,"['President Joe Biden said Monday the U.S. government would replace the entire federal fleet of cars, trucks and SUVs with electric vehicles manufactured in the United States, a commitment tied to a broader campaign promise to create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry and supply chains.The commitment, if it bears out, could give a boost to U.S. automakers, particularly those that have diverse portfolios that include passenger cars, commercial vans and light trucks.Biden made the comments prior to signing the Made in America executive order, which places stricter rules on the federal government’s procurement practices. The government has existing “buy American” rules, which states that a certain amount of a product must be made in the U.S. for a purchase to qualify for a federal contract.Biden said this order closes loopholes and aims to increase purchases of products made in the United States. The executive order increases that product threshold and the price preference for domestic goods — meaning the difference in price from which the government can buy a product for a non-U.S. supplier. It also updates the process for how the government decides if a product was sufficiently made in America.In the midst of his speech, Biden said the buy American directive would extend to the federal government’s massive fleet of vehicles.“The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we’re going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America, by American workers, creating millions of jobs — a million auto worker jobs.”GM targets delivery companies with new EV business unit BrightDropThe opportunity is a large one. The U.S. government had more than 645,000 vehicles in its fleet in 2019, the most recent data available from the General Services Agency. Of those, about 224,000 are passenger vehicles and more than 412,000 are trucks.“GSA is committed to exploring opportunities to leverage the purchasing and leasing power of the federal government to address the climate crisis, including greening the federal fleet,” a GSA spokesperson told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “GSA currently manages over 224,000 passenger vehicles in its fleet to support the Federal Government’s mission. By leveraging clean energy vehicle technologies, GSA will support the President’s climate goals, while working with the American automotive manufacturing industry to ensure that these next generation vehicles are built in America by American workers.”The directive won’t be easy to fulfill. Many of these federal vehicles are leased, which could slow the transition depending on the contract lengths. There are other obstacles, including charging infrastructure and supply. And while it doesn’t appear to be a requirement, Biden has publicly stated numerous times — including Monday — that he supports union automotive jobs.Tesla is considered the dominant U.S. manufacturer of electric vehicles. However, the company’s lack of union workers and the higher cost of its vehicles — even the less expensive Model 3 — could be a barrier.Ford and GM might not have a vast supply of electric vehicles at the moment, but they do have union shops and both automakers are investing heavily to expand their EV offerings.GM launched a new business unit earlier this month to offer commercial customers an ecosystem of electric and connected products as part of the company’s $27 billion bid to become a leading electric automaker. The new business, called BrightDrop, will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1.GM has said it plans to bring 30 new electric vehicles to a global market through 2025. More than two-thirds of those launches will be available in North America and every one of GM’s brands, including Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet and Buick, will be represented, according to the automaker.Meanwhile, Ford revealed in November a configurable all-electric cargo van called the E-Transit as part of its $11.5 billion investment in electrification. Ford has largely focused its electrification efforts on the consumer market, notably the Mustang Mach-E. The E-Transit, which will be built at its Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, Missouri, is aimed at the commercial sector.Ford unveils the 2022 E-Transit, its $45,000 electric workhorseThere are a growing number of newer EV entrants as well, including Rivian, Lordstown Motors and Fisker. Rivian is expected to begin producing and delivering its electric pickup truck in July, followed by its all-electric SUV. Rivian is also developing and assembling electric vans for Amazon.Biden’s call to transform the fleet supports statements he made throughout his campaign. Biden pledged to “use all the levers of the federal government,” including purchasing power, R&D, tax, trade, and investment policies to position the U.S. to be the global leader in the manufacture of electric vehicles and their input materials and parts.']",MIT’s contribution,"['Joe Biden', 'NavigationClose', 'Joe Biden', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'Joe Biden', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'EV', 'BrightDropThe', 'the General Services Agency', 'GSA', 'GSA', 'the Federal Government’s', 'GSA', 'Biden', 'Tesla', 'Ford', 'GM', 'EV', 'GM', 'BrightDrop', 'GM', 'Cadillac', 'GMC', 'Chevrolet', 'Buick', 'Ford', 'the E-Transit', 'Ford', 'Kansas City Assembly Plant', 'Ford', 'EV', 'Lordstown Motors', 'Fisker', 'Amazon', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Joe Biden', 'Korosec1:30 AM', 'Joe Biden', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/HQeRoyCK1q,2021-01-26T00:04:02,"Facebook News launches in the UK, the first international market for its curated news portal","['As the United Kingdom prepares to sharpen its focus on how it regulates big tech companies, Facebook is taking a big step up in the role it plays in presenting media to the U.K. public, and into how it works with the country’s media industry.Today it is launching Facebook News in the U.K., Facebook’s first market outside of the U.S. for its dedicated, curated news portal — accessed, like the U.S. version, through a tab in the Android or iOS app menu.The portal will launch with content from hundreds of local and national media organizations including Channel 4 News, Daily Mail Group, DC Thomson, Financial Times, Sky\xa0News and Telegraph Media Group. The Economist, The Guardian, The Independent, STV and hundreds of local news\xa0sites from Archant, Iliffe, JPI Media, Midlands\xa0News Association, and Reach, as well as “lifestyle” titles GQ, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Vogue and others were\xa0announced in an earlier list of partners last year.Again, as with the U.S. version, users will be provided a list of curated top stories of the day; a list of personalized stories based on news sources you might already follow or interests you have (these might be from publications you don’t already follow); and dedicated news sections for sports, entertainment, health and science and technology. Users can indicate when they like stories, or when they want to hide them to train the algorithms better.Facebook has confirmed to us that it will be working with a service called Upday to curate\xa0the stories that appear\xa0on News. “The product is a mix of curated, top stories and personalized links chosen by algorithm,” a spokesperson said. Upday appears to be a joint collaboration between German publisher Axel Springer and Samsung, which also runs a news service on its phones powered by it.It is not clear what the financial terms of the deal is between Facebook and Upday, but reportedly, the licensing deals Facebook is cutting with publishers to place their content in News collectively run into the tens of millions of pounds, with the biggest publishers making millions a year from the the agreements. While those figures might pale to what Facebook makes in ad revenues globally — that reaches into the tens of billions of dollars quarterly — they represent significant sums for the beleaguered U.K. media industry.People have long used newsfeeds on Facebook and other social sites to catch up with news while also browsing posts from friends, Groups and Pages that they follow. Facebook News aims to take that a step further, as a curated page for links and headlines from hundreds of publications in the country to provide users of its mobile apps a one-stop place to read the stories of the moment.Social media continues to be a major source of news for consumers, but as we’ve seen, a very skewed and flawed source at that.Within that context, Facebook says that its intention with Facebook News is to provide a more balanced and dedicated mix of news to people beyond what they might encounter in their newsfeeds, while also tailoring it to users’ interests.It also helps that Facebook News provides yet another way for Facebook — which has made efforts in video, entertainment content, mentoring and job-hunting, Nextdoor-style community listings, peer-to-peer selling, and more — to continue diversifying away from the Newsfeed for those who have grown bored with that: now, people can come to the Facebook app to browse news, too.Still, this international expansion has been a long time coming: Facebook News first launched as a test in the US more than a year ago, in October 2019, before rolling out to all users last June.No word from Facebook on how many users or engagement the U.S. version of Facebook News has picked up, except that “it has grown steadily,” according to a spokesperson.It’s not clear why there’s been such a long gap between its first efforts in the U.S. and the U.K. launch today, but Facebook has had more going on in addition to securing those licensing deals to roll out in this market.Launching a new news portal, with the message that it’s designed to “help” publishers, takes on a new dimension when you consider that Facebook has also been in the crosshairs of regulators in Europe, who have been on a long-term mission to scrutinize the reach of big tech companies. In the UK, that is soon taking the form of a new “pro-competition” Digital Market Unit that will re-examine the role companies like Facebook and Google play in advertising, media and more.\xa0Whether those regulatory moves will impact how a service like Facebook News works, or what revenue cuts and usage data are shared with news partners, remains to be seen. In the meantime, it’s full speed ahead for more scaling: Facebook confirmed plans last year that its long-term aim is for a bigger international expansion for Facebook News, with the longer list of countries including Brazil, France, Germany, and India. In a blog post today, Facebook’s director of news partnerships in Europe, Jesper Doub, confirmed France and Germany were next in line for Facebook News, although no launch dates were specified.']",Twitter launched a new product,"['NavigationClose ScreenFacebook News', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Facebook’s', 'Android', 'Channel 4 News', 'Daily Mail Group', 'DC Thomson, Financial Times', 'Sky\xa0News', 'Telegraph Media Group', 'Guardian', 'STV', 'Archant', 'JPI Media', 'Reach', 'GQ', 'Axel Springer', 'Samsung', 'Groups', 'Facebook', 'Facebook News', 'Facebook News', 'Facebook News', 'Digital Market Unit', 'Facebook News', 'Facebook News', 'Facebook’s', 'Jesper Doub', 'Facebook News', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Lunden1:04 AM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/OSyyytm4ct,2021-01-25T23:53:08,"Debunk, don’t ‘prebunk,’ and other psychology lessons for social media moderation","['If social networks and other platforms are to get a handle on disinformation, it’s not enough to know what it is — you have to know how people react to it. Researchers at MIT and Cornell have some surprising but subtle findings that may affect how Twitter and Facebook should go about treating this problematic content.MIT’s contribution is a counterintuitive one. When someone encounters a misleading headline in their timeline, the logical thing to do would be to put a warning before it so that the reader knows it’s disputed from the start. Turns out that’s not quite the case.The study of nearly 3,000 people had them evaluating the accuracy of headlines after receiving different (or no) warnings about them.“Going into the project, I had anticipated it would work best to give the correction beforehand, so that people already knew to disbelieve the false claim when they came into contact with it. To my surprise, we actually found the opposite,” said study co-author David Rand in an MIT news article. “Debunking the claim after they were exposed to it was the most effective.”Why the world must pay attention to the fight against disinformation and fake news in TaiwanWhen a person was warned beforehand that the headline was misleading, they improved in their classification accuracy by 5.7%. When the warning came simultaneously with the headline, that improvement grew to 8.6%. But if shown the warning afterwards, they were 25% better. In other words, debunking beat “prebunking” by a fair margin.The team speculated as to the cause of this, suggesting that it fits with other indications that people are more likely to incorporate feedback into a preexisting judgment rather than alter that judgment as it’s being formed. They warned that the problem is far deeper than a tweak like this can fix.“There is no single magic bullet that can cure the problem of misinformation,” said co-author Adam Berinsky. “Studying basic questions in a systematic way is a critical step toward a portfolio of effective solutions.”The study from Cornell is equal parts reassuring and frustrating. People viewing potentially misleading information were reliably influenced by the opinions of large groups — whether or not those groups were politically aligned with the reader.It’s reassuring because it suggests that people are willing to trust that if 80 out of 100 people thought a story was a little fishy, even if 70 of those 80 were from the other party, there might just be something to it. It’s frustrating because of how seemingly easy it is to sway an opinion simply by saying that a large group thinks it’s one way or the other.Ringing alarm bells, Biden campaign calls Facebook ‘foremost propagator’ of voting disinformation“In a practical way, we’re showing that people’s minds can be changed through social influence independent of politics,” said graduate student Maurice Jakesch, lead author of the paper. “This opens doors to use social influence in a way that may de-polarize online spaces and bring people together.”Partisanship still played a role, it must be said — people were about 21% less likely to have their view swayed if the group opinion was led by people belonging to the other party. But even so, people were very likely to be affected by the group’s judgment.Part of why misinformation is so prevalent is because we don’t really understand why it’s so appealing to people, and what measures reduce that appeal, among other simple questions. As long as social media is blundering around in darkness they’re unlikely to stumble upon a solution, but every study like this makes a little more light.Europe to put forward rules for political ads transparency and beef up its disinformation code next year\xa0\xa0']",Latch,"['Bryce Durbin', 'MIT', 'Cornell', 'MIT’s', 'David Rand', 'MIT', 'Adam Berinsky', 'Cornell', 'Biden', 'disinformation“In', 'Maurice Jakesch', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Institute of Technologymoderationsocial', 'MIT', 'Cornell', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/oI4x3XtNWi,2021-01-25T22:59:25,Smart lock maker Latch teams with real estate firm to go public via SPAC,"['This week, Latch becomes the latest company to join the SPAC parade. Founded in 2014, the New York-based company came out of stealth two years later, launching a smart lock system. Though, like many companies primarily known for hardware solutions, Latch says it’s more, offering a connected security software platform for owners of apartment buildings.The company is set to go public courtesy of a merger with blank check company TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp. As far as partners go, Tishman Speyer Properties makes strategic sense here. The New York-based commercial real estate firm is a logical partner for a company whose technology is currently deployed exclusively in residential apartment buildings.“With a standard IPO, you have all of the banks take you out to all of the big investors,” Latch founder and CEO Luke Schoenfelder tells TechCrunch. “We felt like there was an opportunity here to have an extra level of strategic partnership and an extra level of product expansion that came as part of the process. Our ability to go into Europe and commercial offices is now accelerated meaningfully because of this partnership.The number of SPAC deals has increased substantially over the past several months, including recent examples like Taboola. According to Crunchbase, Latch has raised $152 million, to date. And the company has seen solid growth over the past year — not something every hardware or hardware adjacent company can say about the pandemic.As my colleague Alex noted on Extra Crunch today, “Doing some quick match, Latch grew booked revenues 50.5% from 2019 to 2020. Its booked software revenues grew 37.1%, while its booked hardware top line expanded over 70% during the same period.”“We’ve been a customer and investor in Latch for years,” Tishman Speyer President and CEO Rob Speyer tells TechCrunch. “Our customers — the people who live in our buildings — love the Latch product. So we’ve rolled it out across our residential portfolio […] I hope we can act as both a thought partner and product incubator for them.”While the company plans to expand to commercial offices, apartment buildings have been a nice vertical thus far — meaning the company doesn’t have to compete as directly in the crowded smart home lock category. Among other things, it’s probably a net positive if you’re going head to head against, say Amazon.

https://t.co/bBnKxxeDLs,2021-01-23T02:45:55,Could giant SPACs be next?,"['While many deemed 2020 the year of SPAC, short for special purpose acquisition company, 2021 may well make last year look quaint in comparison.It’s probably not premature to be asking: is there any company too big to be SPAC’d?Just today, we saw the trading debut of the most valuable company to date go public through a merger with one of these SPACs: 35-five-year-old, Pontiac, Michigan-based United Wholesale Mortgage, which is among the biggest mortgage companies in the U.S.Its shares slipped a bit by the end of trading, closing at $11.35 down from their starting price of $11.54, but it’s doubtful anyone involved is crying into their cocktails tonight. The outfit was valued at a whopping $16 billion when its merger with the blank-check outfit Gores Holdings IV was approved earlier this week.Why is this interesting? Well, first, despite UWM’s size, its path to going public took less than a year, beginning with Gores Holdings IV completing its IPO in late January 2020 and raising approximately $425 million in cash.Alec Gores, the billionaire founder of of the private equity firm Gores Group, led the deal. The tie-up was announced back in September and ultimately included an additional $500 million private placement. (It’s typical to tack-on these transactions once a target company has been identified and accepts the terms of the proposed merger. Most targets are many times larger than the blank check companies with which they are joining forces.)Also notable is that UWM is a mature company, one that says it generated $1.3 billion in revenue in the third quarter of last year alone and whose CEO, whose father started the company in 1986, said last fall that the company is “massively profitable.”It’s a story unlike that of most outfits to go public recently through the SPAC process. Consider Opendoor, Luminar Technologies, and Virgin Galactic. Each is still developing a business that needs capital to keep going and which might not have found much more funding from private market investors.SpaceX director Steve Jurvetson underscored the point pretty bluntly last week, saying, for example, that Virgin Galactic has seen “no positive business development” since being taken public. “They announced that they’re going to develop a hypersonic plane, but that has zero synergy with the current business they’re trying to launch, which is suborbital spaceflights, which have yet to happen for customers.”If more profitable, more mature, more businesses with a very clear path to future revenue — more companies like UMW — begin choosing SPACs over traditional IPOs, it could change widespread perceptions of SPAC candidates as businesses that had nowhere else to go.It could also broaden thinking about what size companies are appropriate to take public this way and lead to much bigger transactions.More certain: UWM isn’t likely to hold the record for ‘biggest SPAC deal ever’ for long. Not only is interest in SPACs as feverish as ever, but one vehicle in particular seems poised to take the title, and that’s the SPAC of billionaire investor William Ackman, whose blank-check company raised $4 billion last summer.Presumably, the deal will be a doozy. Reportedly, Ackerman was at one point looking to take public Airbnb with his SPAC. When Airbnb passed on the proposed merger, he reportedly reached out to the privately held media conglomerate Bloomberg. (Bloomberg has said it’s untrue.)Because SPACs typically complete a merger with a private company in two years or less, speculation has been running rampant about what Ackman — who plans to kick in an additional $1 billion in cash from his hedge fund — will piece together with all that money.In the meantime, there have been 67 new SPAC offerings in the last 22 days alone — as many as in all of 2019. They’ve raised $19.2 billion. And there’s seemingly no end to the fundraising in sight.Just this week, Fifth Wall Ventures, the four-year-old, L.A.-based proptech focused venture firm, registered plans to raise $250 million for a new blank-check company.Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak, who previously ran medical device giant Medtronic, was reported to be planning to raise between $750 million and $1 billion for a blank-check firm targeting deals in the health tech sector.As for Gores Group, on Wednesday, it registered plans to raise $400 million in an IPO for its newest blank-check company. It will be the outfit’s seventh SPAC to date.']",Share on Twitter ,"['NavigationClose', 'Lawrence Anareta / Getty ImagesWhile', 'Pontiac', 'United Wholesale Mortgage', 'U.S.Its', 'Gores Holdings IV', 'UWM', 'Gores Holdings IV', 'Alec Gores', 'Gores Group', 'UWM', 'Luminar Technologies', 'Virgin Galactic', 'Steve Jurvetson', 'Virgin Galactic', 'UMW', 'UWM', 'William Ackman', 'Ackerman', 'Bloomberg', 'Ackman', 'Fifth Wall Ventures', 'Intel', 'Omar Ishrak', 'Medtronic', 'Gores Group', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Loizos3:45 AM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/kMlxSM2TbT,2021-01-22T20:02:00,Drupal’s journey from dorm-room project to billion-dollar exit,"[""Twenty years ago Drupal and Acquia founder Dries Buytaert was a college student at the University of Antwerp. He wanted to put his burgeoning programming skills to work by building a communications tool for his dorm. That simple idea evolved over time into the open-source Drupal web content management system, and eventually a commercial company called Acquia built on top of it.Buytaert would later raise over $180 million and exit in 2019 when the company was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $1 billion, but it took 18 years of hard work to reach that point. \n\t\t\tWhen Drupal came along in the early 2000s, it wasn’t the only open-source option, but it was part of a major movement toward giving companies options by democratizing web content management.\t\t\t\t\tMany startups are built on open source today, but back in the early 2000s, there were only a few trail blazers and none that had taken the path that Acquia took. Buytaert and his co-founders decided to reduce the complexity of configuring a Drupal installation by building a hosted cloud service.That seems like a no-brainer now, but consider at the time in 2009, AWS was still a fledgling side project at Amazon, not the $45 billion behemoth it is today. In 2021, building a startup on top of an open-source project with a SaaS version is a proven and common strategy. Back then nobody else had done it. As it turned out, taking the path less traveled worked out well for Acquia.Moving from dorm room to billion-dollar exit is the dream of every startup founder. Buytaert got there by being bold, working hard and thinking big. His story is compelling, but it also offers lessons for startup founders who also want to build something big.Born in the proverbial dorm roomIn the days before everyone had internet access and a phone in their pockets, Buytaert simply wanted to build a way for him and his friends to communicate in a centralized way. “I wanted to build kind of an internal message board really to communicate with the other people in the dorm, and it was literally talking about things like ‘Hey, let’s grab a drink at 8:00,'” Buytaert told me.He also wanted to hone his programming skills. “At the same time I wanted to learn about PHP and MySQL, which at the time were emerging technologies, and so I figured I would spend a few evenings putting together a basic message board using PHP and MySQL, so that I could learn about these technologies, and then actually have something that we could use.”The resulting product served its purpose well, but when graduation beckoned, Buytaert realized if he unplugged his PC and moved on, the community he had built would die. At that point, he decided to move the site to the public internet and named it drop.org, which was actually an accident. Originally, he meant to register dorp.org because “dorp” is Dutch for “village or small community,” but he mistakenly inverted the letters during registration.Buytaert continued adding features to drop.org like diaries (a precursor to blogging) and RSS feeds. Eventually, he came up with the idea of open-sourcing the software that ran the site, calling it Drupal.The birth of web content managementAbout the same time Buytaert was developing the basis of what would become Drupal, web content management (WCM) was a fresh market. Early websites had been fairly simple and straightforward, but they were growing more complex in the late 90s and a bunch of startups were trying to solve the problem of managing them. Buytaert likely didn’t know it, but there was an industry waiting for an open-source tool like Drupal.""]",Apple’s new Fitness+ feature brings celebrity-guided walks to your wrist,"['Miller@ron_miller / 9:02 PM GMT+1•January 22', 'Acquia', 'Dries Buytaert', 'the University of Antwerp', 'Acquia', 'Vista Equity Partners', 'Acquia', 'Amazon', 'SaaS', 'Acquia', 'Buytaert', 'PHP', 'PHP', 'RSS', 'Buytaert', 'WCM', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsCloudEnterpriseFundings & ExitsM&ASaaSTCAcquiadries', 'Dries Buytaert', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

We believed then, as we do now, that fintech represents one of the most exciting major innovation cycles of this decade. In 2020, all the long-term trends forcing change in this sector continued and even accelerated.The broad movement away from credit toward debit, particularly among younger consumers, represents one such macro shift. However, the pandemic also created new, unforeseen drivers. Among them, millennials decamped from their rentals in crowded cities to accelerate their first home purchases to the benefit of proptech companies and challenger mortgage players alike.E-commerce saw an enormous acceleration in growth rates, furthering adoption of online payments platforms. Lastly, low interest rates and looming inflation helped pave the way for the price of Bitcoin to charge toward $30,000. In short, multiple tailwinds combined to produce a blockbuster year for the category.In this year’s refresh of the Matrix Fintech Index, we’ll divide our attention into three parts. First, a look at the public stocks’ performance. Second, liquidity. Third, we highlight one major trend in the sector: Buy Now Pay Later, or BNPL.Public\xa0fintech\xa0stocks rose 97% in 2020For the fourth straight year, the publicly traded fintechs massively outperformed the incumbent financial services providers as well as every mainstream stock index.

https://t.co/omKxVGQxoy,2021-01-25T20:33:24,Walking with Dolly,"['A walk is, more often than not, a solitary experience. As far as the age of COVID-19 is concerned, that’s probably more bug than feature. It’s a way to escape the confines of a shutdown for a few glorious moments, to get some air and, for better or worse, reflect on the day that’s passed or the one to come.It can, like many things these days, however, be isolating.For me, long weekend walks have been a sort of lifesaver throughout this bizarre year. Following two months of being completely sidelined over (non-COVID) health issues, I began walking more per week than I ever have. It was a slow process at first — frankly, never leaving my one-bedroom apartment for April and May made it so it was physically painful to walk around the block when I finally felt comfortable going outside.These days, I walk every morning, regularly crossing the bridge into Brooklyn and Manhattan. Until I started using Apple’s new Fitness+ service a few times a day, it was easily my main source of exercise. In November, however, my Apple Watch Activity bars swapped the more generic gray for the Fitness+ yellow. But even as I’ve made a point to do a couple of indoor exercises a day, I still start each day with a walk. Rain, snow, this weekend’s sub-freezing weather — skipping a day would feel like breaking a promise to myself.My actual bars (not sure what happened in September — maybe testing a competitor’s device)This morning Apple dropped the first five installments (episodes?) of Time to Walk. The feature is an attempt to expand the Fitness+ experience beyond the confines of its titular iOS app. A largely Watch-based experience, the feature leverages much of the wearable’s existing features (and Apple’s growing software ecosystem) to offer a more tailored and multimedia experience than you would get listening to a podcast or music alone.As with the canny arrival of Fitness+ (December) and handwashing for watchOS (September), Apple says the timing was something of a happy coincidence. The company had been working on the feature well before COVID-19 entered the picture.“Everything from Time to Walk and our launch of Fitness+ was something we had been working on well before COVID,” the company’s senior director of Fitness Technologies Jay Blahnik tells TechCrunch. “From the very beginning, we thought of Fitness+ as a place where everyone was welcome. We wanted it to feel like a place where, whether you’re new to fitness or very fit, there was something for everyone.”For many, a walk (or push, in the case of those who use a wheelchair for mobility) is square one when it comes to daily workouts. For my part, I was certainly far more comfortable taking quick strolls around the neighborhood. With limits on space and no real exercise equipment to speak of beyond a kettlebell and yoga mat, attempting to approximate the gym experience at home has seemed a fool’s errand.April found me trying some YouTube yoga classes with limited efficacy. Like most attempts to exercise, it didn’t stick. Walking every day was the only thing that did. And for the first time in my life, COVID-19 found me walking without any particular destination in mind. That old cliché about it being about the journey not the destination is fine when you don’t mind constantly being late to meetings. Walking for the sake of itself, however, changes the dynamic significantly. I speak to artists, writers and musicians on a regular basis for my podcast. The common sentiment is a familiar one: You simply can’t force creativity. But for those who make a point to regularly walk and run, it’s perhaps the most surefire way to kickstart the process.Apple’s new Fitness+ feature brings celebrity-guided walks to your wristTime to Walk is Apple’s attempt to capture some of that lightning in a bottle — to follow a rotating cast of big names as they walk through locations that mean something to them. The company says it’s been making an effort to meet guests where they are and essentially coach them through the process. The ability to do so is, of course, depends on their given location — especially with all of the sorts of travel restrictions that have been in place since early last year.Ultimately, Apple says, the decisions of where to record are made by the guests. “Some guests said, ‘this is where I want to go,’ ” says Blahnik. “And some guests were like, ‘no, I want to to do the walk I normally do.’ For us, it’s not about Shawn Mendes in the Grand Canyon, it’s about where they want to go. Sometimes that’s limited by COVID, but what we found delightful was for many people, they loved to take the walk they loved to take.”The first four guests — Mendes, Dolly Parton, Draymond Green and Uzo Aduba — run the gamut on approaches. “We think about the stories, we think about the diverse guest,” says Blahnik. We think about all of the ways you’d like the conversations to go. But what was important to us was that the idea resonated with them. The idea of going out for a walk, having a lovely conversation and hearing stories that could give you a different perspective.”Parton, who turned 75 earlier this month, recorded her session in a studio — in contrast to the other three names. She relates a handful of stories largely revolving around her upbringing in Sevier County (pronounced “severe”), Tennessee. There’s a story about a Christmas tree and one about opening a literacy center with the help of her father (who struggled with his own ability to read and write).She somewhat self-effacingly relates a story about the time her hometown erected a statue of her. “So I went home, and I said, ‘Daddy, did you know they’re putting a statue of me? Do you know about the statue down at the courthouse?’ ” Parton explains. “And Daddy said, ‘Well, yeah, I heard about that.’ He said, ‘Now, to your fans out there, you might be some sort of an idol. But to them pigeons, you ain’t nothing but another outhouse.’ ”According to Parton, her father would visit the statue at night with a bucket of soap and water to clean the pigeons’ mess off his daughter’s likeness. Her segment culminates with something approaching a behind the music-style segment, describing stories behind three of her own songs: “Coat of Many Colors,” “Circle of Love” and “9 to 5.” The latter is the real gem of the bunch, contrasting her morning routines to costars Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, while describing the role her acrylic nails played in the songwriting and recording process.Image Credits: AppleGreen’s stories are more emblematic of the rest. On a walk around Malibu, the Warriors power forward discusses some inspiration stories on and off the court, from being told he would never be a star to a time he tried and failed to cheat on a test in school. The stories are purposefully personal. Aduba relates some of her own struggles to break into acting, as she walks her amusingly named dog Fenway Bark through Fort Green Park in Brooklyn.The guests share images relating to their stories or snapshots of where they go on their walks, which are delivered to the wrist with a haptic buzz. At they end of the journey, they share three handpicked songs that can be saved to a playlist on Apple Music, similar to what the company has done for its Fitness+ workouts.Write-ups of the Time to Walk have thus far compared it to podcasting — understandably so, given that it’s an on-demand, audio-first experience. Though the feature, which downloads directly onto the Watch when the new installment drops once a week, has its own flavor, according to Apple.“Often podcasts are hosted,” Blahnik says, by way of distinction. “In our journey to build out this experience, we certainly considered if there should be a host walking with this person. What we realized is that, for what we were trying to create, the intimacy of having the singular guest talk to you felt a lot more like you were on a walk with them. The notion that it’s not happening in a studio (in almost all cases), that they’re walking someplace that inspires them. You’ll hear that with Draymond and Shawn — with Shawn he’s huffing and puffing up that hill and it’s kind of nice because you’re in that moment together.”Time to Walk isn’t raw, exactly. It is an Apple production, after all. The company’s certainly not tossing out found audio here. But the content does seem more off-the-cuff than many of its productions, even as it’s packaged together with a slick intro and a trio of songs at the end. But\xa0it’s a nice change of pace for those looking for something that feels a little more personal than we’re accustom to from some of the names involved.Your own mileage will vary, depending on, among other things, your interest in the guest. Though, there’s always a chance someone you’ve never been particularly interested in — or even heard of — will offer some unique tidbit or interesting way of looking at things. That’s one of the potential upsides of having Apple doing the curating here — there’s some interesting potential for discovery. And even in the case of artists you’re familiar with, there’s good potential to discover something new.The weekly 20 to 45-minute audio supplement won’t make the actual act of walking any less solitary — but for a little while, at least, it’s nice to feel like someone’s along for the ride.It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat']",new S-1 document,"['WireImage / Getty Images', 'Apple', 'Apple Watch Activity', '’ve', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'COVID-19', 'Fitness Technologies', 'Jay Blahnik', 'YouTube', 'COVID-19', 'Apple', 'Walk', 'Apple’s', 'Apple', 'Blahnik', 'Shawn Mendes', 'Mendes', 'Draymond Green', 'Uzo Aduba', 'Blahnik', 'Parton', 'Parton', 'Jane Fonda', 'Lily Tomlin', 'AppleGreen', 'Warriors', 'Aduba', 'dog Fenway Bark', 'Apple Music', 'Apple', 'Blahnik', 'Shawn', 'Shawn', 'Walk', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Brian Heater9:33', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/nq0X9FprRO,2021-01-25T20:10:39,Facebook will give academic researchers access to 2020 election ad targeting data,"['Starting next month, Facebook will open up academic access to a dataset of 1.3 million political and social issue ads, including those that ran between August 3 and November 3, 2020 — Election Day in the U.S.Facebook’s Ad Library, launched in 2019, offers a searchable database of all ads running on Facebook and Instagram. Implemented after the 2016 Russian election interference fiasco, the database allows researchers and reporters to drill down into ads by topic, company and candidate, displaying data about when an ad ran, who saw it and how much it cost.Facebook says the decision to offer a deeper look into ads on the platform comes after feedback from the research community, which specifically requested more information about targeting. Facebook’s extremely granular ad targeting tools are of particular interest to researchers, who will soon have access to why certain people saw ads, including data on location and interest.“We recognize that understanding the online political advertising landscape is key to protecting elections, and we know we can’t do it alone,” Facebook Product Manager Sarah Clark Schiff wrote in the announcement.The company’s ad targeting systems have plunged the company into hot water in the past. In 2016, Facebook disabled a targeting option for “ethnic affinity” in credit, housing and employment-related ad categories following reporting on how those tools could be abused for illegal discrimination. In 2018, the company removed 5,000 additional ad targeting options due to similar potential for discriminatory advertising practices. And the extent to which the Trump campaign sailed into the White House on the strength of its microtargeting Facebook ad operations is still a matter of debate.Regardless of how you feel about the tools themselves, Facebook’s public-facing ad library has been an invaluable tool for reporters, providing both issue-specific deep dives and an easy at-a-glance view of political spending by party, race and candidate. The new targeting data won’t live on the public Ad Library but will instead be limited to the Facebook Open Research & Transparency platform, which is only accessible by university-linked researchers.Facebook is removing over 5,000 ad targeting options to prevent discriminatory ads']",enfant terrible of high finance,"['NavigationClose', 'Hatmaker@tayhatmaker', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Sarah Clark Schiff', 'Trump', 'the Facebook Open Research & Transparency', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Hatmaker9:10', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The new filing raises Qualtrics’ expected IPO price range, providing the Utah-based unicorn with a higher potential valuation in its impending debut.Qualtrics previously sold to SAP for $8 billion while on the path to going public; after a time inside the larger software company, Qualtrics announced it would spin out as its own public company. TechCrunch previously explored the company’s initial IPO filing and its first IPO pricing interval.At the time, we described it as just that: Qualtrics’ first IPO price range. We expected the company to raise its targets. Why? At its initial $22 to $26 per-share price range, it simply felt undervalued compared to current-market analogs and benchmarks.Let’s talk about its new price range.PricingQualtrics is a SaaS company that is growing at a moderate clip and is nearly break-even if you remove the cost of share-based compensation. And at a run rate of around $800 million in its most recent quarter, it’s a large firm.So it’s not just another fast-growing SaaS firm that’s crested $100 million in ARR that is still running stiff deficits, it’s a different beast. That makes the effort to triangulate its valuation all the more fun.At its new interval and with some minor share-count tweaks detailed in its new filing, Qualtrics will raise as much as $1.68 billion in its debut, a figure that is exclusive of some transactions associated with the IPO.With its new $27 to $29 per-share IPO price range, Qualtrics is shooting a little bit higher than before.

https://t.co/RrUZd1W2pW,2021-01-25T18:46:09,Chamath Palihapitiya’s SPAC for Sunlight Financial is another sign of a renewables boom,"['Former Facebook employee and current enfant terrible of high finance Chamath Palihapitiya is making news again with a $1.3 billion twofer SPAC and PIPE deal into the solar energy financing company, Sunlight Financial.Sunlight Financial is essentially a lending company that gives solar installers a way to provide loans to homeowners to finance solar power and battery installations and other home improvement projects.While it may be another indication of the Roaring ’20s come back to haunt global financial markets in the lead-up to a catastrophic meltdown of the global financial system, there’s at least some method to the madness with Sunlight.That’s because there’s a lot of tailwinds behind a business that’s lending money to provide better access to solar power, energy storage and energy efficiency upgrades.A Biden presidency doesn’t need a Green New Deal to make progress on climate changeThe investment, alongside Coatue, Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, will value the lender at $1.3 billion. A healthy figure, but one that’s not astronomical, especially given the $705 million in financing that Sunlight Financial has raised over its history, according to Crunchbase.As Alex Wilhelm noted earlier today, Sunlight Financial would have likely tapped public markets sooner or later, given a pretty solid financial performance — even during the pandemic:Looking at the numbers, it’s somewhat clear that the company could have gone public in a year or two; another year’s growth, and it would have had enough revenue to pursue a traditional debut. Via this SPAC-led deal it will get out sooner and have more cash while it scales. Perhaps that is the value of the SPAC here for Sunlight.Sunlight also has the benefit of being a publicly traded renewable energy play at a time when those companies are in short supply and high demand from institutional investors.Over the course of 2020, big money moved to find ways to support businesses that can help mitigate the effects of climate change or slow the rapidly warming temperatures on the planet.“Industry commitments to mitigate climate change risk is providing investors with visibility that there is momentum among decision-makers to drive change,” said Richard Manley, the managing director and head of sustainable investing at CPP Investments, in an interview last year. “There’s an appreciation within the public markets that the exciting transition solutions either within core operating subsidiaries or investments in the VC arms of corporate companies haven’t provided public equity investors the really focused opportunities they’ve wanted.”What’s behind this year’s boom in climate tech SPACs?With the launch of Palihapitiya’s latest SPAC, that trend seems set to continue in 2021. As Rob Day, a longtime investor in climate tech wrote in a direct message late last year:“[The] current wave [of SPACs] is because over the past 24 months the institutional investor universe has come fully into believing that climate solutions are going to be a major growth area in the 2020s and beyond, but they weren’t seeing options available to them for investing into,” according to Day.“The available publicly traded ‘green’ companies were already getting really bought up, and the private equity options were underwhelming as well (smallish in the case of VC, low returns in the case of large-format projects). Throw in a Robinhood market of retail investors with a lot of enthusiasm for EVs and such, and you have a nice recipe for this to happen.”']",to form a union,"['Michael Kovac/Getty Images', 'PIPE', 'Biden', 'Coatue', 'Franklin Templeton', 'BlackRock', 'Sunlight Financial', 'Crunchbase', 'Alex Wilhelm', 'Richard Manley', 'CPP Investments', 'VC', 'Rob Day', 'VC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'TempletonPrivate EquitySolar', 'PIPE', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/tJKhOsSlXx,2021-01-25T18:35:22,Twitter’s Birdwatch fights misinformation with community notes,"['Twitter is launching what it calls “a community-based approach to misinformation.”The Birdwatch project first came to light last fall thanks to product sleuth Jane Manchun Wong. Now Twitter has launched a pilot version via the Birdwatch website.The goal, as explained in a blog post by Twitter’s Vice President of Product Keith Coleman, is to expand beyond the labels that the company already applies to controversial or potentially misleading tweets, which he suggested are limited to “circumstances where something breaks our rules or receives widespread public attention.”Coleman wrote that the Birdwatch approach will “broaden the range of voices that are part of tackling this problem.” That brings more perspectives to these issues and goes beyond the simple question of, “Is this tweet true or not?” It may also take some of the heat off Twitter for individual content moderation decisions.Twitter is building ‘Birdwatch,’ a system to fight misinformation by adding more context to tweetsUsers can sign up on the Birdwatch site to flag tweets that they find misleading, add context via notes and rate the notes written by other contributors based on whether they’re helpful or not. These notes will only be visible on the Birdwatch site for now, but it sounds like the company’s goal is to incorporate them to the main Twitter experience.“We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable,” Coleman said. “Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors.”Given the potential for plenty of argument and back-and-froth on contentious tweets, it remains to be seen how Twitter will present these notes in a way that isn’t confusing or overwhelming, or how it can avoid weighing in on some of these arguments. The company said Birdwatch will use rank content based on algorithmic “reputation and consensus systems,” with the code shared publicly. (All notes contributed to Birdwatch will also be available for download.) You can read more about the initial ranking system here.“We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors,” Coleman said. “We’ll be focused on these things throughout the pilot.”Twitter may slow down users’ ability to ‘like’ tweets containing misinformation']",competition concerns,"['Twitter’s Birdwatch', 'NavigationClose', 'notesAnthony Ha@anthonyha /', 'Justin Sullivan/Getty Images / Getty ImagesTwitter', 'Jane Manchun Wong', 'Twitter', 'Twitter’s', 'Keith Coleman', 'Coleman', 'Tweets', 'Coleman', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Manchun WongKeith ColemanTwitterTwitter’s Birdwatch', 'notesAnthony Ha7:35', 'Jane Manchun Wong', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/SCOGY6y2uo,2021-01-25T17:46:57,Google claims almost no change in ad revenue from targeting proposals in its Privacy Sandbox — but privacy upside less clear,"['As Google’s Privacy Sandbox remains under scrutiny over competition concerns, the tech giant has released an update claiming experimental ad-targeting techniques it’s developing as part of the plan to depreciate support for third-party cookies on its Chrome browser show results that are “nearly as effective as cookie-based approaches”.Google has been working on a technique — called Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) — to target ads based on clustering users into groups with similar interests, which it claims is superior from a privacy perspective versus the current (dysfunctional) “norm” of targeting individuals based on third parties tracking everything they do online.It wants FLoCs to enable interest-based advertising to continue after it ends support for third-party trackers.Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two yearsHowever, the proposal has alarmed advertisers who argue it’s anti-competitive. And earlier this month the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation of the Privacy Sandbox proposal after complaints from a coalition of digital marketing companies and others from newspapers and technology companies alleging Google is abusing a dominant position by depreciating support for third-party trackers.On the privacy front, Google’s self-styled Privacy Sandbox isn’t exactly attracting effusive plaudits, either.The Electronic Frontier Foundation has, for example, dubbed FLoCs “the opposite of privacy-preserving technology” — warning in 2019 that the approach is akin to a “behavioral credit score”. It said then that the proposals risk sustaining discrimination against vulnerable groups of people, whose online activity would be pattern-matched with others without their say-so; and could also lead to leaking sensitive info about them to third parties — without offering web users any way to escape being put in an “interest based” ad targeting bucket.\xa0With objections piling up on sides of the aisle (advertiser versus user) — and now active regulatory scrutiny of the competition issue — Google has its work cut out to sell its preferred replacement for tracking cookies to all the relevant stakeholders. Though advertisers (and competition regulators) currently seem front of mind for the tech giant.In an update about the Privacy Sandbox proposals today, Google appears to be hoping to alleviate advertisers’ concerns that the demise of tracking cookies will degrade their ability to lucratively target internet users — writing that tests of the FLoC technology suggest advertisers will continue to see “at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising”.It’s not clear how much test data was involved in Google generating that percentage, however. (We asked and Google did not have an immediate response.) So there’s zero meat on the bone of the “95% minimum” claim.Its spokesman did note that it will be opening up public testing in March — and expects advertisers to join in kicking FLoC’s tires then. So there’s clearly going to be more detail to come on this front.“Chrome intends to make FLoC-based cohorts available for public testing through origin trials with its next release in March and we expect to begin testing FLoC-based cohorts with advertisers in Google Ads in Q2,” writes Chetna Bindra, group product manager for user trust and privacy in the blog post, adding: “If you’d like to get a head start, you can run your own simulations (as we did) based on the principles outlined in this FLoC whitepaper.”It’s unsurprising that Google continues to emphasize the relative openness with which it’s developing the Privacy Sandbox proposals — as that may help it fight antitrust accusations. But it’s also noteworthy being as the adtech industry, which has been fighting to block/delay its depreciation of third-party cookies, is busy spinning up its own contenders to replace trackers — and developing those competing proposals typically with a lot less transparency than Google.Google proposes new privacy and anti-fingerprinting controls for the webNonetheless, Google seems a whole lot more comfortable quantifying FLoC’s potential impact on ad revenue (tiny, per its latest claim) versus articulating what privacy gains internet users might expect from the proposed shift from individual tracking to run behavioral ads to being stuck in labelled buckets to run behavioral ads.Google’s blog post has a few fuzzy mentions — like “viable privacy-first alternatives” and “hiding individuals ‘in the crowd’ ” — but there’s no metric or data offered on how much privacy users stand to gain if its preferred post-cookie future comes to pass.Test results it published in October also focused on seeking to demonstrate to advertisers that FLoCs can deliver on other relevant ad metrics. Funnily enough, internet users’ privacy — and what happens when degrees of privacy are lost — is rather harder for Google’s computer scientists to measure.""advertisers can expect to see at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising"". What\'s the per cent of privacy improvement? #GDPR #DigitalServicesAct #ePrivacy— Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) January 25, 2021“The idea is to make it so that no one can reconstruct your cross-site browsing history,” said the company’s spokesman when we asked about how the proposal will improve users’ privacy standing.“We’re trying to address non-transparent forms of tracking, across websites, with privacy-safe mechanisms for consumers, and make it so it can’t happen. And to do so while still enabling opportunity and fair compensation for publishers and advertisers. So it’s really not even a matter of trying to approximate a kind of privacy: We’re trying to address a root critical concern of users, full stop,” he added.FLoCs are just one part of Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals. The company is working on a slew of aligned efforts to simultaneously replace various other key components of the adtech ecosystem. And it gives an overview of some of these in the blog post — covering proposals for (post-cookie) conversation measurement; ad-fraud prevention; and anti-fingerprinting.Here it dwells briefly on retargeting/remarketing — referring to a new Chrome proposal (called Fledge) that it says it’s considering for a “trusted server” model “specifically designed to store information about a campaign’s bids and budgets”. This will also be made available for advertisers to test later this year, Google adds.“Over the last year, several members of the ad tech community have offered input for how this might work, including proposals from Criteo, NextRoll, Magnite and RTB House. Chrome has published a new proposal called FLEDGE\xa0that expands on a previous Chrome proposal (called\xa0TURTLEDOVE) and takes into account the industry feedback they’ve heard, including the idea of using a “trusted server” — as defined by compliance with certain principles and policies — that’s specifically designed to store information about a campaign’s bids and budgets. Chrome intends to make FLEDGE available for testing through origin trials later this year with the opportunity for ad tech companies to try using the API under a “bring your own server” model,” it writes.“Technology advancements such as FLoC, along with similar promising efforts in areas like measurement, fraud protection and anti-fingerprinting, are the future of web advertising — and the Privacy Sandbox will power our web products in a post-third-party cookie world,” it adds.Discussing Fledge’s potential, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, an independent researcher and consultant, said there’s still a lot of uncertainty over how it might impact user privacy. “The Fledge experiment looks potentially interesting but it mixes in various proposals in this test.

Sunlight Financial, which offers point-of-sale financing for residential solar systems, has raised north of $700 million in venture capital, private equity and debt.We’re going to chat about the two transactions.There’s no escaping SPACs for a bit, so if you are tired of watching blind pools rip private companies into the public markets, you are not going to have a very good next few months. Why? There are nearly 300 SPACs in the market today looking for deals, and many will find one.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.Think of SPACs are increasingly hungry sharks. As a shark get hungrier while the clock winds down on its deal-making window, it may get less choosy about what it eats (take public). There are enough SPACs on the hunt today that they would be noisy even if they were not time-constrained investment vehicles. But as their timers tick, expect their deal-making to get all the more creative.This brings us back to Chamath’s two deals. Are they more like the Bakkt SPAC, which led us to raise a few questions? Or more akin to the Talkspace SPAC, which we found pretty reasonable?\xa0Let’s find out.Keyless locks = Peloton for real estateLet’s start with the Latch deal.New York-based Latch sells “LatchOS,” a hardware and software system that works in buildings where access and amenities matter. Latch’s hardware works with doors, sensors and internet connectivity.The company has raised a number of private rounds, including a $126 million deal in August of 2019 that valued the company at $454.3 million on a post-money basis, according to PitchBook data. The company raised another $30 million in October of 2020, though its final private valuation is not known.As Chamath tweeted this morning, Latch is merging with TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp, or $TSIA. The SPAC is associated with Tishman Speyer, a commercial real estate investor. You can see the synergies, as Latch’s products fit into the commercial real estate space.Up front, Latch is not a company that is only reporting future revenues. It has a history as an operating entity. Indeed, here’s its financial data per its investor presentation:Image Credits: LatchDoing some quick match, Latch grew booked revenues 50.5% from 2019 to 2020. Its booked software revenues grew 37.1%, while its booked hardware top line expanded over 70% during the same period.That could be due to strong hardware installation fees, which could later result in software revenues; the company claims an average of a six-year software deal, so hardware revenues that are attached to new software incomes could low key declaim long-term SaaS revenues.Update: Adding some clarity here, the above are “booked” revenues, which I’ve made more clear, not actual revenues. Its net revenues, better known as actual revenues, were $18 million, with $14 million of that coming from hardware. So, today, the company is certainly more hardware-heavy than I first thought. Damn non-S-1 filings!While some were quick to note that the company is far from pure-SaaS — correct — I suspect that the model that could get some traction amongst investors is that this feels a bit like Peloton for real estate. How so? Peloton has large hardware incomes up front from new users, which convert to long-term subscription revenues. Latch may prove similar, albeit for a different customer base and market.Per the deal’s reported terms, Latch will be worth $1.56 billion after the transaction.

The round also saw participation from a handful of individual investors including Robert F. Smith, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Baron Davis, Sterling K. Brown, Ryan Bathe, CC Sabathia and Amber Sabathia.Goalsetter launched in 2019 out of the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator. Founded by Tanya Van Court, who lost over $1 million in the 2001 bubble burst, the platform teaches financial literacy to children of all ages, helping them learn economic concepts, lingo and the principles of financial health.After long stints at Nickelodeon and ESPN, Van Court understands deeply how kids learn and what keeps their attention. She vowed to make sure that her children were never ignorant of what it takes to protect their wealth and create more.The app also allows parents to give allowances through the app, and even pay out their own specified amount for every quiz question the kid gets right in the app. Plus, family and friends can give “goal cards” instead of gift cards, helping kids save for the things they really want in the future.The company recently launched a debit card for kids, as well, letting parents control the way the card is used and even lock it until their kids have passed the week’s financial literacy quiz.Families save an average of $120 a month on the platform, and Van Court says that two families saved over $10,000 in the last year.The company is also launching a massive campaign next week for Black History Month with the goal of closing the wealth gap among Black children and kids of color\xa0through financial education.“It’s one thing to put a debit card into your teenager’s hands,” said Van Court. “That’s great. That teaches them how to spend money. It’s another thing to teach kids the core concepts about how to build wealth, or to know the difference between putting your money into an investment account, or putting your money into a CD versus a mutual fund versus a savings account. We teach what interest rates are, and what compound interest means. Our focus is on financial education because it’s not enough to teach kids how to spend.”Goalsetter raised $2.1 million in 2019 and now adds this latest round to that for a total of $6 million raised. This latest round was oversubscribed, giving Van Court the opportunity to be super selective about her investors.“Every single one of these investors has a demonstrated commitment prior to people marching in the streets in April, to social justice and to investing in diversity and inclusion initiatives and people,” said Van Court. “Every single one of them. That was really important because we were oversubscribed and we had the luxury of being able to pick who our investors were. Every one of the investors that we invited to our table were investors who we knew invited folks who look like us in 2019 and 2018 and 2017 to their table.”Goalsetter gives parents a way to teach their kids how to save money']",The Pill Club,"['NavigationClose', 'GoalsetterGoalsetter', 'Astia', 'PNC Bank', 'U.S. Bank', 'Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures', 'Elevate Capital', 'Rising America Fund and Pipeline Angels', 'Robert F.

Image Credits: The Pill ClubAs it faces an uncertain legal environment on some fronts, the company couldn’t be in a better position financially.The Pill Club, which is profitable and now has a $100 million run rate, is now ready for its closeup with Meyerdirk at the helm.The company has managed to make its mark in the crowded world of online prescriptions and refill fulfillment by focusing specifically on women’s health and ensuring that those services are available to as many potential patients as possible.“We’re now serving hundreds of thousands of women nationwide with 20% on Medicaid,” says Meyerdirk. “We prescribe in 43 states and the District of Columbia.”For Meyerdirk, the background she had in logistics and fulfillment from her time at Uber Eats made the transition to the pill prescription and delivery service natural.“There is a heavy logistics element to it,” said Meyerdirk.As Meyerdirk takes the reins of the company, she said there’s a few areas that The Pill Club will expand into beyond its focus on birth control and contraception. “There are areas that our customers are asking for,” Meyerdirk said.These areas include, initially, dermatology. Last year the company launched a delivery service for contraceptives and women’s hygiene products like pads and tampons.As it continues to expand its product suite, it’s also growing its executive staff. The company not only added Meyerdirk, but also David Hsu as chief financial officer and Jeremy Downs as senior vice president of growth. Hsu joins the company from Honey, where he led the $4 billion acquisition negotiations with PayPal, and Downs comes from Uber Eats, where he spent five years leading growth.“We need sustained, long-term access to women’s healthcare, not just a bridge while the pandemic persists; and we need coverage for essential health services like birth control and prenatal care, regardless of whether or not you’re insured,” Meyerdirk wrote. “Reproductive care has and continues to be an essential part of our business, but there are countless opportunities to serve women in all of their life stages from puberty to menopause.”Connecting employer healthcare plans to surgical centers of excellence nets Carrum Health $40 million']",BlackCart,"['The Pill Club', 'Liz Meyerdirk', 'The Pill Club', 'Liz Meyerdirk', 'Getty ImagesLiz Meyerdirk', 'The Pill Club', 'the Supreme Court', 'Meyerdirk', 'COVID-19', 'the Supreme Court', 'ACA', 'Meyerdirk', 'Meyerdirk', 'Liz Meyerdirk', 'The Pill Club', 'The Pill Club', 'Meyerdirk', 'Medicaid', 'Meyerdirk', 'Meyerdirk', 'Meyerdirk', 'Meyerdirk', 'The Pill Club', 'Meyerdirk', 'Meyerdirk', 'David Hsu', 'Jeremy Downs', 'Hsu', 'Honey', 'PayPal', 'Downs', 'Uber Eats', 'Meyerdirk', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'The Pill Club', 'Liz Meyerdirk', 'CEOJonathan Shieber4:58', 'Meyerdirk', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/duvZ2pbQ7p,2021-01-25T15:54:59,Virgin Orbit will launch first Dutch defense satellite in mission that will demo rapid response capabilities,"['Virgin Orbit isn’t slowing down after joining the exclusive club of small launch companies that have made it to orbit — the company just announced that it’s flying a payload on behalf of the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNAF). This is the first-ever satellite being put up by the Dutch Ministry of Defense, and it’s a small satellite that will act as a test platform for a number of different communications experiments.The satellite is called BRIK-II — not because it’s the second of its kind, but rather because it’s named after Brik, the first airplane ever owned and operated by the RNAF. This mission is one of Virgin Orbit’s first commercial operations after its successful test demonstration and will fly sometime later this year. It’s also being planned as a rideshare mission, with other payloads expected to join — likely from the U.S. Department of Defense, which is working with Virgin Orbit’s dedicated U.S. defense industry subsidiary VOX Space on planning what they’ll be adding to the mission load out.This upcoming mission is actually a key demonstration of a number of Virgin Orbit’s unique advantages in the launch market. For one, it’ll show how the U.S. DOD and its ally defense agencies can work together in the space domain when launching small communications satellites. Virgin Orbit is also going to use the mission as an opportunity to show off its “late-load integration” capabilities — effectively, how it can add a payload to its LauncherOne rocket just prior to launch.For this particular flight, there’s no real reason to do a late-load integration, since there’s plenty of lead time, but part of Virgin’s appeal is being able to nimbly add satellites to its rocket just before the carrier jet that flies it to its take-off altitude leaves the runway. Demonstrating that will go a long way to help illustrate how it differentiates its services from others in the launch market, such as Rocket Lab and SpaceX.Watch Virgin Orbit launch a rocket to space from a modified 747 for the first time']",Melio,"['NavigationClose ScreenVirgin Orbit', 'the Royal Netherlands Air Force', 'the Dutch Ministry of Defense', 'BRIK-II', 'RNAF', 'Virgin Orbit’s', 'the U.S. Department of Defense', 'Virgin Orbit’s', 'VOX Space', 'Virgin Orbit’s', 'Virgin Orbit', 'LauncherOne', 'Virgin’s', 'Rocket Lab', 'Virgin Orbit', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Orbit', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/3mG9wPh9uJ,2021-01-25T15:48:17,BlackCart raises $8.8M Series A for its try-before-you-buy platform for online merchants,"['A startup called BlackCart is tackling one of the key challenges with online shopping: an inability to try on or test out the merchandise before making a purchase. That company, which has now closed on $8.8 million in Series A funding, has built a try-before-you-buy platform that integrates with e-commerce storefronts, allowing customers to ship items to their home for free and only pay if they choose to keep the item after a “try on” period has lapsed.The new round of financing was led by Origin Ventures and Hyde Park Ventures Partners, and saw participation from Struck Capital, Citi Ventures, 500 Startups and several other angel investors, including Christian Sullivan of Republic Labs, Dean Bakes of M3 Ventures, Greg Rudin of Menlo Ventures, Jordan Nathan of Caraway Cookware and First National Bank CFO Nick Pirollo, among others.The Toronto-based company last year had raised a $2 million seed.Image Credits: BlackCartBlackCart founder Donny Ouyang had previously founded online tutoring marketplace Rayku before joining a seed-stage VC fund, Caravan Ventures. But he was inspired to return to entrepreneurship, he says, after experiencing a personal problem with trying to order shoes online.Realizing the opportunity for a “try before you buy” type of service, Ouyang first built BlackCart in 2017 as a business-to-consumer (B2C) platform that worked by way of a Chrome extension with some 50 different online merchants, largely in apparel.This MVP of sorts proved there was consumer demand for something like this in online shopping.Ouyang credits the earlier version of BlackCart with helping the team to understand what sort of products work best for this service.“I think, in general, for try-before-you-buy, anything that’s moderate to higher price points, lower frequency of purchase, where the customer makes a considered purchase decision — those perform really well,” he says.Two years later, Ouyang took BlackCart to 500 Startups in San Francisco, where he then pivoted the business to the B2B offering it is today.Image Credits: BlackCartThe startup now provides a try-before-you-buy platform that integrates with online storefronts, including those from Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, Big Commerce, SalesForce Commerce Cloud, WordPress and even custom storefronts. The system is designed to be turnkey for online retailers and takes around 48 hours to set up on Shopify and around a week on Magento, for example.BlackCart has also developed its own proprietary technology around fraud detection, payments, returns and the overall user experience, which includes a button for retailers’ websites.Because the online shoppers aren’t paying upfront for the merchandise they’re being shipped, BlackCart has to rely on an expanded array of behavioral signals and data in order to make a determination about whether the customer represents a fraud risk. As one example, if the customer had read a lot of helpdesk articles about fraud before placing their order, that could be flagged as a negative signal.BlackCart also verifies the user’s phone number at checkout and matches it to telco and government data sets to see if their historical addresses match their shipping and billing addresses.Image Credits: BlackCartAfter the customer receives the item, they are able to keep it for a period of time (as designated by the retailer) before being charged. BlackCart covers any fraud as part of its value proposition to retailers.BlackCart makes money by way of a rev share model, where it charges retailers a percentage of the sales where the customers have kept the products. This amount can vary based on a number of factors, like the fraud multiplier, average order value, the type of product and others. At the low end, it’s around 4% and around 10% on the high end, Ouyang says.The company has also expanded beyond home try-on to include try-before-you-buy for electronics, jewelry, home goods and more. It can even ship out makeup samples for home try-on, as another option.Once integrated on a website, BlackCart claims its merchants typically see conversion increases of 24%, average order values climb by 51% and bottom-line sales growth of 27%.Koio, the D2C luxury sneaker brand, raises $6 millionTo date, the platform has been adopted by more than 50 medium-to-large retailers, as well as e-commerce startups, like luxury sneaker brand Koio, clothing startup Dia&Co, online mattress startup Helix Sleep and cookware startup Caraway, among others. It’s also under NDA now with a top-50 retailer it can’t yet name publicly, and has contracts signed with 13 others that are waiting to be onboarded.Soon, BlackCart aims to offer a self-serve onboarding process, Ouyang notes.“This would be later, end of Q2 or early Q3,” he says. “But I think for us, it will still be probably 80% self-serve, and then larger enterprises will want to be handheld.”With the additional funding, BlackCart aims to shift to paying the merchant immediately for the items at checkout, then reconciling afterwards in order to be more efficient. This has been one of merchants’ biggest feature requests, as well.Image Credits: BlackCart; team photoThe funding will also allow BlackCart to expand its remotely distributed 10-person team to around 50 by year-end, including engineers, product specialists, customer support staff and sales.More broadly, it aims to quickly capitalize on the growth in the e-commerce market, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.Cookware startup Caraway raises $5.3M as it eyes new product categories“[We want to] take advantage of the favorable macroeconomic situation to scale as quickly as possible,” Ouyang explains. “We’re hoping to get to around $250 million in transactions through our platform by the end of 2021. And this would be driven by both engineering and sales hires, and just pushing it up,” he says.Longer-term, Ouyang envisions adding more consumer-facing features to BlackCart’s platform, like on-demand returns where a courier comes to the house to pick up your return, for example.“Our firm is excited to partner with BlackCart as it makes try-before-you-buy the standard in online shopping,” said Prashant Shukla of Origin Ventures, who now sits on BlackCart’s board, as result of the new financing. “Its underwriting technology provides merchants with peace of mind, and its best-in-class consumer experience delivers significant sales and conversion lifts. Digital Native generations expect to be able to shop online exactly as they would in a retail store, and BlackCart is the only company providing this experience,” he adds.']",Equity,"['NavigationClose ScreenBlackCart', 'Origin Ventures', 'Hyde Park Ventures Partners', 'Struck Capital', 'Citi Ventures', 'Christian Sullivan', 'Republic Labs', 'Dean Bakes', 'M3 Ventures', 'Greg Rudin', 'Jordan Nathan', 'First National Bank CFO Nick Pirollo', 'Donny Ouyang', 'VC', 'Caravan Ventures', 'Ouyang', 'MVP', 'Ouyang', 'Magento', 'WooCommerce', 'Big Commerce', 'SalesForce Commerce Cloud', 'WordPress', 'Magento', 'Ouyang', 'D2C', 'Koio', 'NDA', 'Ouyang', 'Ouyang', 'Ouyang', 'Prashant Shukla of Origin Ventures', 'BlackCart’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Park Ventures Partnersmagentoonline', 'VenturesShopifyshoppingBlackCart', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/x5a9TCcgHI,2021-01-25T15:06:25,Melio raises $110M on a $1.3B valuation to bring B2B payments for SMBs into the 21st century,"['Payments for consumers have made a huge shift to the online world in the last year, a time when they have moved more of their purchasing to the internet to minimize in-person transactions in the midst of a virus-based health pandemic. Today, a startup that has built a similar kind of payments infrastructure — but specifically targeting small businesses and the payments they need to make — has raised a big round of funding to double down on its own slice of the market.Melio, which provides a platform for SMBs to pay other companies electronically using bank transfers, debit cards or credit — along with the option of cutting paper checks for recipients if that is what the recipients request — has closed $110 million in funding at a valuation that the company said was now $1.3 billion.The company’s focus to date has been building and growing a system to replace the paper invoices, snail mail and bank transfers that might take multiple days to clear and still dominate payments for small and medium enterprises. The company was founded in Israel but has to date focused a lot of its attention on the U.S. market, where it saw growth of 2,000% last year (it doesn’t disclose the actual number of customers that it has). CEO Matan Bar said that this is where the company will continue to focus for now.This latest round was led by Coatue and also included participation from previous backers Accel, Aleph, Bessemer Venture Partners, Corner Ventures, General Catalyst and Latitude. It caps off a huge year for the company, which raised $130 million in 2020 (and $256 million overall), with other recent backers including others like American Express and Salesforce.The latter two are strategic backers: AmEx is one of the options given to customers paying other businesses through Melio’s rails.Salesforce, meanwhile, is not yet an integration partner, but Bar — who co-founded the company with Ilan Atias and Ziv Paz (respectively CTO and COO) — described its interest as similar to that of Intuit-owned accounting giant QuickBooks. QuickBooks connects with Melio so that users of one can seamlessly import activity from one platform into the other, and Bar hinted that there is an interest from the CRM giant, which provides a number of other business and productivity tools, to work together in a similar fashion.Bar came to found Melio on the heels of years of experience in peer-to-peer payments focused on the consumer market. He previously ran PayPal’s business unit focused on peer-to-peer payments, which included Venmo in the U.S. and equivalent services (not branded Venmo) outside of it. He came to PayPal, which at the time was a part of eBay, through eBay’s acquisition of his previous startup, a social gifting platform called The Gifts Project.As Bar describes it, PayPal “was the first time I experienced what the digitization of payments looked like as they were shifting from cash to mobile payments. Consumers were buying online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores, and even when they were getting physical items, they were paying online.” What he quickly realized, though, was that the same was not applying to the businesses themselves.“There are still trillions being transferred via paper checks in the B2B space,” he said, with paper invoices and paper checks dominating the market. “The space is way behind other payment areas. I would be talking with SMB owners who would be using fancy Square or PayPal point of sale devices, but when they had to pay, say, a coffee bean supplier, they stuffed checks in envelopes. That’s very intriguing obviously, and it triggered our interest.”Interestingly this isn’t a problem that hasn’t been identified before, but many of the solutions, such as Bill.com or Tipalti, are really designed for larger enterprises. “They are too overwhelming for SMBs,” he said. “Even their names say it all:\xa0Accounts Payable Automation Solutions. It’s about tens of thousands of payments, and accounting departments, not an order from a wine shop.”Tipalti receives $150M at a $2B+ valuation after its accounts payable platform sees a surge in useThat formed the basis of what the startup started to build, which has been, in essence, a very pared-down version of these other payments platforms with SMB needs in mind.The first of these is a focus on cashflow, Bar said. Specifically, the Melio platform lets payments be made automatically but businesses themselves can delay the timing on when money actually leaves their accounts: “Buyers keep cash longer, vendors get paid faster,” is how Bar describes it.This is in part enabled by the tech that Melio has built, which builds in risk assessment, as well as fraud management, and balances payments across the whole of its platform to send money in and out without the need for the company to raise debt to back up those payments.“We leverage data to assess risk,” said Bar. “Every dollar in this round is going towards R&D and sales and marketing. We don’t need the capital in our model.” It also works with the likes of AmEx and its own credit system in cases where people are paying on credit, but Bar also noted that currently most of the transactions that happen on its platform are not credit based. Most are bank transfers.While others like Stripe have also built B2B payment services to pay out suppliers, Bar points out that what it has created is unique in that it is a standalone service: no need to be a part of Stripe’s wider ecosystem of services to use this if you already use another payments provider you are happy with.Given that focus on cashflow for SMBs, what’s also interesting is the low bar to entry that Melio has built into its platform. Specifically, the service is completely free for businesses to use — that is, no fee is charged — as long as companies are making bank transfers or using debit cards. It takes a 2.9% fee when a business elects to use a credit card for a transaction (and even then Melio says that the fee is tax deductible in the U.S.).He noted that one of the reasons that Melio has to date targeted the U.S. market is because of how antiquated it still is. “The average bank transfer still takes three to four business days, if you don’t want to take any risk,” he said. “We have developed models to do it same day. We take the risk that the buyer might not have the funds in that account but think about how that impacts cash flows. With Melio you still pay in three days, but money will be delivered the same day. That is how you can keep cash longer, without a payments risk.”Targeting a market that remains very underserved at a time when so much has gone virtual in payments is why investors are also interested.“Melio has identified both the opportunity and duty to help small businesses manage their finance remotely and improve cash flow, in normal times as well as during this crisis, as physical payments supply chains are interrupted and overwhelmed,” said\xa0Michael Gilroy, a general partner at Coatue, in a statement. “Going digital is the only way small businesses can compete against larger rivals and stay ahead of the curve.”In terms of more product development, Bar said that the company has\xa0received “a lot of incoming interest from partners to enable B2B payments within their products on their product,” similar to what QuickBooks is doing and Salesforce is likely to do. “Payments are contextual and they want to enable a quicker way to get there. The SMB is underserved. And yes, from a unit economics it’s much better to go after Nike. But this is also to really create some financial inclusion. We want to enable services for the small shop that the big guys already have.”All B2B startups are in the payments business']",TechCrunch List,"['SMBs', 'NavigationClose', 'SMBs', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Berg', 'Melio', 'Coatue', 'Accel', 'Bessemer Venture Partners', 'Corner Ventures', 'General Catalyst and Latitude', 'American Express', 'Salesforce', 'AmEx', 'Ilan Atias', 'Ziv Paz', 'CTO', 'COO', 'Intuit', 'QuickBooks', 'QuickBooks', 'Melio', 'PayPal', 'Venmo', 'Venmo', 'eBay', 'eBay’s', 'PayPal', 'Bill.com', 'Tipalti', 'SMBs', 'SMB', 'Bar', 'Melio', 'Melio', 'AmEx', 'Bar', 'Stripe', 'Melio', 'Melio', 'Melio', 'Michael Gilroy', 'Coatue', 'Bar', 'QuickBooks', 'Salesforce', 'SMB', 'Nike', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'SMBs', 'Lunden4:06', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/BcGv0Wq7vK,2021-01-14T19:54:58,5 consumer hardware VCs share their 2021 investment strategies,"['Consumer hardware has always been a tough market to crack, but the COVID-19 crisis made it even harder.TechCrunch surveyed five key investors who touch different aspects of the consumer electronics industry, based on our TechCrunch List of top VCs recommended by founders, along with other sources.We asked these investors the same six questions, and each provided similar thoughts, but different approaches:Hans Tung, managing partner, GGV CapitalDayna Grayson, co-founder and general partner, Construct CapitalCyril Ebersweiler, general partner, SOSVBilal Zuberi, partner, Lux CapitalRob Coneybeer, managing director, Shasta VenturesDespite the pandemic, each identified bright spots in the consumer electronic world. One thing is clear, investors are generally bullish on at-home fitness startups. Multiple respondents cited Peloton, Tonal and Mirror as recent highlights in consumer electronics.Said Shasta Venture’s Rob Coneybeer, “With all due respect to my friends at Nest (where Shasta was a Series A investor), Tonal is the most exciting consumer connected hardware company I’ve ever been involved with.”Besides asking about the trends and opportunities they’re pursuing in 2021, the investors we spoke to also identified other investors, founders and companies who are leaders in consumer hardware and shared how they’ve reshaped their investment strategies during the pandemic. Their responses have been edited for space and clarity.Hans Tung, GGV CapitalWhich consumer hardware sector shows the most promise for explosive growth?For consumer hardware, offering end users a differentiated experience is extremely important. Social interactions, gamification and high-quality PGC (professionally generated content) such as with Peloton, Xiaomi and Tonal is a must to drive growth. It’s also easy to see how the acceleration of the digital economy created by COVID-19 will also drive growth for hardware.First, services improved by the speed and reliability of 5G such as live streaming, gaming, cloud computing, etc. will create opportunity for new mobile devices and global mass market consumers will continue to demand high-quality, low-cost hardware. For example, Arevo is experimenting with “hardware as a service” with a 3D printing facility in Vietnam.For enterprise hardware, security, reliability and fast updates are key competitive advantages. Also as a result of 5G… manufacturing automation and industrial applications. Finally IoT for health and safety may find its sweet spot thanks to COVID-19 with new wearables that track sleep, fitness and overall wellness.How did COVID-19 change consumer hardware and your investment strategy?One opportunity for consumer hardware companies to consider as a result of COVID-19 is how they engage with their customers. They should think of themselves more like e-commerce companies, where user experience, ongoing engagement with the consumer and iteration based on market feedback rule the day. While Peloton had this approach well before COVID, it has built a $46 billion company thinking about their products in this way.For example, some consumers felt the bike was too expensive so instead of responding with a low-end product, the company partnered with Affirm to make their hardware more affordable with pay-as-you-go plans. A Peloton bike is not a one-and-done purchase; there is constant interaction between users, and the company that drives more satisfaction in the hardware adds more value in the business.Entering 2021, in what way is hardware still hard?Hardware is still hard because it takes more to iterate fast. The outcome for competitors relative to speed-to-market can be dramatic.

https://t.co/MQELZVGP4u,2021-01-25T14:37:16,Early-stage African VC firm Microtraction reports portfolio boom despite the weight of COVID-19,"['In a year marred by the coronavirus pandemic, it seems that early-stage startups on the African continent are continuing to see some notable growth, both in terms of their business and from investors looking to back them.\xa0Microtraction, an early-stage venture capital firm based in Lagos, Nigeria, saw funding nearly quadruple for its portfolio.In a review of the year published last week, the firm noted that 21 companies in its portfolio have raised more than $33 million in funding. This represents nearly four-fold growth over a year ago, when its portfolio raised $6 million (and just $3 million in 2018). The companies’ combined valuation stands at more than $147 million, according to the firm.Founded by Yele Bademosi in 2017, Microtraction arrived on the continent’s early-stage investment scene with all intent to be “the most accessible and preferred source of pre-seed funding for African tech entrepreneurs.”Bademosi, who returned to Nigeria from the U.K. in 2015, worked as the general manager for Starta Africa, an online community for African tech entrepreneurs. After his stint there, he saw the need to plug the gap of early-stage funding in Nigeria and the continent at large with Microtraction.Microtraction does not specify the size of its fund, but what is more clear is that\xa0it has attracted a great deal of attention and has built a strong network in part because of who backs it.\xa0Michael Seibel, the CEO of Y Combinator, is a global advisor and an investor in the firm, and so is Andy Volk, the head of ecosystem for Google Sub-Saharan Africa. Other investors include Pave Investments and U.S.-based angel investor Chris Schultz.Being entrepreneurs in the past, some of these investors know what it takes to build a startup in the U.S. But it’s completely different in Africa. With no on the ground knowledge as to which startups to fund but an interest to do so, for portfolio diversification and other personal reasons, Microtraction and a few other early-stage investors present the best bets to accomplish this goal.How fintech and serial founders drove African pre-seed investing to new heights in 2020At first, Microtraction’s standard deal was to offer portfolio startups $15,000 in exchange for a 7.5% equity. But as a sign of how the market is firming up, that changed last year, and now the firm invests $25,000 for 7% equity.Microtraction revealed that it accepted more than 500 applications from startups in Nigeria, Ghana, Zambia and Mauritius in its first full year of operation (though, just eight of those companies got investments).The introductory batch was all Nigerian: four fintech startups — Cowrywise, Riby, Wallets Africa\xa0and ThankUCash; a crypto-exchange startup, BuyCoins; a SaaS platform, Accounteer; an edtech startup, Schoolable; and healthtech startup, 54gene.2019 saw the local VC firm invest in six companies. This time there was a representative outside Nigeria — Ghanaian fintech startup Bitsika. The Nigerian startups included social commerce startup Sendbox; events startup Festival Coins; and communications-as-a-service platform Termii. The rest were unannounced.Half of its portfolio companies are backed by YC and other global acceleratorsLast year (the one this latest review covers), Microtraction announced seven startups. The latest selection includes Nigerian fintech startups Evolve Credit and Chaka; edtech startup Gradely; bus-hailing platform PlentyWaka; and Kenyan credit data marketplace CARMA.Of the total investments raised in 2019 and 2020, 54gene contributed more than half of those numbers by raising $4.5 million in seed and a $15 million Series A investment. With an ingenious solution to solve the underrepresentation of African genomics data in global genomics research, 54gene got accepted into the winter batch in January 2019, the same month it officially launched.Excluding 54gene, there were six other African-focused startups in the YC W19 batch. Two out of the six, Schoolable and Wallets Africa, were Microtraction portfolio companies. Others accepted into YC before and after include BuyCoins, Cowrywise, Termii and two unannounced startups.Microtraction-backed ThankUCash and a second unannounced startup have also joined cohorts at 500 Startups. On the other hand, Festival Coins is the only startup to be selected into Google for Startups Accelerator. With all accounted for, 11 out of the 21 startups are either backed by Y Combinator, 500 Startups or Google for Startups.The Microtraction team with founding partner, Yele Bademosi (far right). Image Credits: MicrotractionGetting into these global accelerators is a surefire way to receive follow-up investment, ranging from $125,000 to $150,000. From the outside in, startups see Microtraction and other early-stage VC firms like Ventures Platform as a means to that end. There have also been arguments that these firms build startups to be “YC or any global accelerator ready.”However, Dayo Koleowo, a partner at Microtraction alongside Chidinma Iwueke, debunks it saying there’s no formula behind the numbers we see. He believes YC and other accelerators share the same fundamentals with Microtraction, which revolves around the team, the market and traction.“We love super technical teams that understand the industry they are in and are likely to succeed without us. We are always looking for companies that are solving huge problems that a lot of people face,” he told TechCrunch. “Also, the tech and startup world moves fast, so we like teams who understand that and can show in real-time that they can execute. I believe that these global accelerators look for these same things.”Typically, YC and other accelerators may perform extended due diligence and risk assessments before cutting cheques for any African startup without a local backer. Koleowo points out that this might be why Microtraction portfolio companies get accepted quicker. “The icing on the cake is that there is a level of de-risking that has been done by Microtraction and other local investors on the ground before these global accelerators step in,” he added.These specialized Africa VC funds are welcoming co-investorsThat said, there’s no denying the significance of Microtraction’s advisory board in playing a part as to why half the firm’s portfolio are in global accelerators. Besides the names mentioned earlier, some of its past advisors included Lexi Novitske, former PIO at Singularity Investments; Dotun Olowoporoku, VC at Novastar Ventures; and Monique Woodward, ex-venture partner at 500 Startups.And with the growing trends of globalization, plus the acceptance of a more decentralised approach to building and operations in the tech industry because of COVID-19, it’s a trend that might continue for a while.']",a press release,"['African VC', 'NavigationClose', 'African VC', 'COVID-19Tage Kene-Okafor@ulonnaya', 'MicrotractionIn', 'Yele Bademosi', 'Starta Africa', 'Michael Seibel', 'Y Combinator', 'Andy Volk', 'Google Sub-Saharan Africa', 'Pave Investments', 'Chris Schultz', 'Riby, Wallets Africa', 'BuyCoins', 'VC', 'Sendbox', 'Festival Coins', 'Evolve Credit', 'Chaka', 'PlentyWaka', 'YC', 'Schoolable and Wallets Africa', 'BuyCoins', 'Cowrywise, Termii', 'Festival Coins', 'Google for Startups Accelerator', 'Y Combinator', 'Yele Bademosi', 'VC', 'Dayo Koleowo', 'Chidinma Iwueke', 'Koleowo', 'Microtraction’s', 'Lexi Novitske', 'Singularity Investments', 'Dotun Olowoporoku', 'VC', 'Novastar Ventures', 'Monique Woodward', 'COVID-19', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'African VC', 'COVID-19Tage Kene-Okafor3:37 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/2AfwoFyWfM,2021-01-25T14:07:52,Apple’s new Fitness+ feature brings celebrity-guided walks to your wrist,"['Here’s a bit of a curve ball from Apple. A month-and-a-half or so after launching the Fitness+ app premium workout service, the company’s offering up an add-on intended to offer an exercise dimension beyond the confines of iOS (and your living room). Arriving today for Fitness+ subscribers, Time to Walk is a new, guided walking tour hosted by a rotating cast of celebrity guests.It’s a pretty diverse cast, as evidenced by the first round of names, which are dropping via a software update today. Included in the first five are Dolly Parton — who is probably about as universally beloved a celebrity as exists in 2021 — and Warriors power forward Draymond Green, who is no doubt less universal, because, well, sports. Also included in the first round are musician Shawn Mendes and “Orange Is the New Black” star Uzo Aduba.Image Credits: AppleThere are five episodes up front, which will be available as activity cards on the Apple Watch Workout app. In fact, they should start showing as cards in the app’s feed shortly. Going forward, they’ll be updated at a pace of one a week.The experience is straightforward on the face of it. Essentially, Apple asks guests to record themselves on a walk, telling stories and sharing three songs. Music is played through the app and images are delivered to the small screen in an effort to build a semi-immersive (but not distracting) accompaniment for your own walk. You can save the songs on an Apple Music playlist or save the episode for later, if you want to listen again. For those who utilize wheelchairs for mobility, the feature will appear as “Time to Push,” which builds on top of the wheelchair-based fitness tracking Apple introduced several years back.An Apple Fitness+ subscription is required to follow along. That’s due, in part, to a deeper integration with the premium fitness service. Both are also tied directly into other Apple services, like Music, which the company has made a kind of foundational element of its workouts.I’ve always been a big walker — trying to avoid driving or public transit when time and distance allow. But the past year has really prioritized the activity for me as both an excuse to leave my one-bedroom apartment and a way to get in a workout with all of the gyms closed for months on end. It is, frankly, a pretty big factor in keeping me going throughout the pandemic.Image Credits: AppleWhen I walk, I do so with music or podcasts. I’ve tried some “walking meditations” in the past, but found that the experiences have revolved around notions of “quiet reflection,” which doesn’t quit do the trick when you’re walking over the 59th street bridge into midtown Manhattan. Time to Walk turns the idea on its head a bit, by approximating the experience of walking along with someone. As they walk, they relate a kind of stream-of-consciousness, relating often personal stories in the process. The idea, of course, being that walking is a head-clearing tool for many — creatives especially.“Walking is the most popular physical activity in the world, and one of the healthiest things we can do for our bodies. A walk can often be more than just exercise: It can help clear the mind, solve a problem, or welcome a new perspective,” Apple’s Jay Blahnik said in a release. “Even throughout this challenging period of time, one activity that has remained available to many is walking. With Time to Walk, we’re bringing weekly original content to Apple Watch in Fitness+ that includes some of the most diverse, fascinating, and celebrated guests offering inspiration and entertainment to help our users keep moving through the power of walking.”Like Fitness+ before it, the new feature is well-timed, as many parts of the world (the U.S. in particular) are still very much in the throes of pandemic-fueled shutdowns. It seems there’s a new story every day about a new potential mutation warning us off the sorts of things we used to do. Time to Walk is an effort to give you some interesting company for those walks.It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweat']",Apple apologizes for not telling customers iPhones with older batteries would slow over time,"['Apple', 'NavigationClose ScreenApple’s', 'AppleHere’s', 'Apple', 'Time', 'Draymond Green', 'Shawn Mendes', 'Uzo Aduba', 'the Apple Watch Workout', 'Apple', 'Apple Music', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Walk', 'Apple’s', 'Jay Blahnik', 'Apple Watch', 'Walk', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Watchfitnessfitness plusApple’s', 'Apple', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/NlRj40UcXt,2021-01-25T14:01:52,"Moderna says it’s making variant-specific COVID-19 vaccines, but its existing vaccine should still work","['Moderna has detailed some of the steps it’s taking to ensure that its vaccine remains effective in the face of emerging strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that leads to COVID-19. These include testing how adding a second booster, for a total of three shots, works with its existing COVID-19 vaccine, and also developing a strain-specific variant designed to target spike proteins on the new variants of the virus that were first identified in the U.K. and in South Africa.The company is pursuing these measures “out of an abundance of caution,” the biotech firm said in a press release, since early studies show that the existing vaccine continues to prove effective against these new strains, albeit with some loss of efficacy specifically with the B.1.351 variant, which was first identified in patients in South Africa. Even so, it’s heartening to see the company moving quickly to address the virus’ mutation, since it’s likely that similar adaptations will be required longer term to keep COVID-19 in control even once the current pandemic is ended.Further, Moderna says that in fact, it expects both its forthcoming candidate and its existing booster vaccine should be able to provide additional immunity-boosting capabilities when used in combination with “all of the leading vaccine candidates” on the market. That means the company believes it could be used in combination with the Oxford or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to boost immunity, which could be helpful in cases where supplies of one or the other are low and there’s an urgent need to provide a booster in a timely manner.The best news of all of this is, of course, that Moderna now has evidence that suggests the mRNA-based vaccine it’s already providing to people globally will still provide protection against SARS-CoV-2, and by extension, COVID-19. Specifically for the U.K. variant in particular, the study data shows no reduction in immune performance in patients who received the vaccine. As for the South African variant, that reduction in efficacy mostly translates to a potential of quicker waning of immunity provided by the jab — which hopefully just means people will need another jab sooner than expected, but shouldn’t lead to any dramatic changes in our combined global approach to providing inoculations, especially initially.Moderna is developing three new mRNA-based vaccines for seasonal flu, HIV and Nipah virus']",Yac,"['Moderna', 'NavigationClose ScreenModerna', 'Etherington@etherington', 'MICA', 'Getty ImagesModerna', 'Moderna', 'Oxford', 'Pfizer', 'COVID-19', 'Moderna', 'Nipah', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'AfricaModerna', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

It later apologized.Apple apologizes for not telling customers iPhones with older batteries would slow over timeThe class action suit in Italy is seeking €60 million in compensation — based on at least €60 in average compensation per iPhone owner. Affected devices named in the suit are the iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus, per a press release put out by the umbrella consumer organization Euroconsumers, which counts Altroconsumo as a member.The suit is the third to be filed in the region over the issue — following suits filed in Belgium and Spain last month.A fourth — in Portugal — is slated to be filed shortly.The tech giant settled similar charges in the U.S. last year — where it was accused of intentionally slowing down the performance of older iPhones to encourage customers to buy newer models or fresh batteries — shelling out $500 million, or around $25 per phone, to settle that case (while denying any wrongdoing).“When consumers buy Apple iPhones, they expect sustainable quality products. Unfortunately, that is not what happened with the iPhone 6 series. Not only were consumers defrauded, and did they have to face frustration and financial harm, from an environmental point of view it is also utterly irresponsible,” said Els Bruggeman, Euroconsumers’ head of policy and enforcement, in a statement.“This new lawsuit is the latest front in our fight against planned obsolescence in Europe. Our ask is simple: American consumers received compensation, European consumers want to be treated with the same fairness and respect.”Euroconsumers has produced a video (embedded below) to drum up wider support for the class actions in which it satirizes Apple’s “genius” in coming up with clever ways to accelerate its products’ end of life…Apple has been contacted for comment on the European class actions.Almost a year ago the company was fined €25 million by France’s competition watchdog over an iOS update that capped performance of aging devices.

https://t.co/wU2wqzby40,2021-01-25T12:23:45,TikTok has until Friday to respond to Italy’s order to block users it can’t age-verify after girl’s death,"['TikTok has until Friday to respond to an order by Italy’s data protection agency to block users whose age it cannot verify, TechCrunch has learned.The GPDP made an “immediate” order Friday in response to the death of a 10-year-old girl from Palermo who died of asphyxiation after participating in a “blackout challenge” on the social network, according to reports in local media.The agency said the ban would remain in place until February 15 — suggesting it would make another assessment about any additional action at that point.At the time of writing it does not appear that TikTok has taken action to comply with the GPDP’s order.A spokeswoman told us it is reviewing the notification. “We have received and are currently reviewing the notification from Garante,” she said. “Privacy and safety are top priorities for TikTok and we are constantly strengthening our policies, processes and technologies to protect all users, and our younger users in particular.”The GPDP had already raised concerns about children’s privacy on TikTok, warning in December that its age verification checks are easily circumvented and raising objections over default settings that make users’ content public. On December 22 it also announced it had opened a formal procedure — giving TikTok 30 days to respond.The order to block users whose age it cannot verify is in addition to that action. If TikTok does not comply with the GPDP’s administrative order it could face enforcement from the Italian agency, drawing on penalty powers set out in the GDPR.TikTok’s spokeswoman declined to answer additional questions about the order — which prohibits it from further processing user data “for whom there is no absolute certainty of age”, per GPDP’s press release Friday.France fines Google $120M and Amazon $42M for dropping tracking cookies without consentThe company also did not respond when we asked if it had submitted a response to the agency’s formal procedure.In a statement last week following the girl’s death the company said: “Our deepest sympathies are with the girl’s family and friends. At TikTok, the safety of our community — in particular our younger users — is our priority, and we do not allow content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies dangerous behaviour that might lead to injury. We offer robust safety controls and resources for teens and families on our platform, and we regularly evolve our policies and protections in our ongoing commitment to our community.”TikTok has said it has found no evidence of any challenge involving asphyxiation on its platform.Although, in recent years, there have been a number of previous reports of underage users hanging themselves (or attempting to) after trying to copy things they saw on the platform.Users frequently create and respond to content challenges, as part of TikTok’s viral appeal — such as (recently) a trend for singing sea shanties.At the time of writing, a search on the platform for ‘#blackoutchallenge’ returns no user content but displays a warning that the phrase “may be associated with behavior or content that violates our guidelines”.Screengrab of the warning users see if they search for ‘blackout challenge’ (Image credit: TechCrunch)There have been TikTok challenges related to “hanging” (as in people hanging by parts of their body other than their neck from/off objects) — and a search for #hangingchallenge does still return results (including some users discussing the death of the 10-year-old girl).Last year a number of users also participated in an event on the platform in which they posted images of black squares — using the hashtag #BlackOutTuesday — which related to Black Lives Matters protests.So the term “blackout” has similarly been used on TikTok in relation to encouraging others to post content. Though not in that case in relation to asphyxiation.French court slaps down Google’s appeal against $57M GDPR fineIreland’s Data Protection Commission, which has been lined up as TikTok’s lead data supervisor in Europe — following the company’s announcement last year that its Irish entity would take over legal responsibility for processing European users’ data — does not have an open inquiry into the platform “at present”, per a spokesman.But TikTok is already facing a number of other investigations and legal challenges in Europe, including an investigation into how the app handles users’ data by France’s watchdog CNIL — announced last summer.In recent years, France’s CNIL has been responsible for handing out some of the largest penalties for tech giants for infringing EU data protection laws (including fines for Google and Amazon).In December, it also emerged that a 12-year-old girl in the U.K. is bringing a legal challenge against TikTok — claiming it uses children’s data unlawfully. A court ruled she can remain anonymous if the case goes ahead.Last month Ireland’s data protection regulator put out draft guidelines on what it couched as “the Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data Processing” — with the stated aim of driving improvements in standards of data processing related to minors.While the GDPR typically requires data protection complaints to be funnelled through a lead agency, under the one-stop-shop mechanism, Italy’s GPDP’s order to TikTok to cease processing is possible under powers set out in the regulation (Article 66) that allows for “urgency procedures” to be undertaken by national watchdogs in instances of imperative risk. Although any such provisional measures can only last for three months — and only applies in the country where the DPA has jurisdiction (Italy in this case).Ireland’s DPC would be the EU agency responsible for leading any resulting investigation.“If TikTok does not comply with our order, the sanctions provided for in the GDPR are applicable,” a spokesperson for the Italian agency confirmed.TikTok is being investigated by France’s data watchdog\nThis report was updated with comment from the GDPD']",Taboola,"['TikTok', 'NavigationClose', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Jakub Porzycki', 'NurPhoto / Getty ImagesTikTok', 'GPDP', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'GPDP', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'GPDP', 'Google', 'Amazon $42M', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'Black Lives Matters', 'TikTok', 'Google’s', 'Data Protection Commission', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'France’s', 'EU', 'Google', 'TikTok', 'Ireland’s', 'TikTok', 'DPA', 'EU', 'TikTok', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropePrivacychildren', 'regulationprivacytiktokTikTok', 'GPDP', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/ly34cPF4xx,2021-01-25T12:04:55,Wolt closes $530M round to continue expanding beyond restaurant delivery,"['Wolt, the Helsinki-based online ordering and delivery company that initially focused on restaurants but has since expanded to other verticals, has raised $530 million in new funding. The round was led by Iconiq Growth, with participation from Tiger Global, DST, KKR, Prosus, EQT Growth and Coatue.Previous backers 83North, Highland Europe, Goldman Sachs Growth Equity, EQT Ventures and Vintage Investment Partners also followed on. The new round takes the total amount of financing Wolt has raised to $856 million. Wolt declined to disclose the company’s latest valuation, although we know from the previous D round that the company is one of Europe’s so-called unicorns.“We operate in an extremely competitive and well-funded industry, and this round allows us to have a long-term mindset when it comes to doubling down on our different markets,” says co-founder and CEO Miki Kuusi in a statement. “Despite the turbulence of 2020, we’ve remained focused on growth, tripling our revenue to a preliminary $330 million against a net loss of just $38 million. Compared to the $670 million in new capital that we’ve raised during this year, this puts us into a strong position for investing in our people, technology, and markets when thinking about the next few years ahead”.Former Atomico and SoftBank VC Carolina Brochado has joined EQT to help build its new growth fundSince launching with 10 restaurants in its home city in 2015, five years on Wolt has expanded to 23 countries and 120 cities, mostly in Europe but also including Japan and Israel. More recently, like others in the restaurant delivery space, Wolt has expanded beyond restaurants and takeout food into the grocery and retail sectors. This, says the company, sees it offer anything from cosmetics to pet food and pharmaceuticals on its platform.“This was mostly a primary raise,” Kuusi tells me when I ask if the new round includes secondary funding (i.e. shareholders that exited to new investors). “We’re not looking to disclose the valuation at this time, but we’ve previously shared that the Series D round that we raised in early 2020 valued the company at above €1 billion,” he adds.Kuusi says that the latest funding round is based on the belief that local services in the offline world will gradually be brought online by players “that can execute and maintain a great customer experience”. “We started with an exclusive focus on the restaurant, as it’s the biggest local service with an underlying high-frequency use case,” he says. “We quickly learnt that the magical product market fit for bringing the restaurant online was to offer a quick and predictable delivery experience from restaurants that didn’t use to be available for delivery. We do this by handling the complexity of the delivery on the restaurant’s behalf”.However, this was especially difficult to do efficiently and sustainably in a small and difficult home market in the Nordics. To solve this, Wolt needed to build an “optimization-heavy logistics setup for last-mile delivery” that Kuusi says lets the service operate even in “very small cities with low income disparity, limited population density and high labor costs”.“This means that we can operate efficiently even with relatively low order volumes, enabling us to grow and expand rapidly with much less financing than some of the other players in the market. We simply had no other choice than to do it this way as we came from such a difficult home market”.On this foundation, Wolt is expanding into other ordering and local delivery verticals, aiming to be what Kuusi dubs as “the everything app” of goods and services. “Today, Wolt is much more than a restaurant delivery service; you can order groceries, electronics, flowers, clothes and many other things on our platform,” he explains. “We believe that the future of how people buy Nike shoes is a few taps on Wolt and some 30 minutes later you get any pair of shoes brought to your door. This is what we strive to make into a reality with our team at Wolt”. (I’m an Adidas guy myself, steadfastly European.)Asked what he thinks about all the money being pumped into the dark convenience store model, Kuusi says Wolt is investing into its own dark store operation called Wolt Market. “It’s not surprising to also see a growing amount of financing going into this sector”, he admits. “We’re huge believers in a hybrid model where there will be both offline/online retailers as well as focused online retailers in the mix. Obviously the latter category is only getting started, and we should see a massive amount of growth for the coming years ahead”.Gorillas, the on-demand grocery delivery startup taking Berlin by storm, has raised $44M Series A\xa0']",said today,"['NavigationClose', 'WoltWolt', 'Helsinki', 'Iconiq Growth', 'Tiger Global', 'DST', 'KKR', 'Goldman Sachs Growth Equity', 'EQT Ventures', 'Vintage Investment Partners', 'Wolt', 'Miki Kuusi', '’ve', 'Atomico', 'SoftBank', '’ve', 'Kuusi', 'Nordics', 'Wolt', 'Kuusi', 'Wolt', 'Kuusi', 'Wolt', 'Nike', 'Kuusi', 'Wolt', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropeFundings & ExitsRecent FundingStartupsTCdsteqt', 'Helsinki', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/8XClinfr15,2021-01-25T12:00:31,Taboola is going public via SPAC,"['Taboola is the latest company seeking to go public via special purpose acquisition company — more commonly known as a SPAC.To achieve this, it will merge with ION Acquisition Corp., which went public in 2020 with the aim of funding an Israeli tech acquisition (Haaretz reported last month that Taboola was in talks with ION). The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, and the combined company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol TBLA.Founded in 2007, Taboola powers content recommendation widgets (and advertising on those widgets) across 9,000 websites for publishers including CNBC, NBC News, Business Insider, The Independent and El Mundo. It says it reaches 516 million daily active users while working with more than 13,000 advertisers.The company had previously planned to merge with competitor Outbrain before the deal was canceled last fall, with sources pointing to the market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a “challenging culture fit” and regulatory issues to explain the deal’s end.Taboola’s founder and CEO Adam Singolda (pictured above, left) told me that this didn’t lead directly to the SPAC deal. But he said, “I always wanted to go public,” which wasn’t possible while the merger was in the works. Once that deal was called off, and with 2020 turning out to be a strong year for Taboola — it’s projecting revenue of $1.2 billion, including $375 million ex-TAC revenue (revenue after paying publishers), with over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA — the time seemed right, and ION seemed like the right partner.Taboola and Outbrain call off their $850M merger“We believe Taboola is an open web recommendation leader which is well positioned to challenge the walled gardens,” said ION CEO Gilad Shany in a statement. “We were looking to merge with a global technology leader with Israeli DNA and we found that in Taboola. The combination of long-term partnerships built by the company with thousands of open web digital properties, their direct access to advertisers, massive global reach and proven AI technology, allows Taboola to provide significant value to their partners while also achieving attractive unit economics as the company grows.”The deal will value Taboola at $2.6 billion. Through this transaction, the company plans to raise a total of $545 million, including $285 million in PIPE financing secured from Fidelity Management & Research Company, Baron Capital Group, funds and accounts managed by Hedosophia, the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds and others.Singolda said that the company plans to invest $100 million in R&D this year, and that he hopes to expand the technology into areas like e-commerce and TV advertising, with the goal of moving “beyond the browser.” More broadly, he said he wants Taboola to be “a strong public company that champions the open web.”“The open web is a $64 billion advertising market [according to Taboola estimates], but there’s no Google for the open web,” he said.Yes, Google itself spends plenty of time talking about similar ideas, but Singolda argued that while Google has consumer products like search and YouTube that compete with other publishers for time and attention, “Taboola is not in the consumer business … We serve our partners, and it’s in our identity to drive audience growth, engagement and revenue.”Almost everything you need to know about SPACs']",Sano Genetics,"['NavigationClose', 'ION Acquisition Corp.', 'Haaretz', 'ION', 'the New York Stock Exchange', 'Taboola', 'CNBC', 'NBC News', 'Business Insider', 'Independent', 'El Mundo', 'Outbrain', 'Taboola’s', 'Adam Singolda', 'TAC', 'ION', 'Taboola', 'ION', 'Gilad Shany', 'AI', 'Taboola', 'Taboola', 'PIPE', 'Fidelity Management & Research Company', 'Capital Group', 'the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds', 'Singolda', 'Taboola', 'Singolda', 'Google', 'YouTube', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', '& ExitsMediaStartupsION Acquisition Corp.', 'ION Acquisition Corp.', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/uTaKW3Oq8J,2021-01-25T10:00:55,"Sano Genetics, a startup helping with Long COVID research, raises £2.5M in seed funding","['Sano Genetics, a startup with a broad mission to support personalised medicine research by increasing participation in clinical trials, has raised £2.5 million in seed funding.The round is led by Episode1 Ventures, alongside Seedcamp, Cambridge Enterprise, January Ventures and several Europe and U.S.-based angel investors. It adds to £500,000 in pre-seed funding from 2018.Sano Genetics says part of the new capital will be to fund free at-home DNA testing kits for 3,000 people affected by Long COVID. It will also further invest in the development of its tech platform and grow the team.Founded in 2017 by Charlotte Guzzo, Patrick Short and William Jones after they met at Cambridge University while studying genomics as postgrads, Sano Genetics has built what it describes as a “private-by-design” tech platform to help patients take part in medical research and clinical trials. This includes at-home genetic testing capabilities, and is seeing the company support research into multiple sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, NAFLD and ulcerative colitis2, with a research programme for Parkinson’s disease on the agenda for later in 2021.“For participants in medical research, the process is not user friendly,” says Sano Genetics CEO Patrick Short. “There is usually little to no benefit for participants beyond altruism, taking part is difficult and time-consuming and people are also concerned about the privacy of their sensitive genetic and medical information.“[Therefore], for researchers in biotech, pharma and academia, it is very difficult to attract and retain research participants, which adds substantial costs and time to their research. In particular for research involving genetics and precision therapies, it is doubly challenging to find the ‘right’ patients because genetic testing is not routine in the healthcare system”.To help solve this, Sano Genetics matches relevant participants to research via its platform. It then makes participation easier by enabling at-home genetic testing and by guiding participants through the process.“The system is designed so users know exactly what will happen with their data, and we give them straightforward ways to control their data,” explains Short. “We keep our users engaged and involved in the research process by giving them updates on the research they have been a part of, and with free personalised content including genetic reports, and stories from other people like them on our blog”.A typical end user is someone who has a chronic or rare disease and is using the platform to take part in research that helps them personally (e.g. access to a new therapy via a clinical trial) or to help others like them.Meanwhile, Sano Genetics generates revenue by charging biotech and pharma companies fees to find the right patients for their studies. “The typical study for us consists of a set-up fee, a per-test fee for our at-home genetic testing and analysis, and a fee for each referral we make of an interested and eligible participant to their research study,” adds the Sano Genetics CEO.Moderna is developing three new mRNA-based vaccines for seasonal flu, HIV and Nipah virus']",Pula,"['Sano Genetics', 'NavigationClose', 'Sano GeneticsSano Genetics', 'Episode1 Ventures', 'Cambridge Enterprise', 'January Ventures', 'Genetics', 'Charlotte Guzzo', 'Patrick Short', 'William Jones', 'Cambridge University', 'Sano Genetics', 'NAFLD', 'Sano Genetics', 'Patrick Short', 'Sano Genetics', 'Sano Genetics', 'the Sano Genetics CEO.Moderna', 'Nipah', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkCopy Share', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsBiotechEuropeFundings & ExitsHealthRecent FundingStartupsTCCambridge', 'Genetics', 'Genetics', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

NetEase, the second-largest gaming company in China (behind Tencent), is among a group of investors who just backed IMVU, an avatar-focused social network operating out of California.Menlo Park-based Structural Capital among other institutions that also joined in the strategic round totaling $35 million. IMVU has raised more than $77 million from five rounds since it was co-founded by “The Lean Startup” author Eric Ries back in 2004. The company declined to disclose its post-money valuation.The fresh investment will be used to fund IMVU’s product development and comes fresh off a restructuring at the company. A new parent organization called Together Labs was formed to oversee its flagship platform IMVU, in which users can create virtual rooms and chat with strangers using custom avatars, a product that’s today considered by some a dating platform; a new service called Vcoin, which lets users buy, gift, earn and convert a digital asset from the IMVU platform into fiat; and other virtual services.“NetEase operates some of the most successful, biggest in scale, and evergreen MMO [massively multiplayer online] games in China and they see in IMVU business highlights echoing theirs,” Daren Tsui, chief executive officer at Together Labs, told TechCrunch.“IMVU operates one of the world’s oldest, yet most vibrant and young — in terms of our user base — metaverses. We have many shared business philosophies and complementary know-how. It is a natural fit for us to become partners,” he added.Founded in 2005, NetEase is now known for its news portal, music streaming app, education products and video games that compete with those of Tencent. It has over the years made a handful of minority investments in companies outside China, though it’s not nearly as aggressive as Tencent in terms of investment pace and volume.A NetEase spokesperson declined to comment on the investment in IMVU.The partnership, according to Tsui, would allow the virtual networking company to tap NetEase’s game development and engineering capabilities as well as leverage NetEase’s knowledge in global market strategy as Together Labs launches future products, including one called WithMe.In 2020, IMVU saw record growth, with over 7 million monthly active users and 400,000 products created every month by IMVU users. The service currently has a footprint in more than 140 countries and is “always looking to expand” in existing markets, including Asia, in which it already has a localized Korean app, according to Tsui.“With IMVU’s accelerating growth over recent years, the launch of VCOIN, and the development of the new WithMe platform, we felt timing was right to bring all of these products under a new roof to reinforce our commitment for creating authentic human connections in virtual spaces,” said the chief executive.Why social networks want even more gaming']",Alma,"['IMVU', 'NetEase', 'NavigationClose', 'IMVU', 'NetEase', 'NetEase', 'Tencent', 'IMVU', 'Structural Capital', 'Eric Ries', 'IMVU’s', 'Together Labs', 'Vcoin', 'Daren Tsui', 'Together Labs', 'NetEase', 'NetEase', 'Tsui', 'NetEase', 'NetEase', 'Together Labs', 'Tsui', 'IMVU’s', 'VCOIN', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'IMVU', 'NetEase', 'Liao11:00 AM', 'NetEase', 'Tencent', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/24VMWBJm8G,2021-01-25T09:00:03,Kenyan insurtech startup Pula raises $6M Series A to derisk smallholder farmers across Africa,"['Pula, a Kenyan insurtech startup that specialises in digital and agricultural insurance to derisk millions of smallholder farmers across Africa, has closed a Series A investment of $6 million.The round was led by Pan-African early-stage venture capital firm,\xa0TLcom Capital, with participation from nonprofit Women’s World Banking. The raise comes after Pula closed $1 million in seed investment from Rocher Participations with support from Accion Venture Lab, Omidyar Network and several angel investors in 2018.\xa0\xa0Founded by Rose Goslinga and Thomas Njeru in 2015, Pula delivers agricultural insurance and digital products to help smallholder farmers navigate climate risks, improve their farming practices and bolster their incomes over time.Agriculture insurance has traditionally relied on farm business. In the U.S. or Europe with typically large farms, an average insurance premium is $1,000. But in Africa, where smallholding or small-scale farms are the norm, the number stands at an average of $4.It is particularly telling that the value of agricultural insurance premiums in Africa represents less than 1% of the world’s total when the continent has 17% of the world’s arable land.\xa0This disparity stems from the fact that the traditional method of calculating insurance through farm visits is often unaffordable for these smallholder farmers. Thus, they are often neglected from financial protection against climate risks like flood, drought, pestilence and hail.Pula is solving this problem by using technology and data. Through its Area Yield Index Insurance product, the insurtech startup leverages machine learning, crop-cut experiments and data points relating to weather patterns and farmer losses, to build products that cater to various risks.But getting farmers on board has never been easy, Goslinga told TechCrunch. According to her, Pula has understood not to sell insurance directly to small-scale farmers, because they can suffer from optimism bias. “Some think a climate disaster wouldn’t hit their farms for a particular season; hence, they don’t ask for insurance initially. But if they witness any of these climate risks during the season, they would want to get insurance, which is counterproductive to Pula,” said the founder in a phone call.Image Credits: PulaSo the startup instead partners with banks. Banks provide loans to farmers and make it compulsory for them to have insurance. With the loan, banks can pay the insurance on behalf of the farmers at the start of the season. But at the end of the season, the farmer has to repay the loan with interest.“The unit economics doesn’t work for us to work with farmers directly. But with banks, we know they provide loans to farmers with much better margins to pay for insurance. Also, we work together with government subsidy programs since they’re also interested in protecting their farmers.”Through its partnerships with banks, governments and agricultural input companies, Pula is at the center of an ecosystem that provides insurance to smallholder farmers and has amassed 50 insurance partners and six reinsurance partners.\xa0Its clientele includes the likes of the World Food Programme and Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the Zambian and Kenyan governments. Social enterprises like One Acre Fund, startups like Apollo Agriculture and agribusiness giants like Flour Mills and Export Trading Group are also among Pula’s clients.Co-CEOs with agricultural backgroundsWhen Goslinga met Njeru in 2008, she worked for Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture (SFSA). There, she started Kilimo Salama as a micro-insurance program for more than 200,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda. She met Njeru, who was the lead actuary at UAP Insurance, a partner to the Kilimo Salama program, at the time.After staying with Syngenta for six years and recognising the need to provide standard insurance products for smallholder farmers, Goslinga left to start Pula with Njeru in 2015. However, it wasn’t until two years later that Njeru joined fulltime as he had a six-year engagement with Deloitte South Africa from 2012 as a consultant actuary. The pair both act as co-CEOs.“When Thomas and I launched Pula in 2015, we had one goal in mind: to build and deliver scalable insurance solutions for Africa’s 700 million smallholder farmers,” Goslinga said. “With our latest funding, now is the time to break into new ground. In our five years since launching, we’ve built strong traction for our products. However, the fact remains that across Africa and other emerging markets, there are still millions of smallholder farmers with risks to their livelihoods that have not been covered.”According to Goslinga, the COVID-19 pandemic helped Pula double its footprint and size as rural farming activities and operations continued despite pandemic-induced lockdowns.\xa0Pula co-founders and Co-CEOs (Rose Goslinga and Thomas Njeru)Therefore, the new financing will scale up operations in its existing 13 markets across Africa, where it has insured over 4.3 million farmers. They include Senegal, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique. Likewise, the Kenyan startup hopes to propel its expansion for smallholder farmers in Asia and Latin America.Pula is one of the few African startups disrupting the farming industry with technology. Its Series A investment attests that investors’ appetite for agritech startups is still on the rise.A week ago, Aerobotics, a South African startup that uses artificial intelligence to help farmers protect their trees and fruits from risks, raised a Series B round of $17 million. Last month, SunCulture, a Kenyan startup that provides solar power systems, water pumps and irrigation systems for small-scale farmers, raised $14 million.\xa0South African startup Aerobotics raises $17M to scale its AI-for-agriculture platformAnother startup is Apollo Agriculture which raised $6 million Series A, akin to Pula. Not only did the pair raise the same round, Apollo Agriculture and Pula both deal with providing financial resources to smallholder farmers.

The company has been building a new payment option for expensive goods. You can choose to pay over three or four installments. This product sounds familiar if you’ve used Klarna in the past. But Klarna isn’t available in France.Cathay Innovation, Idinvest, Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund, Seaya Ventures and Picus Capital are participating in today’s funding round. In addition to today’s equity round, Alma is raising a credit line of $25.5 million (€21 million) to finance merchant payments.What makes Alma attractive to merchants is that the startup is handling 100% of the risk involved with a payment over multiple installments. When a customer buys a bike over four installments, they’ll get charged over several months. But the merchant gets paid on day one.Since I first covered Alma, the startup has launched the ability to pay later. You enter your card information right now but you get charged 15 days or a month later. It can be particularly useful if you’re unsure about something you’re buying and if you think there’s a chance you’ll send it back.And it’s an attractive option in France where debit cards are the norm — not credit cards. Alma also plans to offer longer plans, such as the ability to buy now and pay over 6, 10 or 12 installments.Thanks to the new influx of cash, the startup plans to triple the size of its team and reach €1 billion in annual payment volume within two years.

SpiderSilk helps its customers understand their attack surface by looking for things that are exposed but shouldn’t be.The cybersecurity startup uses its scanner to map out a company’s assets and attack surfaces to detect vulnerabilities and data exposures, and it also simulates cyberattacks to help customers understand where vulnerabilities are in their defenses.“The attack surface management and threat detection platform we built scans the open internet on a continuous basis in order to attribute all publicly accessible assets back to organizations that could be affected by them, either directly or indirectly,” SpiderSilk’s co-founder and chief executive Rami El Malak told TechCrunch. “As a result, the platform regularly uncovers exploits and highlights how no organization is immune from infrastructure visibility blind spots.”El Malak said the funding will help to build out its security, engineering and data science teams, as well as its marketing and sales. He said the company is expanding its presence to North America with sales and engineering teams.It’s the company’s second round of funding, after a seed round of $500,000 in November 2019, also led by Global Ventures and several angel investors.“The SpiderSilk team are outstanding partners, solving a critical problem in the ever-complex world of cybersecurity, and protecting companies online from the increasing threats of malicious activity,” said Basil Moftah, general partner at Global Ventures.MoviePass exposed thousands of unencrypted customer card numbers']",Wingcopter,"['SpiderSilk', 'SpiderSilk', 'Olemedia', 'Getty ImagesDubai', 'SpiderSilk', 'Global Ventures', 'SpiderSilk', 'Samsung', 'Clearview AI', 'SpiderSilk', 'Mossab Hussein', 'SpiderSilk', 'SpiderSilk', 'Rami El Malak', 'Malak', 'Global Ventures', 'SpiderSilk', 'Basil Moftah', 'Global Ventures', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'InternetCybersecurity', 'SpiderSilk', 'SpiderSilk', 'Global Ventures', 'STV', 'SpiderSilk', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/CgGLTxmGjY,2021-01-25T03:46:14,Autonomous driving startup Uisee attracts Chinese state investor in $150M round,"['There is no lack of state funding for China’s smart-driving startups nowadays as the country advances its goal to become a global leader in artificial intelligence in a decade’s time. The latest to get a financial boost is Uisee, a Beijing-based company founded by a group of tech veterans including the former head of Intel Labs China, Wu Gansha.Uisee said Monday it has closed a funding round north of 1 billion yuan ($150 million) from investors including the National Manufacturing Transformation and Upgrade Fund, a $21 billion state-backed fund set up in 2019 to promote and upgrade the manufacturing value chain in China, with the Ministry of Finance as the biggest shareholder.Five-year-old Uisee is the first autonomous driving company the fund has ever backed, according to the announcement, and the firm is expected to help propel forward the public transit and logistics sectors and become a “benchmark” autonomous driving enterprise in China, said a manager from the fund in a statement.Unlike Mobileye or China’s Momenta, which sell advanced driver-assistance systems as they invest in the development of more advanced Level 4 driving, Uisee leapfrogs ADAS and focuses on unmanned driving, co-founder and CEO Wu Gansha said in a previous interview.Uisee supplies technology for cases ranging from robotaxis and city buses to airports and logistics hubs. It’s secured a handful of major customers, including the Hong Kong International Airport, which is using Uisee’s solutions to automate its baggage tractors, alongside state-backed automakers FAW Group, Dongfeng Motor and more.The new financial injection, which also counts a number of undisclosed “industrial investors,” will allow Uisee to ramp up research and development and promote the industry’s at-scale monetization. The company claims that the joint venture between SAIC Motor, General Motors and Liuzhou Wuling Motors has used its technology to enable 300,000 kilometers of vehicle operation without safety drivers inside a logistics hub.Existing investors include Bosch the German electronics giant, which participated in Uisee’s Series B round last year, alongside Shenzhen government-backed Shenzhen Capital Group and state-backed CCI Investment.Several other Chinese startups have also received sizable fundings in recent months to accelerate their smart-driving solutions such as WeRide, which closed its Series B of $310 million at the start of 2021; chipmaker Horizon Robotics, which landed $150 million in December;\xa0Pony.ai, which pocked $267 million in November; and ride-hailing platform Didi, which from last May raised $500 million for its new entity dedicated to autonomous driving.Horizon Robotics, a Chinese rival to Nvidia, seeks to raise over $700M']",told the investigating magistrate,"['NavigationClose ScreenAutonomous', 'UiseeThere', 'Intel Labs China', 'Wu Gansha', 'the National Manufacturing Transformation and Upgrade Fund', 'the Ministry of Finance', 'Mobileye', 'ADAS', 'Wu Gansha', 'the Hong Kong International Airport', 'FAW Group', 'Dongfeng Motor', 'SAIC Motor', 'General Motors', 'Liuzhou Wuling Motors', 'Shenzhen Capital Group', 'CCI Investment', 'WeRide', 'Horizon Robotics', 'Didi', 'Horizon Robotics', 'Nvidia', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Njj6YdFy9r,2021-01-24T22:02:39,Wingcopter raises $22 million to expand to the US and launch a next-generation drone,"['German drone technology startup Wingcopter has raised a $22 million Series A – its first significant venture capital raise after mostly bootstrapping. The company, which focuses on drone delivery, has come a long way since its founding in 2017, having developed, built and flown its Wingcopter 178 heavy-lift cargo delivery drone using its proprietary and patented tilt-rotor propellant mechanism, which combines all the benefits of vertical take-off and landing with the advantages of fixed-wing aircraft for longer-distance horizontal flight.This new Series A round was led by Silicon Valley VC Xplorer Capital, as well as German growth fund Futury Regio Growth. Wingcopter CEO and founder Tom Plümmer explained in an interview that the addition of an SV-based investor is particularly important to the startup, since it’s in the process of preparing its entry into the U.S., with plans for an American facility, both for flight testing to satisfy FAA requirements for operational certification, as well as eventually for U.S.-based drone production.Wingcopter has already been operating commercially in a few different markets globally, including in Vanuatu in partnership with Unicef for vaccine delivery to remote areas, in Tanzania for two-way medical supply delivery and in Ireland where it completed the world’s first delivery of insulin by drone beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS), the industry’s technical term for when a drone flies beyond the visual range of a human operator who has the ability to take control in case of emergencies.Wingcopter CEO and co-founder Tom Plümmer. Image Credits: Jonas WreschWhile Wingcopter has so far pursued a business as an OEM manufacturer of drones and has had paying customers eager to purchase its hardware effectively since day one (Plümmer told me that they had at least one customer wiring them money before they even had a bank account set up for the business), but it’s also now getting into the business of offering drone delivery as a service. After doing the hard work of building its technology from the ground up and seeking out the necessary regulatory approvals to operate in multiple markets around the world, Plümmer says that he and his co-founders realized that operating a service business not only meant a new source of revenue, but also better served the needs of many of its potential customers.“We learned during this process, through applying for permission, receiving these permissions and working now in five continents in multiple countries, flying BVLOS, that actually operating drones is something we are now very good at,” he said. This was actually becoming a really good source of income and ended up actually making up more than half of our revenue at some point. Also looking at scalability of the business model of being an OEM, it’s kind of [ … ] linear.”UPS partners with Wingcopter to develop new multipurpose drone delivery fleetLinear growth with solid revenue and steady demand was fine for Wingcopter as a bootstrapped startup founded by university students supported by a small initial investment from family and friends. But Plümmer says the company saw so much potential in the technology it had developed and the emerging drone delivery market, that the exponential growth curve of its drone-delivery-as-a-service model helped make traditional VC backing make sense. In the early days, Plümmer says Wingcopter had been approached by VCs, but at the time it didn’t make sense for what they were trying to do; that’s changed.“We were really lucky to bootstrap over the last four years,” Plümmer said. “Basically, just by selling drones and creating revenue, we could employ our first 30 employees. But at some point, you realize you want to really plan with that revenue, so you want to have monthly revenues, which generally repeat like a software business — like software as a service.”Wingcopter 178 cargo drone performing a delivery for Merck. Image Credits: WingcopterWingcopter has also established a useful hedge regarding its service business, not only by being its own hardware supplier, but also by having worked closely with many global flight regulators on their regulatory process through the early days of commercial drone flights. They’re working with the FAA on its certification process now, for instance, with Plümmer saying that they participate in weekly calls with the regulator on its upcoming certification process for BVLOS drone operators. Understanding the regulatory environment, and even helping architect it, is a major selling point for partners who don’t want to have to build out that kind of expertise and regulatory team in-house.Meanwhile, the company will continue to act as an OEM as well, selling not only its Wingcopter 178 heavy-lift model, which can fly up to 75 miles, at speeds of up to 100 mph, and can carry payloads up to around 13 lbs. Because of its unique tilt-rotor mechanism, it’s not only more efficient in flight, but it can also fly in much windier conditions — and take-off and land in harsher conditions than most drones, too.Plümmer tells me that Wingcopter doesn’t intend to rest on its laurels in the hardware department, either; it’s going to be introducing a new model of drone soon, with different capabilities that expand the company’s addressable market, both as an OEM and in its drones-as-a-service business.With its U.S. expansion, Wingcopter will still look to focus specifically on the delivery market, but Plümmer points out that there’s no reason its unique technology couldn’t also work well to serve markets including observation and inspection, or to address needs in the communication space as well. The one market that Wingcopter doesn’t intend to pursue, however, is military and defense. While these are popular customers in the aerospace and drone industries, Plümmer says that Wingcopter has a mission “to create sustainable and efficient drone solutions for improving and saving lives,” and says the startup looks at every potential customer and ensures that it aligns with its vision — which defense customers do not.While the company has just announced the close of its Series A round, Plümmer says they’re already in talks with some potential investors to join a Series B. It’s also going to be looking for U.S.-based talent in embedded systems software and flight operations testing, to help with the testing process required by its certification from the FAA.German drone delivery trial paves the way to replacing trucks for inter-office deliveriesPlümmer sees a long tail of value to be built from Wingcopter’s patented tilt-rotor design, with potential applications in a range of industries, and he says that Wingcopter won’t be looking around for any potential M&A until it has fully realized that value. Meanwhile, the company is also starting to sow the seeds of its own potential future customers with training programs in drone flights and operations it’s putting on in partnership with UNICEF’s African Drone and Data Academy. Wingcopter clearly envisions a bright future for drone delivery, and its work in focusing its efforts on building differentiating hardware, plus the role it’s playing in setting the regulatory agenda globally, could help position it at the center of that future.']",Share on Twitter ,"['NavigationClose ScreenFeatured ArticleWingcopter', 'WingcopterGerman', 'Wingcopter', 'Xplorer Capital', 'Futury Regio Growth', 'Tom Plümmer', 'SV', 'FAA', 'Wingcopter', 'Vanuatu', 'BVLOS', 'Tom Plümmer', 'Jonas WreschWhile Wingcopter', 'Plümmer', 'Plümmer', 'BVLOS', 'Wingcopter', 'Wingcopter', 'Plümmer', 'VC', 'Plümmer', 'Wingcopter', 'Merck', 'FAA', 'BVLOS', 'Wingcopter', 'Wingcopter', 'Plümmer', 'Wingcopter', 'Plümmer', 'Wingcopter', 'Plümmer', 'FAA.German', 'Wingcopter’s', 'Wingcopter', 'African Drone', 'Data Academy', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'TechnologySeries', 'ArticleWingcopter', 'Wingcopter', 'Darrell', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/uKDEEbrFN8,2021-01-19T23:20:49,Elon Musk said it was ‘Not a Flamethrower’,"['After two days locked up in an Italian prison, American Max Craddock was finally able to make his case to a judge.“It’s not a weapon of war,” his lawyer told the investigating magistrate. “It’s a toy they sell to children.”Craddock had been arrested in the Sardinian port city of Olbia in June 2018 after trying to board a private party bus with a collectible flamethrower from Elon Musk’s latest startup, The Boring Company. Craddock had painted his flamethrower black, and written on it the name of a floating music festival in the Bahamas he had attended the previous year while starring in reality TV show Unanchored.Alarmed by the sight of what he thought was a gun, the bus driver refused to drive off, and then called the police.Elon Musk’s Boring Co. flamethrower is real, $500 and up for pre-order“They were very chill at first,” Craddock told TechCrunch in a recent phone interview. “But as the night went on, it kept getting worse. I spent the first night in jail in Olbia and then they took me to prison.”When Craddock managed to get a lawyer, she told him the judge would probably just let him go with a warning. Instead, the magistrate ordered him back to his cell. That was when Craddock, pictured below, learned possession of a flamethrower in Italy can carry a 10-year prison sentence.A few months later, author John Richardson was sitting down to work at his home in London when there was a loud knock at the door. He opened it and five police officers barged in wearing tasers and tactical gear.“I think a couple of them also had handguns,” Richardson told TechCrunch. “But I’m slightly hazy on that because my legs went wobbly.”The police officers sat Richardson down on his sofa and informed him that they had a warrant to search the premises. “I was like, ‘what’s going on here?’ ” Richardson recalled. “Then something clicked and I said, ‘Is this about the flamethrower?’ ”The raid was indeed about his flamethrower.Craddock and Richardson are not the only Boring Company customers to have fallen foul of law enforcement.More than 1,000 flamethrower purchasers abroad have had their devices confiscated by customs officers or local police, with many facing fines and weapons charges. In the U.S., the flamethrowers have been implicated in at least one local and one federal criminal investigation. There have also been at least three occasions in which the Boring Company devices have been featured in weapons hauls seized from suspected drug dealers.The upshot: What Musk and his army of fans thought was just another of his money-spinning larks is having real-world consequences for people and countries not in on the joke.The Boring Company did not respond to detailed questions from TechCrunch for this story.The spark of an ideaInspired by Los Angeles traffic, Musk launched The Boring Company in December 2016. The startup’s mission was to solve urban traffic jams by moving cars through tiny tunnels. But re-engineering sewer tunneling technology to build a revolutionary subterranean transportation network doesn’t come cheap. In an effort to drum up awareness and funds, Musk announced in December 2017 a limited run of novelty flamethrowers designed and branded by The Boring Company.It was a scheme that had produced results earlier that year. Musk raised $1 million just weeks after launching sales of a $20 Boring Company hat.“I’m a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie,” Musk told Joe Rogan during an infamous podcast in 2018. “They have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs, and, like, the kids love that one.”The device uses a standard propane gas canister and is functionally similar to propane torches for melting ice, killing weeds or applying roofing materials. But with its rifle-style stock, pistol grip and sci-fi styling, the Boring Company’s flamethrower had a very different aesthetic — more post-apocalyptic party accessory than everyday yard maintenance.Musk did his best to hype sales, tweeting to his Twitter followers, which numbered about 22 million at the time: “Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty ‘match’ to ignite!”Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 9, 2018He also threw a launch party in Los Angeles, where Craddock was one of the first 1,000 customers to collect a flamethrower, just before his European trip. “I removed the gas canister, put the flamethrower in my carry-on, and had no trouble on the flights,” he said.Musk’s influence and the appeal of the product provided a winning combination.“I had no intention of going around setting fire to stuff,” said Richardson. “I just thought it looked pretty cool, and was something I could potentially flip for a lot more money down the line.”The Boring Company would make 20,000 flamethrowers and sell them at $500 each, netting the young company $10 million.‘Not’ a FlamethrowerThe 20,000 flamethrowers quickly sold out, with orders flooding in from around the world. As the shipping date neared, however, The Boring Company realized its scorching new product could also be a legal hot potato.“We are told that various countries would ban shipping of it, that they would ban flamethrowers,” Musk told Rogan in 2018. “So, to solve this problem for all of the customs agencies, we labelled it, ‘Not a Flamethrower.’ ““Did it work? Was it effective?” asked Rogan. “I don’t know. I think so. Yes,” Musk replied.The correct answer was no.Elon Musk’s flamethrower has already made well over $3.5 millionIn London, the flamethrower came to the attention of Operation Viper, a rapid response team dedicated to tackling gun crime. Working with customs officials, Viper tracked Musk’s flamethrowers en route to the nation’s capital. “There has been a debate as to whether these are firearms,” one of the Viper officers wrote in an email to Richardson. “Similar flamethrowers have been seized right across London.” One Londoner had his laptop and several cellphones confiscated along with the flamethrower.Flamethrower raids were also happening around the U.K. and across Europe. A YouTube vlogger in Manchester was targeted by police after featuring the Boring Company’s gadget in one of his videos, while up to 1,000 purchasers in Switzerland had devices confiscated and were issued fines. One took his case to court, saying the flamethrower was little different from a school Bunsen burner. He lost.Not just a European problemWithout the immediacy of a Customs check, the backlash to Musk’s flamethrowers in the United States took longer to arrive. But in June 2019, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate introduced a bill that would criminalize owning and using Musk’s flamethrower.“Elon Musk’s Boring Company released a new flamethrower… without any concern to the training of the purchasers or their reasons for buying,” reads S1637. “This bill establishes that owning and using a flamethrower is a criminal act, unless it is used for agricultural, construction or historical collection purposes. These dangerous devices should not be sold to civilians, and use needs to be restricted to trained professionals.”Not every police force believes that new laws are necessary — finding that existing ones are enough. In June 2020, police in Springfield, Massachusetts stopped a car for a missing inspection sticker. One of the officers noticed what he thought was a rifle hidden beneath a seat — actually a Boring Company flamethrower. Its owner, passenger Brandon McGee, was charged with carrying a dangerous weapon and an “infernal machine” (a device for endangering life or property using fire).The same month, FBI agents executing a search warrant against a Pennsylvania man, Brandon Althof Long, stumbled across his Boring Company flamethrower propped against a wall. Long had been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to riot and cause civil disorder, and conspiracy to use fire to commit a felony, during riots in Ohio protesting police brutality.The agents seized the flamethrower out of concern for their safety, which a U.S. district judge later ruled lawful. “Other individuals could be located inside the house and the flamethrower could have been used to endanger officers as they retreated from Long’s home,” she wrote.Novel items like flamethrowers are rarely specified in law, says Ryan Calo, a law professor and co-founder of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington. “Some items – like guns or spring knives – are weapons ‘per se,’ meaning that they are always weapons. But most statutes have an ‘or other deadly weapon’ clause as well, meaning that anything that is capable of causing serious bodily harm, even a rock, can be a weapon in the right circumstances,” he said.The problem is, what circumstances? A flame-spouting weed-killer might not attract the interest of police, whereas a similar device styled like an assault rifle is more likely to be considered threatening. “And if you use the item during the commission of another crime, this can lead to a distinct offense of using a deadly weapon to commit a felony,” said Calo.For all Musk’s portrayal of the Not a Flamethrower as just an entertaining toy, police forces — and criminals — in North America are increasingly treating them as dangerous weapons. In rural Wisconsin, a two-year narcotics investigation led police to arrest two men in July 2020 with a hoard of drugs, cash and weapons. Among the cocaine, pistols and assault rifles prominently displayed in the traditional seizure photo was a Boring Company flamethrower. Similar seizures were displayed by police in Canada in December and again this month.Guelph Police Service lays out items seized including Not a Flamethrower, the novelty item sold by The Boring Company. Image credit: Guelph PoliceNo company has complete control over what customers do with its products. However, this isn’t the first time a product connected to Musk has been misused.Tesla, the electric automaker led by Musk, has been criticized for naming its advanced driver assistant system Autopilot and for calling the $10,000 add-on option Full Self-Driving (FSD), even though the driver must remain engaged at all times and is legally liable. A German court has banned the company from using the terms “Autopilot” or “full potential for autonomous driving” on its website or in other marketing materials.Elon Musk rails against German court decision on Tesla Autopilot terminologySafety advocates have argued that using terms like Autopilot and FSD misrepresents the capabilities of the system. The name, along with the lack of an in-cabin camera that monitors the driver, has led owners to push well beyond the bounds of the system.Videos showing Tesla owners misusing Autopilot and FSD abound on YouTube. Some have had run-ins with law enforcement. One Canadian man was charged for sleeping in his Tesla as it drove down the highway.Eternal flameImage Credits: Bryce DurbinJohn Richardson eventually got his Not a Flamethrower back from the Metropolitan police. He now intends to keep it out of the public eye, at least until it’s worth selling. “I’m happy to sit on it for however long,” he said. “And if there is a zombie apocalypse, at least I’ve got one.”For now, Craddock remains the only person that TechCrunch can identify as having been incarcerated solely for possessing a Not a Flamethrower. “It was a hair-raising experience,” he said. “I’m in the middle of nowhere in Sardinia, on 24-hour lockdown with an older guy giving off Mafia vibes.”After nearly a week in prison, Craddock was abruptly handed his belongings (flamethrower aside) and set free. “My lawyer asked the judge, ‘Do you really want to be the guy on international news keeping an American in jail over this toy?’ ” he said. “I think that was the key to getting me out.”Craddock took the first plane home. He says he now regrets taking the flamethrower abroad, and carrying it in public: “I would have preferred not to have spent that week in an Italian prison, but now I’ve got a hell of a story.”He also has another flamethrower.“As soon as I got back, I built myself a new one,” said Craddock. “You can follow YouTube videos with links to all the things you need.

https://t.co/dHE23Y1xRV,2021-01-22T21:20:50,End-to-end operators are the next generation of consumer business,"['Roger LeeContributorShare on Twitter Roger Lee is a general partner at Battery Ventures, based in Menlo Park, CA, who focuses on investments in software and consumer tech, including online marketplaces.\tMore posts by this contributorKeys to ascending the consumer-internet throneHow to communicate with your board in tough timesJustin Da RosaContributorShare on Twitter Justin Da Rosa is a vice president with Battery Ventures in San Francisco. He focuses on consumer internet, online marketplace and software investments.\tMore posts by this contributorFive success factors for behavioral health startupsAt Battery, a central part of our consumer investing practice involves tracking the evolution of where and how consumers find and purchase goods and services. From our annual Battery Marketplace Index, we’ve seen seismic shifts in how consumer purchasing behavior has changed over the years, starting with the move to the web and, more recently, to mobile and on-demand via smartphones.The evolution looks like this in a nutshell: In the early days, listing sites like Craigslist, Angie’s List* and Yelp effectively put the Yellow Pages online — you could find a new restaurant or plumber on the web, but the process of contacting them was largely still offline. As consumers grew more comfortable with the web, marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, Expedia and Wayfair* emerged, enabling historically offline transactions to occur online.More recently, and spurred in large part by mobile, on-demand use cases, managed marketplaces like Uber, DoorDash, Instacart and StockX* have taken online consumer purchasing a step further. They play a greater role in the operations of the marketplace, from automatically matching demand with supply, to verifying the supply side for quality, to dynamic pricing. \n\t\t\tThe key purpose of being end-to-end is to deliver an even better value proposition to consumers relative to incumbent alternatives.\t\t\t\t\tEach stage of this evolution unlocked billions of dollars in value, and many of the names listed above remain the largest consumer internet companies today.At their core, these companies are facilitators, matching consumer demand with existing supply of a product or service. While there is no doubt these companies play a hugely valuable role in our lives, we increasingly believe that simply facilitating a transaction or service isn’t enough. Particularly in industries where supply is scarce, or in old-guard industries where innovation in the underlying product or service is slow, a digitized marketplace — even when managed — can produce underwhelming experiences for consumers.In these instances, starting from the ground up is what is really required to deliver an optimal consumer experience. Back in 2014, Chris Dixon wrote a bit about this phenomenon in his post on “Full stack startups.” Fast forward several years, and more startups than ever are “full stack” or as we call it, “end-to-end operators.”These businesses are fundamentally reimagining their product experience by owning the entire value chain,\xa0from\xa0end to end, thereby creating a step-functionally better experience for consumers. Owning more in the stack of operations gives these companies better control over quality, customer service, delivery, pricing and more — which gives consumers a better, faster and cheaper experience.It’s worth noting that these end-to-end models typically require more capital to reach scale, as greater upfront investment is necessary to get them off the ground than other, more narrowly focused marketplaces.\xa0But in our experience, the additional capital required is often outweighed by the value captured from owning the entire experience.End-to-end operators span many verticalsMany of these businesses have reached meaningful scale across industries:Image Credits: Battery Ventures (opens in a new window)All of these companies have recognized they can deliver more value to consumers by “owning” every aspect of the underlying product or service — from the bike to the workout content in Peloton’s case, or the bank account to the credit card in Chime’s case. They have reinvented and reimagined the entire consumer experience, from end to end.What does success for end-to-end operator businesses look like?As investors, we’ve had the privilege of meeting with many of these next-generation end-to-end operators over the years and found that those with the greatest success tend to exhibit the five key elements below:1. Going after very large marketsThe end-to-end approach makes the most sense when disrupting very large markets. In the graphic above, notice that most of these companies play in the largest, but notoriously archaic industries like banking, insurance, real estate, healthcare, etc. Incumbents in these industries are very large and entrenched, but they are legacy players, making them slow to adopt new technology. For the most part, they have failed to meet the needs of our digital-native, mobile-savvy generation and their experiences lag behind consumer expectations of today (evidenced by low, or sometimes even negative, NPS scores). Rebuilding the experience from the ground up is sometimes the only way to satisfy today’s consumers in these massive markets.2.

https://t.co/8cgRlZEJNj,2021-01-24T17:46:04,Clubhouse announces plans for creator payments and raises new funding led by Andreessen Horowitz,"['Buzzy live-voice chat app Clubhouse has confirmed that it has raised new funding — without revealing how much — in a Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz through the firm’s partner Andrew Chen. The app was reported to be raising at a $1 billion valuation in a report from The Information that landed just before this confirmation. While we try to track down the actual value of this round (Update: Axios pegs it at $100 million) and the subsequent valuation of the company, what we do know is that Clubhouse has confirmed it will be introducing products to help creators on the platform get paid, including subscriptions, tipping and ticket sales.This funding round will also support a “Creator Grant Program” being set up by Clubhouse, which will be used to “support emerging Clubhouse creators” according to the startup’s blog post. While the app has done a remarkable job attracting creator talent, including high-profile celebrity and political users, directing revenue toward creators will definitely help spur sustained interest, as well as more time and investment from new creators who are potentially looking to make a name for themselves on the platform, similar to YouTube and TikTok influencers before them.Of course, adding monetization for users also introduces a method for Clubhouse itself to monetize. The platform is free to all users and doesn’t yet offer any kind of premium plan or method of charging users, nor is it ad-supported. Adding ways for users to pay other users provides an opportunity for Clubhouse to retain a cut for its services.Clubhouse voice chat leads a wave of spontaneous social appsThe plans around monetization routes for creators appear to be relatively open-ended at this point, with Clubhouse saying it’ll be launching “first tests” around each of the three areas it mentions (tipping, tickets and subscriptions) over the “next few months.” It sounds like these could be similar to something like a Patreon built right into the platform. Tickets are a unique option that would go well with Clubhouse’s more formal roundtable discussions and could also be a way that more organizations make use of the platform for hosting virtual events.The startup also announced that it will be starting work on its Android app (it’s been iOS-only for now) and that it will also invest in more backend scaling to keep up with demand, as well as support team growth and tools for detecting and prevuing abuse. Clubhouse has come under fire for its failure in regards to moderation and prevention of abuse in the past, so this aspect of its product development will likely be closely watched. The platform will also see changes to discovery aimed at surfacing relevant users, groups (“clubs” in the app’s parlance) and rooms.During a regular virtual town hall the app’s founders host on the platform, CEO Paul Davison revealed that Clubhouse now has 2 million weekly active users. It’s also worth noting that Clubhouse says it now has “over 180 investors” in the company, which is a lot for a Series B — though many of those are likely small, independent investors with very little stake.']",launch broadcast last week,"['Andreessen Horowitz', 'NavigationClose', 'Andreessen HorowitzDarrell Etherington@etherington /', 'Clubhouse', 'Andreessen Horowitz', 'Andrew Chen', 'Clubhouse', 'Clubhouse', 'YouTube', 'TikTok', 'Clubhouse', 'Patreon', 'Clubhouse’s', 'Android', 'Paul Davison', 'Clubhouse', 'Clubhouse', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'HorowitzAndrew', 'Andreessen HorowitzDarrell', 'Clubhouse', 'Andreessen Horowitz', 'Andre', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/C3iX83A7oF,2021-01-19T15:36:51,"In 2020, VCs invested $428M into US-based startups every day","['Despite a pandemic that sparked a global recession, 2020 was still a record year for venture capital investments into American startups.According to data shared by PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association, investors poured $156.2 billion into domestic startups last year, or around $428 million for each day of the year. The huge sum of money, however, was itself dwarfed by the amount of liquidity that American startups generated, some $290.1 billion.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.The exit-value figure was a record as well, as were the 321 rounds worth $100 million — nearly one for each day of the year.But while the U.S. venture capital market in 2020 was hot, it was not newly so. In 2018 and 2019, VCs invested around $140 billion into domestic startups, making last year’s $156 billion result a record, but not a shocking departure from previous years.A first read of the data indicates that the U.S. venture capital market is still getting larger in scale and later-stage in focus. But inside those well-worn trends are a host of notable movements that both underscore what we observed last year in real-time\xa0and teach us something new about today’s venture capital market.So far, 2021’s startup financing and exit market appears to be the mirror of what we saw in late 2020. So we’d best understand the past so we can forecast what we’ll see in Q1 of 2021.To avoid getting too lost in the data, we’ll proceed by stage, pulling out key facts for each step of the startup lifecycle. Feel free to scroll to the one that makes the most sense for where your company is or where your fund invests.SeedIn the U.S., seed deal count was high in 2020, around 5,227 per PitchBook’s estimates. Those rounds were worth just over $10 billion, making it the third year in a row in which American seed-stage startups managed around $10 billion in capital against around 5,000 rounds.Boring, yeah? Not really. Inside those numbers are the whole year’s ups and downs: The fact that the seed data is so close to 2018 and 2019 levels is almost silly.The real surprise from seed, per PitchBook’s report, is that these valuations actually fell on a year-over-year basis in 2020. This, despite the fact that seed deal sizes rose.Considering these two trends at once, it appears likely that, on average, VC ownership as a percentage of seed-stage companies rose in 2020.Frankly I was just surprised to see a form of startup valuation decrease after expanding for nearly a decade.']",Share on Twitter ,"['Nigel Sussman', 'PitchBook', 'the National Venture Capital Association', 'Exchange', 'Exchange', 'PitchBook’s', 'PitchBook', 'VC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'CapitalpitchbookThe Exchangeventure', 'Alex Wilhelm4:36', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/VL21sVC0sw,2021-01-24T16:44:40,SpaceX sets new record for most satellites on a single launch with latest Falcon 9 mission,"['SpaceX has set a new all-time record for the most satellites launched and deployed on a single mission, with its Transporter-1 flight on Sunday. The launch was the first of SpaceX’s dedicated rideshare missions, in which it splits up the payload capacity of its rocket among multiple customers, resulting in a reduced cost for each but still providing SpaceX with a full launch and all the revenue it requires to justify lauding one of its vehicles.The launch today included 143 satellites, 133 of which were from other companies who booked rides. SpaceX also launched 10 of its own Starlink satellites, adding to the already more than 1,000 already sent to orbit to power SpaceX’s own broadband communication network. During a launch broadcast last week, SpaceX revealed that it has begun serving beta customers in Canada and is expanding to the U.K. with its private pre-launch test of that service.Customers on today’s launch included Planet Labs, which sent up 48 SuperDove Earth imaging satellites; Swarm, which sent up 36 of its own tiny IoT communications satellites, and Kepler, which added to its constellation with eight more of its own communication spacecraft. The rideshare model that SpaceX now has in place should help smaller new space companies and startups like these build out their operational on-orbit constellations faster, complementing other small payload launchers like Rocket Lab, and new entrant Virgin Orbit, to name a few.This SpaceX launch was also the first to deliver Starlink satellites to a polar orbit, which is a key part of the company’s continued expansion of its broadband service. The mission also included a successful landing and recovery of the Falcon 9 rocket’s first-stage booster, the fifth for this particular booster, and a dual recovery of the fairing halves used to protect the cargo during launch, which were fished out of the Atlantic ocean using its recovery vessels and will be refurbished and reused.Kepler will build its small satellites at a new manufacturing facility in Toronto']", infrastructure bets,"['Falcon', 'NavigationClose', 'SpaceXSpaceX', 'Planet Labs', 'Swarm', 'Kepler', 'Rocket Lab', 'Virgin Orbit', 'Falcon', 'Kepler', 'TorontoclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Etherington5:44 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/VJoff2gjch,2021-01-19T20:15:22,How and when to build marketing teams at deep tech companies,"['Jessica LiContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tJessica is on the growth marketing team at Zageno, a multivendor, online marketplace for life science products, and is head of content at Elpha, a Y Combinator-backed community of 40,000+ women in tech. \tMore posts by this contributor4 strategies for deep tech startups recruiting top growth marketers4 strategies for deep tech founders who are fundraisingDeep tech startups develop cutting-edge innovations with the power to truly revolutionize society. The founding team members at these companies often come from deeply technical backgrounds, which powers rapid product progress but can create bottlenecks on the go-to-market side.In this post, I outline the answers to four key questions around marketing at early-stage deep tech companies that are post-revenue:What marketing teams at deep tech companies do.When to hire the marketing team.Whether the marketing team needs industry experience.How to source and evaluate talent for the marketing team.From this post, deep tech startups can formulate their marketing hiring strategy and attract and cultivate top talent to drive their go-to-market plan. Without business execution, even the most groundbreaking innovations do not achieve their intended impact.What do marketing teams at deep tech companies do? To set the context, I share below the typical projects of deep tech marketing teams, which look different from marketing in other industries given the greater product focus and complexity, regulatory oversight and longer time to market.Go-to-marketMarketers leverage the strength of the IP to establish collaborations with large companies, such as pharma companies and institutions, such as the government, universities or hospitals. To this end, marketers develop creative ways to gather lists of, and information on, key contacts at these potential partners. They also build sales collateral, such as demo videos, pitch decks and one-pagers, to more effectively reach and build long-term relationships with these prospects.More broadly, marketers also develop the go-to-market strategy beyond partnerships. To this end, marketers conduct in-depth market research on business models, monetization strategies and reimbursement channels.CommunicationsMarketers create original content to establish the company as a thought leader, build the company’s brand credibility through social media and apply for awards and honors to validate the potential of the company’s solution.ForecastingMarketers work with finance and product teams to formulate projections as the company moves into the clinical phase.When should deep tech companies hire marketers?The CEO and other members of the founding team take on marketing work in the formation stage to better understand and empathize with the needs, capabilities and opportunities in the department before bringing someone on full time.Once the product shows signs of repeatable revenue, a marketing lead is needed. Specifically, this is ahead of a large Series A round, after a small Series A round or when a commercial partner has expressed interest in larger, long-term contracts. Instead of the typical chief marketing officer or chief revenue officer title, deep tech startups call this person a chief commercial officer or chief partnerships officer.For additional support in the formation stage, companies bring on MBA interns and work with their investors. Prior to the Series A, platform teams at deep tech venture-capital funds are hands-on in helping with marketing through actually doing marketing projects for their portfolio companies, ideating on long-term marketing strategy with the founders through regular feedback sessions and connecting founders with vetted marketing contractors or agencies.For companies that require FDA approval, commercial advisors, consultants and board members fully take on the partnership strategy work (which represents the bulk of the marketing needs) prior to the Series A round. Similarly, external consultants, such as marketing agencies, can take over major projects like launch strategy. External consultants can then join the team should their performance be strong.For drug-development companies, the marketing leader is most crucial when the company enters the clinical phase and prepares for trials, regardless of funding stage.Do marketing hires need industry experience? Of course, it is ideal to hire someone with experience selling into the space and someone who is comfortable with the complex supply chains and long sales cycles. However, if the choice is between someone with functional expertise but no industry expertise and someone with industry experience but limited or no functional expertise, it is better to hire the former candidate and leverage the rest of the team for domain expertise. Deep tech is a niche area, so the other team members can support the marketer in developing industry expertise.']",Share on Twitter ,"['Li@jessicafeiyali', 'Andy Roberts', 'Getty ImagesJessica', 'Jessica', 'IP', 'ForecastingMarketers', 'FDA', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsColumnLaborStartupsTCdeep techEC', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/IF0pI5JxsZ,2021-01-19T18:01:34,6 investors on 2021’s mobile gaming trends and opportunities,"['Many VCs historically avoided placing bets on hit-driven mobile gaming content in favor of clearer platform opportunities, but as more success stories pop up, the economics overturned conventional wisdom with new business models. As more accessible infrastructure allowed young studios to become more ambitious, venture money began pouring into the gaming ecosystem.After tackling topics including how investors are looking at opportunities in social gaming, infrastructure bets and the moonshots of AR/VR, I asked a group of VCs about their approach to mobile content investing and whether new platforms were changing perspectives about opportunities in mobile-first and desktop-first experiences.While desktop gaming has evolved dramatically in the past few years as new business models and platforms take hold, to some degree, mobile has been hampered. Investors I chatted with openly worried that some of mobile’s opportunities were being hamstrung by Apple’s App Store.“We are definitely fearful of Apple’s ability to completely disrupt/affect the growth of a game,” Bessemer’s Ethan Kurzweil and Sakib Dadi told TechCrunch. “We do not foresee that changing any time in the near future despite the outcry from companies such as Epic and others.”All the while, another central focus seems to be the ever-evolving push toward cross-platform gaming, which is getting further bolstered by new technologies. One area of interest for investors: migrating the ambition of desktop titles to mobile and finding ways to build cross-platform experiences that feel fulfilling on devices that are so differently abled performance-wise.Madrona’s Hope Cochran, who previously served as CFO of Candy Crush maker King, said mobile still has plenty of untapped opportunities. “When you have a AAA game, bringing it to mobile is challenging and yet it opens up an entire universe of scale.”Responses have been edited for length and clarity. We spoke with:Hope Cochran, managing director, Madrona Venture GroupDaniel Li, partner, Madrona Venture GroupEthan Kurzweil, partner, Bessemer Venture PartnersSakib Dadi, investor, Bessemer Venture PartnersAlice Lloyd George, founding partner, Rogue VCGigi Levy-Weiss, general partner, NFXHope Cochran and Daniel Li, Madrona Venture GroupDoes it ever get any easier to bet on a gaming content play? What do you look for?Hope Cochran: I feel like there are a couple different sectors in gaming. There’s the actual studios that are developing games and they have several approaches. Are they developing a brand new game, are they reimagining a game from 25 years ago and reskinning it, which is a big trend right now, or are they taking IP that is really trendy right now and trying to create a game around it? There are different ways to predict which ones of those might make it, but then there’s also the infrastructure behind gaming and then there’s also identifying trends and which games or studios are embracing those. Those are some of the ways I try to parse it out and figure out which ones I think are going to rise to the top of the list.Daniel Li: There’s this single-player narrative versus multiplayer metaverse and I think people are more comfortable on the metaverse stuff because if you’re building a social network and seeing good early traction, those things don’t typically just disappear. Then if you are betting more on individual studios producing games, I think the other thing is we’re seeing more and more VCs pop up that are just totally games-focused or devoting a portion of the portfolio to games. And for them it’s okay to have a hits-driven portfolio.There seems to be more innovation happening on PC/console in terms of business models and distribution, do you think mobile feels less experimental these days? Why or why not?Hope Cochran: Mobile is still trying to push the technology forward, the important element of being cross-platform is difficult. When you have a AAA game, bringing it to mobile is challenging and yet it opens up an entire universe of scale. The metrics are also very different for mobile though.Daniel Li: It seems like the big monetization innovation that has happened over the last couple of years has been the “battle pass” type of subscription where you can unlock more content by playing. Obviously that’s gone over to mobile, but it doesn’t feel like mobile has had some sort of new monetization unlock. The other thing that’s happened on desktop is the success of the “pay $10 or $20 or $20 for this indie game” type of thing, and it feels like that’s not going to happen on mobile because of the price points that people are used to paying.Alice Lloyd George, Rogue VC']",Share on Twitter ,"['Apple', 'AR/VR', 'Apple’s App Store', 'Apple', 'Bessemer’s', 'Ethan Kurzweil', 'Sakib Dadi', 'Madrona', 'Cochran', 'CFO', 'Candy Crush', 'AAA', 'Cochran', 'Madrona Venture', 'GroupDaniel Li', 'Madrona Venture', 'GroupEthan Kurzweil', 'Bessemer Venture PartnersSakib Dadi', 'Bessemer Venture PartnersAlice Lloyd George', 'VCGigi Levy-Weiss', 'Cochran', 'Daniel Li', 'Madrona Venture GroupDoes', 'Cochran', 'IP', 'Daniel Li', 'Cochran', 'AAA', 'Daniel Li', 'Alice Lloyd George', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Levy-WeissHope Cochraninvestor', 'Lucas Matney7:01 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/eF334lNi5b,2020-11-17T17:41:29,Construction tech startups are poised to shake up a $1.3-trillion-dollar industry,"['Allison XuContributorShare on Twitter Allison Xu is an investor at Bain Capital Ventures, where she focuses on investments in the fintech and property tech sectors.\tIn the wake of COVID-19 this spring, construction sites across the nation emptied out alongside neighboring restaurants, retail stores, offices and other commercial establishments. Debates ensued over whether the construction industry’s seven million employees should be considered “essential,” while regulations continued to shift on the operation of job sites. Meanwhile, project demand steadily shrank.Amidst the chaos, construction firms faced an existential question: How will they survive? This question is as relevant today as it was in April. As one of the least-digitized sectors of our economy, construction is ripe for technology disruption.Construction is a massive, $1.3 trillion industry in the United States — a complex ecosystem of lenders, owners, developers, architects, general contractors, subcontractors and more. While each construction project has a combination of these key roles, the construction process itself is highly variable depending on the asset type. Roughly 41% of domestic construction value is in residential property, 25% in commercial property and 34% in industrial projects. Because each asset type, and even subassets within these classes, tends to involve a different set of stakeholders and processes, most construction firms specialize in one or a few asset groups.Regardless of asset type, there are four key challenges across construction projects:High fragmentation: Beyond the developer, architect, engineer and general contractor, projects could involve hundreds of subcontractors with specialized expertise. As the scope of the project increases, coordination among parties becomes increasingly difficult and decision-making slows.Poor communication: With so many different parties both in the field and in the office, it is often difficult to relay information from one party to the next. Miscommunication and poor project data accounts for 48% of all rework on U.S. construction job sites, costing the industry over $31 billion annually according to FMI research.Lack of data transparency: Manual data collection and data entry are still common on construction sites. On top of being laborious and error-prone, the lack of real-time data is extremely limited, therefore decision-making is often based on outdated information.Skilled labor shortage: The construction workforce is aging faster than the younger population that joins it, resulting in a shortage of labor particularly for skilled trades that may require years of training and certifications. The shortage drives up labor costs across the industry, particularly in the residential sector, which traditionally sees higher attrition due to its more variable project demand.A construction tech boomToo many of the key processes involved in managing multimillion-dollar construction projects are carried out on Excel or even with pen and paper. The lack of tech sophistication on construction sites materially contributes to job delays, missed budgets and increased job site safety risk. Technology startups are emerging to help solve these problems.Image Credits: Bain Capital Ventures (opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)Here are the main categories in which we’re seeing construction tech startups emerge.1. Project conceptionHow it works today: During a project’s conception, asset owners and/or developers develop site proposals and may work with lenders to manage the project financing.Key challenges: Processes for managing construction loans are cumbersome and time intensive today given the complexity of the loan draw process.How technology can address challenges: Design software such as Spacemaker AI can help developers create site proposals, while construction loan financing software such as Built Technologies and Rabbet are helping lenders and developers manage the draw process in a more efficient manner.2. Design and engineeringHow it works today: Developers work with design, architect and engineering teams to turn ideas into blueprints.Key challenges: Because the design and engineering teams are often siloed from the contractors, it’s hard for designers and engineers to know the real-time impact of their decisions on the ultimate cost or timing of the project. Lack of coordination with construction teams can lead to time-consuming changes.How technology can address challenges: Of all the elements of the construction process, the design and engineering process itself is the most technologically sophisticated today, with relatively high adoption of software like Autodesk to help with design documentation, specification development, quality assurance and more. Autodesk is moving downstream to offer a suite of solutions that includes construction management, providing more connectivity between the teams.']",offering it introduced in 2019,"['Xu@allisoncxu', 'Steve Proehl', 'Getty ImagesAllison', 'Twitter Allison Xu', 'Bain Capital Ventures', 'FMI', 'Bain Capital Ventures', 'Spacemaker AI', 'Built Technologies', 'manner.2', 'Autodesk', 'Autodesk', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'industryAllison Xu6:41 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/OFbSBqnOef,2021-01-24T14:30:38,How emerging markets are approaching crypto,"['Leigh CuenContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tLeigh Cuen is a reporter in New York City. Her work has been published by Vice, Business Insider, Newsweek, Teen Vogue, Al Jazeera English, The Jerusalem Post, and many others. Follow her on Instagram at @leighcuen.\tMore posts by this contributorMeet the entrepreneurs bringing bitcoin to institutionsHow Bitcoin is helping middle-class users survive the pandemicFrom Brazil to Nigeria, people turn to Bitcoin for different reasons than most of their speculating counterparts in North America. Namely, because it’s the most advantageous way for them to conduct international transactions.\xa0Such is the case with a 28-year-old poker player in Brazil who simply goes by Felipe, for safety. Poker is a legal form of gambling in Brazil, so Felipe can use Brazilian banks and regulated exchanges to earn income from home. He dropped out of law school because playing poker against foreigners with Bitcoin to spend was more profitable than becoming a partner at a local law firm. Felipe said he now outearns his brother, a middle-tier executive at one of Brazil’s top corporations.\xa0“Bitcoin is the best medium of money exchange in the poker community,” Felipe said. “I withdraw earnings as Bitcoin, or as Tether, to a Brazilian crypto exchange and sell it there.”Felipe said he is wary of his government because he believes the Brazilian economy will experience a catastrophic shock in the next few years. Back in 1992, President Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached after confiscating millions of civilian savings accounts to offset national debts. Felipe doesn’t want his bank account forcibly emptied when the next crisis hits. This inspires him to accumulate Bitcoin, avoiding more traditional options stocks.\xa0“The pension funds system is completely broken,” Felipe added. “The thing with Bitcoin is, you don’t need it until you do.”\xa0Manuel Folgueiras is one of many Cuban users who joined the Bitcoin ecosystem over the past year. This 33-year-old economist, who lost his tourism industry job in 2020, now supports himself using various cryptocurrency projects. “It’s very difficult to get Bitcoin, because we don’t have access to any exchanges and there are a lot of scams. Cuban banks don’t have relationships with crypto exchanges,” Folgueiras said. “Now I use Bitcoin for both savings and income, through trading arbitrage. We have to use a VPN and it’s very risky. If the exchange detects that you’re from Cuba, your account will get blocked.”Global demand for Bitcoin has been surging since the pandemic began in 2020, pushing dollar-denominated prices briefly past $34,000 during the first week of January, 2021. For residents in many emerging markets, demand for Bitcoin is driven by concerns about the overall health of their national economies, not pure speculation. Some of these countries where Bitcoin markets are spiking, especially in Latin America and the Middle East, are seeing their domestic economies tailspin and are worried political controls could further threaten economic stability.Bitcoin passes $20K and reaches all-time highFor example, since Western Union stopped operating in Cuba, more Cubans are using Bitcoin than ever before. For people in a variety of countries, pandemic policy changes reduced access to the dollar-centric financial system.Folgueiras estimated he is one of roughly 80,000 people on the island involved in an unofficial brokerage business called Trust Investing, often called a Ponzi scheme by local technologists. In short, the business promises to trade cryptocurrency on behalf of “investors,” to whom they deposit lucrative returns. The project promises 200% returns, which seems impossible, and references questionable “partners” on the Trust Investing website.\xa0Those partner companies are registered to people associated with a variety of\xa0court cases\xa0across Latin America and,\xa0both\xa0Panama’s\xa0Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores (SMV)\xa0and Spain’s\xa0National Securities Market Commission\xa0(CNMV) published\xa0warnings not to trust the Trust Investing company itself. Even Folgueiras acknowledged that many people call this business a scam. But he said returns from the Trust Investing program are helping him survive the abysmal job market. It’s a gamble whether the company will give him returns or run away with his money, a risk he’s willing to take.\xa0Plus, Folgueiras added, any form of Bitcoin business in Cuba is already “very risky.” There aren’t many regulated, trustworthy exchanges openly serving Cubans today, due to U.S. sanctions. Aside from the remittance startup, BitRemesas, the last compliance-oriented startup that tried serving this market shut down in 2019. As such, many Cubans turn to questionable schemes, or WhatsApp, instead.\xa0“Cubans get Bitcoin via WhatsApp groups, peer-to-peer trading. The most popular mobile wallets are Coinomi, Enjin Wallet and Trust Wallet, because most people in Cuba only use a cell phone. It’s a mobile-only market,” Folgueiras said. “Bitcoin changed my life in a positive way and became an important source of income. Cryptocurrencies are also an interesting way for Cubans to shop online and send international payments or remittances.”\xa0With investors expecting a Latin American cryptocurrency boom, Mexico’s Bitso raises $62 millionThis grassroots, mobile-only environment is common across many small countries with underdeveloped economics. Likewise, Fodé Diop, founder of the Dakar Bitcoin Developers meetup in Senegal, told CoinDesk last year that Senegal was not just a mobile-first market; it’s a mobile-only Bitcoin scene. Unlike North America and Europe, many emerging-market crypto communities only use cell phones for everything from research and trading to storage.\xa0On the other hand, it would be a mistake to assume most emerging-market Bitcoin users are marginalized by the global banking system. To the contrary, in countries like Nigeria and Brazil, many upper-middle-class entrepreneurs and gamers use Bitcoin to conduct perfectly legal business. According to data from the global peer-to-peer (P2P) markets LocalBitcoins and Paxful, there were more than $25.3 million worth of P2P Bitcoin trades last year in Brazil alone.\xa0Meanwhile, in Africa, Nigerian P2P Bitcoin volumes dwarf those numbers with a cool $357 million. Likewise, BuyCoins co-founder Tomiwa Lasebikan said his Nigerian cryptocurrency exchange ballooned from an average of $5 million in monthly volume in December 2019 to $21 million by December 2020.\xa0He said several factors spurred local growth, including anti-police brutality activists like the Nigerian Feminist Coalition, which collected bitcoin donations after being denied banking access, and stricter banking limitations on Nigerians paying for international services.“A lot of people in Nigeria are running into a problem that they couldn’t renew subscriptions, like Spotify or Amazon, with their Nigerian accounts,” Lasebikan said. “Then, in October, there was a whole lot of interest in cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin, for aggregating donations for people protesting police brutality. A lot of activists had their bank accounts shut down. Continued fundraising like this, both inside and outside the country, would not have been possible two decades ago.”\xa0He added his exchange startup now serves roughly 12,000 active users a month. Nearby, Binance communications lead in Africa, Damilola Odufuwa, said her global exchange company facilitated hundreds of virtual events for 70,000 Nigerian crypto beginners in 2020. These educational programs covered basic terminology, trading strategies and guides to opening exchange accounts.\xa0“During the pandemic, it was hard to get things into the country, including remittances,” Odufuwa said. “Now there’s also this need to use cryptocurrency to donate [to activists]…we plan to at least quadruple educational programming this year.”How Bitcoin is helping middle-class users survive the pandemicDepending on the user’s socioeconomic background, people use Bitcoin to earn income from online games like poker, trading cryptocurrencies or offering freelance services to international clients. Odufuwa said thousands of the new users she’s seen during the pandemic want to profit from their developer skills, not just trades. So her company will offer more developer training related to the open-source Binance Smart Chain project. Although it’s impossible to accurately quantify, it seems as though at least hundreds of freelancers around the globe now depend on Bitcoin for income.\xa0One such LocalBitcoins user in Latin American, Venezuelan journalist José Rafael Peña, has been earning the majority of his income in Bitcoin since late 2016. He estimated that cryptocurrency writing gigs account for 90% of his income.\xa0“Bitcoin, in some circumstances, is a very helpful tool, especially when you live in a country with a chaotic economy and limited financial tools,” Peña said. “I began using Bitcoin because it let me protect against the bolivar’s devaluation, even without a dollar bank account.”All things considered, Odufuwa said emerging markets saw “tremendous” growth since the pandemic began. But Peña warned not to confuse that growth with a mainstream “solution” to local government woes.\xa0“Most people try to survive the crisis in any way,” he said. “Even here, crypto is a niche.”\xa0']",according to a new report,"['NavigationClose', 'Leigh Cuen', 'Business Insider', 'Newsweek', 'Teen Vogue', 'Al Jazeera English', 'The Jerusalem Post', 'Bitcoin', 'Felipe', 'Poker', 'Felipe', 'Felipe', 'Bitcoin', 'Felipe', 'Bitcoin', 'Tether', 'Fernando Collor de Mello', 'Bitcoin', 'Felipe', 'Bitcoin', 'Manuel Folgueiras', 'Bitcoin', 'VPN', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'Western Union', 'Bitcoin', 'Ponzi', 'del Mercado de Valores', 'National Securities Market Commission', 'Folgueiras', 'BitRemesas', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Trust Wallet', 'Mexico’s Bitso', 'Fodé Diop', 'CoinDesk', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'BuyCoins', 'Tomiwa Lasebikan', 'the Nigerian Feminist Coalition', 'Spotify', 'Amazon', 'Lasebikan', 'Bitcoin', 'Binance', 'Odufuwa', 'Bitcoin', 'Odufuwa', 'Binance Smart Chain', 'LocalBitcoins', 'José Rafael Peña', 'Bitcoin', 'Odufuwa', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/JjZIqRCBxw,2021-01-24T14:06:33,"Watch SpaceX’s first dedicated rideshare rocket launch live, carrying a record-breaking payload of satellites","['\xa0SpaceX is set to launch the very first of its dedicated rideshare missions — an offering it introduced in 2019 that allows small satellite operators to book a portion of a payload on a Falcon 9 launch. SpaceX’s rocket has a relatively high payload capacity compared to the size of many of the small satellites produced today, so a rideshare mission like this offers smaller companies and startups a chance to get their spacecraft in orbit without breaking the bank. Today’s attempt is scheduled for 10 a.m. EST (7 a.m. PST) after a first try yesterday was cancelled due to weather. So far, weather looks much better for today.The cargo capsule atop the Falcon 9 flying today holds a total of 143 satellites according to SpaceX, which is a new record for the highest number of satellites being launched on a single rocket — beating out a payload of 104 spacecraft delivered by Indian Space Research Organization’s PSLV-C37 launch back in February 2017. It’ll be a key demonstration not only of SpaceX’s rideshare capabilities, but also of the complex coordination involved in a launch that includes deployment of multiple payloads into different target orbits in relatively quick succession.SpaceX will now offer dedicated ‘rideshare’ launches for small satellitesThis launch will be closely watched in particular for its handling of orbital traffic management, since it definitely heralds what the future of private space launches could look like in terms of volume of activity. Some of the satellites flying on this mission are not much larger than an iPad, so industry experts will be paying close attention to how they’re deployed and tracked to avoid any potential conflicts.Some of the payloads being launched today include significant volumes of startup spacecraft, including 36 of Swarm’s tiny IoT network satellites\xa0and eight of Kepler’s GEN-1 communications satellites. There are also 10 of SpaceX’s own Starlink satellites on board and 48 of Planet Labs’ Earth-imaging spacecraft.The launch stream above should begin around 15 minutes prior to the mission start, which is set for 10 a.m. EST (7 a.m. PST) today.']",broader venture capital results,"['NavigationClose ScreenWatch', 'Falcon', 'PST', 'Falcon', 'Indian Space Research Organization’s PSLV-C37', 'iPad', 'IoT', 'Kepler’s', 'PST', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Etherington3:06', 'Falco', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/1obP8P2lPY,2021-01-24T05:00:47,8 investors tell us the story behind the Romanian startup boom,"['With record funding levels and three unicorns to show, local investors are buoyant about Romania’s prospects heading into 2021. We caught up with eight of them recently, and heard how the country’s technical talent pool, broadband access and low cost of living have positioned it for the era of remote-first global companies across industries.The momentum from last year includes 58 startups that raised total funding of €30.39 million, according to a new report just out from long-time Romanian conference How To Web. This represents a 6% increase in the volume of investments overall, and a 51% increase of investments year on year overall. A significant part of these numbers came from companies raising money for the first time.Key industries include cybersecurity, enterprise software and fintech, with many “super-geeky teams, with deep expertise in the field” as one investor put it. “We are very focused on Romanian founders,” said another. But because of significant emigration in recent years, “they can reside and launch anywhere in the world.”Here are the investors in their own words, for any TechCrunch reader who is interested in hiring, investing or founding a company in the country:Cristian Negrutiu, Founding Partner, Sparking CapitalCristian Munteanu, Managing partner, Early Game VenturesAndrei Pitis, Founding Partner, Simple CapitalBogdan Axinia, Managing Partner, eMAG VenturesDan Mihaescu, Founding Partner, GapMinder VenturesAlexandru Popescu, Managing Partner, Cleverage Venture CapitalTheodor Genoiu, Associate, Roca XMatei Dumitrescu, Founding Partner, Impact CapitalOh, and one more thing.

On a personal note, I’m interested in verticals like supply chain, mobility, proptech, circular/sharing economy.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nOur latest investment is a start-up in the digital fitness industry.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nI would like to see more solutions in supply chain, as I believed that this industry needs a paradigm shift.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\n1. Relevant market 2. Good product 3. Excellent team 4. Fit with usWhich areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nI believe that in marketing and finance is difficult to enter or you need something really different. In terms of products/services, marketplaces need to evolve in order to be competitiveHow much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nWe are strongly focused on RomaniaWhich industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nRomanian ecosystem is still in infancy, but with a high velocity and very good prospects for the future. I believe that we will see soon more Romanian unicorns, including from our portfolioHow should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nAs said above – still in early stages, but full of opportunities and going full speedDo you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nNot for Romania. The ecosystem is still based on few cities like Bucharest, Cluj, Iasi and the hubs within those citiesWhich industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nApart from traditional HoReCa (Hotel/Restaurant/Café) businesses and overall trends, we didn’t see much impact. Actually, any start-up that promotes digitization in a specific industry (e.g. proptech) gained momentum in this period.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?\nWe tried to be as normal as possible and maintain a steady flow of business. We advise founders to look after their teams and customers and be careful with cashAre you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes, as mentioned above.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nWe always need to be positive and not exaggerate about the pandemic. It will pass.Cristian Munteanu, Managing partner, Early Game VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nGiven our limited geographical scope (we invest only in Romania), we have to have a generic approach and consider many verticals and trends. Just as an example, we are looking at startups applying technologies that reached mass adoption to niche fields: computer vision applied to specific crops (agritech) or applied to in-store customer behaviour (martech); biometric data (collected through wearable devices) applied to group interactions as opposed to single individuals; ultra-light blockchain ledgers applied to smart buildings… From another investment perspective, we are looking to invest in what we call “the infrastructure for innovation” such as startups building APIs — we believe that Romania is not yet API-fied enough.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nThe last term sheet we signed was with a startup that is building technology to help enterprise-level companies to better manage their software licenses. Super-geeky team, with deep expertise in the field, creating a lot of value to their customers.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nI would like to find great teams trying to make in-game payments easier (building at the intersection of payments and gaming), or working on Irrigation-as-a-Service (agritech), or building a NASDAQ for energy.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nI am looking for founders that are both super competent and brave. Such people will dare tackle big problems and will have a chance to succeed at solving it.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nI’ve seen too many startups building apps to help people find parking spots, too many marketplaces that no one need, too much off the shelf technology for marketing, too many CRMs and ERPs.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nWe are investing only in Romania — 100% committed to the local ecosystem.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nI think that, given the natural potential of Romania, agritech has a big chance; still this space is not fully serviced yet. Otherwise, cybersecurity, enterprise software, and fintech are quite well represented. From our portfolio of almost 20 startups, CODA is enabling managed service providers with cybersecurity skills; Humans is building a hub for synthetic media technologies; Mechine is making agricultural equipment speak to each other; Tokinomo is collecting and analyzing data from the shelf (in-store marketing); BunnyShell is building next-gen cloud tech and making it easy for anyone to set up servers in three clicks.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nThe startup ecosystem in Romania is very young, with the first local VC funds established three years ago with support from the European Investment Fund. And yet, Romania is home to three unicorns and many other promising startups. The large technical talent pool, the widely spread broadband access and the low costs of doing business and living turn Romania into a market to keep an eye on.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nI expect founders from the big cities to stay in the big cities as setting up and working for a startup does not mean writing code on the laptop from a remote beach. In the tormenting search for product-market fit, founders need to talk business, visit partners, sign contracts, attend events, meet peers, do surveys, prototype and one thousand other things that cannot be done on Zoom to their full extent. The tech industry and the startupland took a hit from the pandemic as the rest of the world. And just as the rest of the world, they will survive, adapt, and mostly return to the normal interactions from before March 2020.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nUnfortunately, I saw urban mobility apps suffer from the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Also, anything related to restaurants, hotels and conventional events was badly affected. We are invested in startups in these verticals and made everything we could to help them during the worst days of the pandemic.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nOur fund registered a 20% decrease in the numbers of investments in 2020 compared to 2019 and a 40% decrease in the total value of deals; so the impact of COVID was significant. At the same time, in terms of fund performance, 2020 was a good year, with companies in our portfolio raising new investment rounds with outside investors, increasing their valuation, and showing good returns. The first half of 2020 was dedicated to damage control measures and supporting the portfolio companies, but the situation changed towards the end of the year, with high new deals activity in the last quarter (higher than in Q4 2019). VC-backed startups had investors to turn to in harsh times and benefited from support and additional funds when needed; things were much more difficult for the rest of the startups though.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nProbably the first thing we noticed the moment the pandemic started was a peak in productivity. During the months of mandatory shelter at home, the early-stage startups working on their prototypes put in extra-hours and gained speed. Personnel retention was good, people were focused, there was a positive spirit and a general desire to make things happen. Indeed, some startups reported an immediate boost of sales, such as Tokinomo whose robots replace the human promoters in supermarkets.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nThe highlight of 2020 was the week I spent on a magnificent yacht sailing with friends through the islands in Greece. It was a recharging moment that gave me a boost for the rest of the year. The next elating moment came in December with the Series A investments that increased our fund’s performance.Andrei Pitis, Founding partner, Simple CapitalWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nStartups creating world leading Intellectual Property with Romanian and broader Eastern European foundersWhat’s your latest, most exciting investment?Uniapply.comWhat are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nStrong committed founders with deep understanding of the domain they are planning to disrupt on a global scale through innovative intellectual property.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nI think too many people are trying to launch platforms without much understanding of how hard it is to launch it in the absence of a major differentiator. Customer acquisition through other digital marketing platforms is very expensive if there is no other unfair advantage to launch such a platform.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nWe are very focused on Romanian founders — but they can reside and launch anywhere in the world. We have investments in many US-based companies started by Romanian founders.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nI think Romania is very well positioned to win in cybersecurity and enterprise software as well as AI-based engines. I am very excited about pentest-tools.com, deepstash.com, uniapply.com from our portfolio as well as Fintech OS and TypingDNA that are not in our portfolio.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nBucharest is a thriving ecosystem with plenty of opportunities ripe for global expansion.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nIndeed we have seen a surge in founders from smaller cities in Romania. We are founding partners of the Innovation Labs pre-accelerator that has a nationwide footprint and we are seeing more and more students interested in becoming founders all over Romania.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nMobility solutions are impacted, local players are losing to bigger players like Lime.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nThe pandemics delayed a lot of the investments, but we closed them toward the end of the year. Biggest worries for founders is that they have less and less leverage as a startup to attract tech talent. The problem is that the tech people can now work for any company in the world and this skyrocketed their salaries/rates.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes we have seen — some of them benefited from people staying at home and having more time.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nThe introduction of the vaccine and the pace at which people are vaccinated in Romania, that is not the fastest but also not the slowest either. An online platform for appointments is up and running and people are using it!Bogdan Axinia, Managing partner, eMAG VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nHealth & wellbeing are areas that “helped” by the pandemic crisis are on brink of transformation and growth. A blend of software and hardware readiness is developing fast together with the openness of clients and regulatory authorities.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nFood delivery services. It is still day 0 with great opportunities ahead in terms of consumer services and business growth: food, ready to cook meals, convenience items, grocery, etc.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nIt is still room to grow on B2C and B2B2C fintech space despite relatively high numbers of startups.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nBucharest and Romania in general have great potential when we look at talent pool from tech perspective and are a great place to start to scale regional and globally.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nGreat place to come: great infrastructure (internet cost & speed, number of hubs), talent pool and increased number of investments transactions in last 3 years.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nI expect to see a growth but not a surge of founders from other geographies. And I believe thats a good thing for the ecosystem.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nTravel is both exposed and in the same time with great potential for new startups to come. There will be a “revenge travel” period from consumers but they will look for something different and in the same time business travel will not be the same and this will generate new practices and behaviour.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nWe see opportunities to grow and we are allocating more capital for investments and we are advising our startups to invest more and grow faster.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nThe start of the vaccine campaign across the globe and the initial results.Dan Mihaescu, Founding partner, GapMinder VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nB2B platforms enabled by ML/automation/AI in fintech, SaaS enterprise software, cybersecurity, healthcare IT, low-code development environments, conversational technologies, automation in logisticsWhat’s your latest, most exciting investment?\n– Latest investment was DruidAI, announced on January 12th, 2021. GapMinder led a $2.5M round.\n– Other 2020 exciting new investments or follow-ons: TypingDNA, FintechOS, DeepStash, Soleadify, Machinations, Innoship, Frisbo, Cartloop, XVisionWhat are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\n– Stage: Seed or Series A\n– Technology: Automation or conversational technology assisted by ML or AI\n– Team: Mature with track-record for International expansion;\n– Product: B2B scalable international, with B2B platforms as main focusWhich areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nCopies of B2C models (from US) that are borne in CEE tend to be limited to small local markets, and evolve into highly crowded environments. Shared economy companies borne in Romania are such examples. Unit economics were simply not attractive for us as VC investor.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nMore than 70%Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\n– Models we consider will continue to thrive: B2B platforms enabled by automation/conversational technologies (assisted by ML/AI) have a higher potential for internationalisation vs B2C models.\n– Reg verticals with higher potential, we mentioned above a few.\n– GapMinder portfolio exciting companies: FintechOS, TypingDNA, DeepStash, DruidAI, Soleadify, Machinations, Innoship, Frisbo, Cartloop, SmartDreamers, XVision, among othersHow should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nRomania (in cities such as Bucharest, Cluj, Timisoara, Brasov, Oradea and Iasi) is a high-opportunity market, with excellent teams, startups borne with international vision, excellent environment for automation and ML enabled projects.The ecosystem becomes more mature, from coverage of pre-seed rounds towards Series A, while not overcrowded yet.\nOverall, a high opportunity environment for Series B and late Series A investors from US or rest of Europe.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nThe hubs are concentrated in terms of education pool, potential customers (B2B or more sophisticated B2C) to test new products, potential investors on the pre-seed phase that are crucial for the initial steps of start-up developments.For more advanced start-ups, hyper-growth is important, therefore the capability to scale up and go international might be helped by the presence in certain hubs.\nIn other words, there is a complex mix that the hubs are offering. So, at Romanian level, we do not expect a diminishing role of the hubs.At European or US level, it is debatable if main hubs are too overcrowded or over-expensive for the teams. However, the business growth potential for the more advanced start-ups is important.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nThe behaviour of users, both internal and external, has migrated towards a need for autonomy, which drives the need for:\n– Tools that allow conversational interactions (including in natural language) with evolved human like feeling\n– Remote collaborative low code development tools\n– A general need for all companies (from the smallest ones to enterprise) to move yesterday to digital interactionsIn 2020 a lot of consumers and companies were forced to focus on core priorities, and move to secondary focus the “nice-to-have” services or products. The VCs have seen even a sharper delimitation between high-tech and tech-enabled companies, not to mention some “interesting” proofs of Fake Tech. This shift has impacted lots of verticals, and such shift might be here to stay.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nGapMinder’s strategy described above is focussed on companies that actually have been benefiting from the tide of urgency in accelerating digital transformations of companies. And we seen it in the 2x-3x growth of most of our portfolio companies in 2020.\nOur advices to our portfolio companies have been simple:\n1. Cash is king. Make sure you have an 18 months minimum runway. If an opportunity to raise, seriously consider it.\n2. Customers are the most important partners you have. Listen to them\n3. The team is your most important asset. Keep it close and take care of it in these daring times.\n4. Act fastOf course, on top of the above, we had very specific conversations with each team.To be candid, this all looks good at the end of 2020, but the first half of 2020 has been intense for founders in our portfolio and filled with doubts about decisional freeze in some verticals, stress on implementation in international markets wherever travel was needed, alignment between teams inside larger companies. Looking back, this was just normal. We feel fortunate to be part of the life of such great teams and start-ups, that proved so good during tough times.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes, we already felt signs of recovery in second half of 2020, especially Q4.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nStarting at scale the vaccination against COVID-19 in last 6 weeks is definitely the most important positive sign at human level, society level, but also from a pure business perspective.\nIn our team, GapMinder, we feel optimistic!Alexandru Popescu, Managing Partner, Cleverage InvestmentWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nHealthTechWhat’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nOncochainAre there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t?

What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nOur investment strategy remains unchanged, the most commons worries of founders in our portfolio are linked to attracting new funding partners, lack of foresight in some target markets and difficulty in finding employees in certain verticals. We don’t have a general advice for all our startups, it’s case by case, we advise some to pivot, others to start conversion efforts on their large customer base and others to launch in new geographies.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYesWhat is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so?

https://t.co/Wjrz9j0lVj,2021-01-22T15:35:39,How VCs invested in Asia and Europe in 2020,"['Wrapping our look at how the venture capital asset class invested in 2020, today we’re taking a peek at Europe’s impressive year, and Asia’s slightly less invigorating set of results. (We’re speaking soon with folks who may have data on African VC activity in 2020; if those bear out, we’ll do a final entry in our series concerning the continent.)After digging into the United States’ broader venture capital results from last year with an extra eye on fintech and unicorn investing, at least one trend was clear: Venture capital is getting later and larger (as expected).Record dollar amounts were being invested, but across falling deal volume. More money and fewer rounds meant larger rounds, often going to the late and super-late stage startups in the market.Unicorns are feasting, in other words, while some younger startups struggle to raise capital.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.There have been some encouraging signs of seed activity, mind, but full-year data made it clear that in America, the more mature startups had the best of it.But what about the rest of the world? After parsing KPMG data concerning both how VCs invested in Europe (here) and Asia (here) last year, there are clear echoes. But not entire reproductions.Let’s discuss key data points from the two reports. This will be illustrative, brief and painless. Into the data!European VCs: Rich, but not evenly distributedCompared to historical investment levels, KPMG’s European VC report describes a venture capital scene at its peak. Q4 2020 saw $14.3 billion invested into EU startups across 1,192 deals, the highest dollar amount charted and a modest besting of the previous record set in Q3 2020.However, despite impressive investment totals, the number of deals that the money was spread over proved lackluster.The Q4 2020 deal count was the lowest on record since the continent’s deal peak in Q1 2019. Squinting at the provided chart, it appears that deal volume in Europe has fallen from around 2,200 in that peak quarter, to Q4’s fewer than 1,200 deals.']",Dr. Timnit Gebru,"['Nigel Sussman', 'African VC', 'Unicorns', 'Exchange', 'Exchange', 'KPMG', 'KPMG’s', 'EU', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAsiaEuropeFundings & ExitsStartupsTCVenture', 'Alex Wilhelm4:35 PM GMT+1•January 22', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/DzIvkg5w2Y,2021-01-23T21:00:22,How VCs and founders see 2021 differently,"['Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on\xa0the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Click\xa0here\xa0if you want it in your inbox every Saturday morning.Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.We’re shaking things up this weekend in the newsletter, focusing on a series of larger themes and news items instead of having a few discrete sections. Why? Because there was too much to fit into our usual format. If you were a fan of the original layout, we’ll be back to it next week.Today we’re talking Coinbase’s growth, how Juked.gg tapped the equity crowdfunding market, a noodle or two on the a16z media game, Talkspace’s SPAC, VC and founder predictions for 2021, and where’s the right place to found a company.Sound good? Let’s get into it!Coinbase’s deposits scale ahead of IPOThanks to Kazim Rizvi of Drop, parent company to Cardify which provides data on consumer spending, we have a look into how quickly deposits have scaled at American cryptocurrency platform Coinbase. As Coinbase has filed to go public, and we’re eagerly anticipating its eventual S-1 filing, we were stoked to get a directional look at how quickly consumer interest was growing for the assets it helps folks buy.They are scaling rapidly. Using the first week of January 2019 as a baseline, by the last week of December 2020 deposits and withdrawals from Coinbase had grown by more than 12x apiece. That’s staggering growth, and while the data is somewhat volatile — and we’d treat it as directional instead of exact — on a week-to-week basis, it underscores how well companies like Coinbase may be performing as Bitcoin booms once again, bringing in more trading interest and consumer demand.Via Cardify, Cardify data.The Cardify data also indicates a multiplying of new customer acquisition at Coinbase over the same time period, and deposits scaling alongside the price of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin has topped the $30,000 mark recently, sharply higher than in recent quarters, the price gains may have helped Coinbase not only a solid Q4 2020, but perhaps put it on a path for a bonkers Q1 2021 as well.If we were 10/10 excited about the Coinbase S-1 before this dataset, we’re now a heckin’ 12/10.Equity crowdfunding seven-figures for esports contentEsports is super cool and if you don’t agree, you are incorrect. But it doesn’t matter if you or I are right or not on the question, as the market has largely decided that competitive gaming is worth time, attention and investors’ money.The proliferation of esports leagues and games and the like has led to a decidedly fragmented universe, however, lacking a central hub akin to what ESPN provides the world of traditional sports.But not to worry, Juked.gg just raised capital to build a content hub for esports. This means that old folks like myself can still find out when tournaments are happening, and enjoy a dabble of League of Legends or Starcraft 2 pro play when we can, sans hunting around the internet for dates and times.Juked.gg went through 500 Startups (more on its class here), catching our eye at the time as a neat nexus for esports-related content. Now flush with a little over $1 million that it raised on the Republic platform, it has big plans.The Exchange spoke with Juked.gg’s co-founder and CEO Ben Goldhaber about his company’s performance to date. Per Goldhaber, Juked has scaled from 500 users when it launched in late 2019, to 50,000 in December of 2020. Ahead, Juked may invest more in journalism, more into social features, and more into user-generated content. We’ll have more on Juked as it gets its vision built, now powered by over a million dollars from 2,524 investors, each betting that the startup is building the right product to help unify a growing, if distributed, entertainment category.The a16z media pushTo preserve our collective sanity, I’m not going to bang on at length here, but building out content at a VC firm is not new. Hell, how long ago did the First Round Review launch? What a16z appears to have in mind is different in scale, not substance. We chatted about it on Equity this week, in case you need more on the matter.Talkspace’s maybe-not-stupid SPACWhile it is enjoyable to mock SPACs, featuring as many do companies that are nascent to say the least, not all SPAC-led debuts are as silly as the rest. This is the case with the impending Talkspace deal, the deck for which you can read here.What matters is this set of charts:Look at that! Historical revenue growth! Improving gross margins! Rising gross profit!You may argue that the company is not really worth an enterprise value of $1.4 billion that it will sport after its combination with Hudson Executive Investment Corp., but, hey, at least it’s a real business.How VCs and founders see 2021 differentlySeed VC NFX dropped a VC and founder survey the other day that I’ve been meaning to share with you. You can read the whole thing here, if you’d like.I have two pull-outs for you this morning:VCs are more bullish on the economy than founders, with around 30% of founders expecting consumer spending to stay flat or decline, positions that only around 17% of VCs agreed with.And when it comes to leaving the Bay Area — yes, that chestnut again — 35% of founders have itchy feet, while just 20% of investors are similarly inclined. I think this is because the latter have houses in the Bay Area while most founders do not. But it should temper the view that all the money and talent are leaving. They aren’t.There’s no place like no placeInitialized Capital put together some data on where founders think it is best to found a company. In 2020, nearly 42% of surveyed founders said the Bay Area. By 2021 that number had slipped to a little over 28%, with a plurality of 42% indicating that a distributed company is the best way to go.I hear about this a lot from early-stage founders. They are often building what I call micro-multinationals, small companies that have a few employees in one country, and then a handful in others. Making that setup work is going to be a hotspot for HR software I reckon.Regardless, the requirement of founding companies in the Bay Area is kaput. The advantages of founding there will linger much longer.Coming up!Coming up on The Exchange next week: The first entries of our new $50 million ARR series, featuring interviews with Assembly, SimpleNexus, Picsart, OwnBackup and others. And we have some $100 million ARR interviews in the can, as well.Finally, to keep the The Powers That Be happy, The Exchange covered some neat stuff this week, including American VC results, fintech and unicorn venture capital, European and Asian venture capital results, how the IPO market is even more bonkers than you thought, and notes on what Qualtrics may be worth when it goes public.Hugs, and let’s all get a nap in,Alex']",sign up,"['NavigationClose', 'Nigel Sussman', 'The TechCrunch Exchange', 'Ready', 'Talkspace’s SPAC', 'VC', 'IPOThanks to Kazim Rizvi', 'Drop', 'Cardify', 'Coinbase', 'Bitcoin', 'Via Cardify', 'Cardify', 'Cardify', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'the Coinbase S-1', 'ESPN', 'Exchange', 'Ben Goldhaber', 'VC', 'the First Round Review', 'Talkspace’s', 'SPACWhile', 'Talkspace', 'Hudson Executive Investment Corp.', 'VC NFX', 'VC', 'Exchange', 'ARR', 'Assembly', 'SimpleNexus', 'Picsart', 'OwnBackup', 'ARR', 'American VC', 'Qualtrics', 'AlexclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings &', 'ExchangeThe', 'The TechCrunch Exchange', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Meanwhile, Instacart is making some changes to its platform that will result in job loss.\xa0Sign up below to get this in your email every Friday at 1 p.m. PT.GitHub’s head of HR resigns; company offers fired Jewish employee his job backA GitHub internal investigation revealed the company made “significant errors of judgment and procedure” in the firing of the Jewish employee who cautioned his co-workers about the presence of Nazis in the D.C. area on the day of insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.In a blog post, GitHub COO Erica Brescia said the company’s head of HR took full responsibility for what happened and resigned from the company yesterday. GitHub did not disclose the name of the person who resigned, but it’s widely known that Carrie Olesen was the chief human resources officer at GitHub.GitHub’s head of HR resigns in light of termination of Jewish employeeGitHub said it has “reversed the decision to separate with the employee” and is talking to his representative.“To the employee we wish to say publicly: We sincerely apologize,” Brescia said in the blog post. However, the terminated employee previously told me that he did not want his job back but instead some other form of reconciliation.Google AI ethicist under investigation\xa0Google is investigating AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell for reportedly using automated scripts to find examples of mistreatment of Dr. Timnit Gebru, according to Axios. Gebru says she was fired from Google while Google has maintained that she resigned. In a statement to Axios, Google said the company had locked Mitchell’s account:Our security systems automatically lock an employee’s corporate account when they detect that the account is at risk of compromise due to credential problems or when an automated rule involving the handling of sensitive data has been triggered. In this instance, yesterday our systems detected that an account had exfiltrated thousands of files and shared them with multiple external accounts. We explained this to the employee earlier today.The recently formed Alphabet Workers Union made a statement saying it was concerned by Mitchell’s suspension of corporate access:“Regardless of the outcome of the company’s investigation, the ongoing targeting of leaders in this organization calls into question Google’s commitment to ethics—in AI and in their business practices. Many members of the Ethical AI team are AWU members and the membership of our union recognizes the crucial work that they do and stands in solidarity with them in this moment.”Google’s Sundar Pichai to meet with HBCU leadersAt least five HBCU presidents are scheduled to meet with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Chief Diversity Officer Melonie Parker later this month to discuss recent allegations of racism and discrimination at the company, according to CNN. Additionally, the goal of the meeting is to ensure HBCUs have a good relationship with Google and that the company offers a good environment for its students and graduates.Context: I'm finna tell yall why @Google  fired me- their MOST successful diversity recruiter in the history of their company- with the receipts to support that statement.— Real Abril (@RealAbril) December 21, 2020Amazon launches anti-union websiteAhead of Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama gearing up to vote on whether to form a union, Amazon launched an anti-union website.

https://t.co/Z760lkdOGy,2021-01-23T20:26:31,Augmented reality’s awkward phase will be long and painful,"['Howdy friends, this is the web version of my Week in Review newsletter, it’s here to entice you to sign up and get it in your inbox every week.Last week, I showcased how Twitter was looking at the future of the web with a decentralized approach so that they wouldn’t be stuck unilaterally de-platforming the next world leader. This week, I scribbled some thoughts on another aspect of the future web, the ongoing battle between Facebook and Apple to own augmented reality. Releasing the hardware will only be the start of a very messy transition from smartphone-first to glasses-first mobile computing.Again, if you so desire you can get this in your inbox from the newsletter page, and follow my tweets @lucasmtnyThe Big ThingIf the last few years of new “reality” tech has telegraphed anything, it’s that tech companies won’t be able to skip past augmented reality’s awkward phase, they’re going to have to barrel through it and it’s probably going to take a long-ass time.The clearest reality is that in 2021 everyday users still don’t seem quite as interested in AR as the next generation of platform owners stand to benefit from a massive transition. There’s some element of skating to where the puck is going among the soothsayers that believe AR is the inevitable platform heir etc. etc., but the battle to reinvent mobile is at its core a battle to kill the smartphone before its time has come.A war to remake mobile in the winner’s imageIt’s fitting that the primary backers of this AR future are Apple and Facebook, ambitious companies that are deeply in touch with the opportunities they could’ve capitalized on if they could do it all over again.While Apple and Facebook both have thousands of employees toiling quietly in the background building out their AR tech moats, we’ve seen and heard much more on Facebook’s efforts. The company has already served up several iterations of their VR hardware through Oculus and has discussed publicly over the years how they view virtual reality and augmented reality hardware converging.\xa0Facebook’s hardware and software experiments have been experimentations in plain sight, an advantage afforded to a company that didn’t sell any hardware before they started selling VR headsets. Meanwhile Apple has offered up a developer platform and a few well-timed keynote slots for developers harnessing their tools, but the most ambitious first-party AR project they’ve launched publicly on iOS has been a measuring tape app. Everything else has taken place behind closed doors.That secrecy tends to make any reporting on Apple’s plans particularly juicy. This week, a story from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman highlights some of Apple’s next steps towards a long-rumored AR glasses product, reporting that Apple plans to release a high-end niche VR device with some AR capabilities as early as next year. It’s not the most surprising but showcases how desperate today’s mobile kingpins are to ease the introduction of a technology that has the potential to turn existing tech stacks and the broader web on their heads.Apple said to be working a high-priced standalone VR headset as debut mixed reality productBoth Facebook and Apple have a handful of problems getting AR products out into the world, and they’re not exactly low-key issues:hardware isn’t readyplatforms aren’t readydevelopers aren’t readyusers don’t want it yetThis is a daunting wall, but isn’t uncommon among hardware moonshots. Facebook has already worked its way through this cycle once with virtual reality over several generations of hardware, though there were some key difference and few would call VR a mainstream success quite yet.Nevertheless, there’s a distinct advantage to tackling VR before AR for both Facebook and Apple, they can invest in hardware that’s adjacent to the technologies their AR products will need to capitalize on, they can entice developers to build for a platform that’s more similar to what’s coming and they can set base line expectations for consumers for a more immersive platform. At least this would all be the case for Apple with a mass market VR device closer to Facebook’s $300 Quest 2, but a pricey niche device as Gurman’s report details doesn’t seem to fit that bill quite so cleanly.The AR/VR content problem\xa0The scenario I’d imagine both Facebook and Apple are losing sleep over is that they release serviceable AR hardware into a world where they are wholly responsible for coming up with all the primary use cases.The AR/VR world already has a hefty backlog of burnt developers who might be long-term bullish on the tech but are also tired of getting whipped around by companies that seem to view the development of content ecosystems simply as a means to ship their next device. If Apple is truly expecting the sales numbers of this device that Bloomberg suggests — similar to Valve’s early Index headset sales — then color me doubtful that there will be much developer interest at all in building for a stopgap device, I’d expect ports of Quest 2 content and a few shining stars from Apple-funded partners.I don’t think this will me much of a shortcut for them.True AR hardware is likely going to have different standards of input, different standards of interaction and a much different approach to use cases compared to a device built for the home or smartphone.\xa0Apple has already taken every available chance to entice mobile developers to embrace phone-based AR on iPhones through ARKit, a push they have seemed to back off from at recent developer-centric events. As someone who has kept a close eye on early projects, I’d say that most players in the space have been very underwhelmed by what existing platforms enable and what has been produced widely.That’s really not great for Apple or Facebook and suggests that both of these companies are going to have to guide users and developers through use cases they design. I think there’s a convincing argument that early AR glasses applications will be dominated by first-party tech and may eschew full third-party native apps in favor of tightly controlled data integrations more similar to how Apple has approached developer integrations inside Siri.But giving developers a platform built with Apple or Facebook’s own dominance in mind is going to be tough to sell, underscoring the fact that mobile and mobile AR are going to be platforms that will have to live alongside each other for quite a bit. There will be rich opportunities for developers to create experiences that play with 3D and space, but there are also plenty of reasons to expect they’ll be more resistant to move off of a mutually enriching mobile platform onto one where Facebook or Apple will have the pioneer’s pick of platform advantages. What’s in it for them?Mobile’s OS-level winners captured plenty of value from top-of-funnel apps marketplaces, but the down-stream opportunities found mobile’s true prize, a vastly expanded market for digital ads. With the opportunity of a mobile do-over, expect to find pioneering tech giants pitching proprietary digital ad infrastructure for their devices. Advertising will likely be augmented reality’s greatest opportunity allowing the digital ads market to create an infinite global canvas for geo-targeted customized ad content. A boring future, yes, but a predictable one.For Facebook, being a platform owner in the 2020s means getting to set their own limitations on use cases, not being confined by App Store regulations and designing hardware with social integrations closer to the silicon. For Apple, reinventing the mobile OS in the 2020s likely means an opportunity to more meaningfully dominate mobile advertising.It’s a do-over to the tune of trillions in potential revenues.What comes nextThe AR/VR industry has been stuck in a cycle of seeking out saviors. Facebook has been the dearest friend to proponents after startup after startup has failed to find a speedy win. Apple’s long-awaited AR glasses are probably where most die-hards are currently placing their faith.I don’t think there are any misgivings from Apple or Facebook in terms of what a wild opportunity this is to win, it’s why they each have more people working on this than any other future-minded project. AR will probably be massive and change the web in a fundamental way, a true Web 3.0 that’s the biggest shift of the internet to date.That’s doesn’t sound like something that will happen particularly smoothly.I’m sure that these early devices will arrive later than we expect, do less than we expect and that things will be more and less different from the smartphone era’s mobile paradigms in ways we don’t anticipate. I’m also sure that it’s going to be tough for these companies to strong-arm themselves into a more seamless transition. This is going to be a very messy for tech platforms and is a transition that won’t happen overnight, not by a long shot.Other thingsThe Loon is dead\nOne of tech’s stranger moonshots is dead, as Google announced this week that Loon, it’s internet balloon project is being shut down. It was an ambitious attempt to bring high-speed internet to remote corners of the world, but the team says it wasn’t sustainable to provide a high-cost service at a low price. MoreFacebook Oversight Board tasked with Trump removal\nI talked a couple weeks ago — what feels like a lifetime ago — about how Facebook’s temporary ban of Trump was going to be a nightmare for the company. I wasn’t sure how they’d stall for more time of a banned Trump before he made Facebook and Instagram his central platform, but they made a brilliant move, purposefully tying the case up in PR-favorable bureaucracy, tossing the case to their independent Oversight Board for their biggest case to date. MoreJack is Back\nAlibaba’s head honcho is back in action. Alibaba shares jumped this week when the Chinese e-commerce giant’s billionaire CEO Jack Ma reappeared in public after more than three months after his last public appearance, something that stoked plenty of conspiracies. Where he was during all this time isn’t clear, but I sort of doubt we’ll be finding out. MoreTrump pardons Anthony Levandowski\nTrump is no longer President, but in one of his final acts, he surprisingly opted to grant a full pardon to one Anthony Levandowski, the former Google engineer convicted of stealing trade secrets regarding their self-driving car program. It was a surprising end to one of the more dramatic big tech lawsuits in recent years. MoreXbox raises Live prices [Update: Maybe not]\nI’m not sure how this stacks in importance relative to what else is listed here, but I’m personally pissed that Microsoft is hiking the price of their streaming subscription Xbox Live Gold. It’s no secret that the gaming industry is embracing a subscription economy, it will be interesting to see what the divide looks like in terms of gamer dollars going towards platform owners versus studios. \xa0MoreMusk offers up $100M donation to carbon capture tech\nElon Musk, who is currently the world’s richest person, tweeted out this week that he will be donating $100 million towards a contest to build the best technology for carbon capture.

https://t.co/WXTDZl5ilM,2021-01-22T20:02:00,Drupal’s journey from dorm-room project to billion-dollar exit,"[""Twenty years ago Drupal and Acquia founder Dries Buytaert was a college student at the University of Antwerp. He wanted to put his burgeoning programming skills to work by building a communications tool for his dorm. That simple idea evolved over time into the open-source Drupal web content management system, and eventually a commercial company called Acquia built on top of it.Buytaert would later raise over $180 million and exit in 2019 when the company was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $1 billion, but it took 18 years of hard work to reach that point. \n\t\t\tWhen Drupal came along in the early 2000s, it wasn’t the only open-source option, but it was part of a major movement toward giving companies options by democratizing web content management.\t\t\t\t\tMany startups are built on open source today, but back in the early 2000s, there were only a few trail blazers and none that had taken the path that Acquia took. Buytaert and his co-founders decided to reduce the complexity of configuring a Drupal installation by building a hosted cloud service.That seems like a no-brainer now, but consider at the time in 2009, AWS was still a fledgling side project at Amazon, not the $45 billion behemoth it is today. In 2021, building a startup on top of an open-source project with a SaaS version is a proven and common strategy. Back then nobody else had done it. As it turned out, taking the path less traveled worked out well for Acquia.Moving from dorm room to billion-dollar exit is the dream of every startup founder. Buytaert got there by being bold, working hard and thinking big. His story is compelling, but it also offers lessons for startup founders who also want to build something big.Born in the proverbial dorm roomIn the days before everyone had internet access and a phone in their pockets, Buytaert simply wanted to build a way for him and his friends to communicate in a centralized way. “I wanted to build kind of an internal message board really to communicate with the other people in the dorm, and it was literally talking about things like ‘Hey, let’s grab a drink at 8:00,'” Buytaert told me.He also wanted to hone his programming skills. “At the same time I wanted to learn about PHP and MySQL, which at the time were emerging technologies, and so I figured I would spend a few evenings putting together a basic message board using PHP and MySQL, so that I could learn about these technologies, and then actually have something that we could use.”The resulting product served its purpose well, but when graduation beckoned, Buytaert realized if he unplugged his PC and moved on, the community he had built would die. At that point, he decided to move the site to the public internet and named it drop.org, which was actually an accident. Originally, he meant to register dorp.org because “dorp” is Dutch for “village or small community,” but he mistakenly inverted the letters during registration.Buytaert continued adding features to drop.org like diaries (a precursor to blogging) and RSS feeds. Eventually, he came up with the idea of open-sourcing the software that ran the site, calling it Drupal.The birth of web content managementAbout the same time Buytaert was developing the basis of what would become Drupal, web content management (WCM) was a fresh market. Early websites had been fairly simple and straightforward, but they were growing more complex in the late 90s and a bunch of startups were trying to solve the problem of managing them. Buytaert likely didn’t know it, but there was an industry waiting for an open-source tool like Drupal.""]",the weekly TechCrunch series,"['Miller@ron_miller / 9:02 PM GMT+1•January 22', 'Acquia', 'Dries Buytaert', 'the University of Antwerp', 'Acquia', 'Vista Equity Partners', 'Acquia', 'Amazon', 'SaaS', 'Acquia', 'Buytaert', 'PHP', 'PHP', 'RSS', 'Buytaert', 'WCM', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsCloudEnterpriseFundings & ExitsM&ASaaSTCAcquiadries', 'Dries Buytaert', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/XWJmkBlCZp,2021-01-23T19:00:07,Work trips are making a $5 billion comeback,"['Would you bet millions of dollars on a corporate travel comeback? Doesn’t matter. Andreessen Horowitz, Addition and Elad Gil are anyways.This week, the trio led a nine-figure financing round in TripActions, a software company that helps other companies book and manage corporate travel. But the news is (always) more than the number. I see TripActions’ growth as a signal to travel sector startups, which faced the brunt of the pandemic’s impact. We’ve heard the market is emerging again, but the fact that investors poured money into an up-round valued at $5 billion adds an extra layer of conviction.TripActions, like many travel startups, laid off hundreds of employees in the beginning of the pandemic as the coronavirus froze business travel. It still hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels, but a spokesperson for the company said that a more distributed working class could boost corporate travels. If you don’t have to commute every day, maybe you don’t mind hopping on a flight once a month instead.Here’s why this could be good news: Distributed work and corporate travel aren’t mutually exclusive categories. For founders in the remote work space, this is key wiggle room to consider as we wait for post-pandemic consumer behavior to be colored in. So often, founders pitch that their startup is remote-or-bust, and while that might make a good headline, it’s clear that everyone will come out of this time with a different mindset.Read on, as we discuss Plaid’s new investment in early-stage founders, Israel’s startup ecosystem, and telehealth in two different ways.

Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a\xa0combined $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors poured\xa0$73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.This week, we’re looking into how President Biden’s inauguration impacted news apps, the latest in the Parler lawsuit, and how TikTok’s app continues to shape culture, among other things.Top StoriesJudge says Amazon doesn’t have to host Parler on AWSLogos for AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Parler. Image Credits: TechCrunchU.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein in Seattle this week ruled that Amazon won’t be required to restore access to web services to Parler. As you may recall, Parler sued Amazon for booting it from AWS’ infrastructure, effectively forcing it offline. Like Apple and Google before it, Amazon had decided that the calls for violence that were being spread on Parler violated its terms of service. It also said that Parler showed an “unwillingness and inability” to remove dangerous posts that called for the rape, torture and assassination of politicians, tech executives and many others, the AP reported.Judge denies Parler’s bid to make Amazon restore serviceAmazon’s decision shouldn’t have been a surprise for Parler. Amazon had reported 98 examples of Parler posts that incited violence over the past several weeks before its decision. It told Parler these were clear violations of the terms of service.Parler’s lawsuit against Amazon, however, went on to claim breach of contract and even made antitrust allegations.The judge shot down Parler’s claims that Amazon and Twitter were colluding over the decision to kick the app off AWS. Parler’s claims over breach of contract were denied, too, as the contract had never said Amazon had to give Parler 30 days to fix things. (Not to mention the fact that Parler breached the contract on its side, too.) It also said Parler had fallen short in demonstrating the need for an injunction to restore access to Amazon’s web services.The ruling only blocks Parler from forcing Amazon to again host it as the lawsuit proceeds, but is not the final ruling in the overall case, which is continuing.TikTok drives another pop song to No. 1 on Billboard charts, breaks Spotify’s recordWe already knew TikTok was playing a large role in influencing music charts and listening behavior. For example, Billboard last year noted how TikTok drove hits from Sony artists like Doja Cat (“Say So”) and 24kGoldn (“Mood”), and helped Sony discover new talent. Columbia also signed viral TikTok artists like Lil Nas X, Powfu, StaySolidRocky, Jawsh 685, Arizona Zervas and 24kGoldn. Meanwhile, Nielsen has said that no other app had helped break more songs in 2020 than TikTok.This month, we’ve witnessed yet another example of this phenomenon. Olivia Rodrigo, the 17-year-old star of Disney+’s “High School Musical: The Musical: the Series” released her latest song, “Drivers License” on January 8. The pop ballad and breakup anthem is believed to be referencing the actress’ relationship with co-star Joshua Bassett, which gave the song even more appeal to fans.Upon its release the song was heavily streamed by TikTok users, which helped make it an overnight sensation of sorts. According to a report by The WSJ, Billboard counted 76.1 million streams and 38,000 downloads in the U.S. during the week of its release. It also made a historic debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100, becoming the first smash hit of 2021.On January 11, “Drivers License” broke Spotify’s record for most streams per day (for a non-holiday song) with 15.17 million global streams. On TikTok, meanwhile, the number of videos featuring the song and the views they received doubled every day, The WSJ said.Charli D’Amelio’s dance to it on the app has now generated 5 million “Likes” across nearly 33 million views, as of the time of writing.Of course, other TikTok hits have broken out in the past, too — even reaching No. 1 like “Blinding Lights” (The Weeknd) and “Mood” (24kGoldn). But the success of “Drivers License” may be in part due to the way it focuses on a subject that’s more relevant to TikTok’s young, teenage user base. It talks about first loves and being dumped for the other girl. And its title and opening refer to a time many adults have forgotten: the momentous day when you get your driver’s license. It’s highly relatable to the TikTok crowd who fully embraced it and made it a hit.Weekly NewsPlatforms: AppleApple stops signing iOS 12.5, making iOS 12.5.1 the only versions of iOS available to older devices.A report claims Apple’s iOS 15 update will cut support for devices with an A9 chip, like the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s Plus and the original iPhone SE.New analysis estimates Apple’s upcoming iOS privacy changes will cause a roughly 7% revenue hit for Facebook in Q2.

However, iMessage support is more wonky, as the company actually ships you an old iPhone to make the connection to the network.

https://t.co/tz2Yw8pXdE,2021-01-23T14:11:02,"Watch SpaceX launch its first dedicated rideshare mission live, carrying a record-breaking number of satellites","['[UPDATE: Today’s attempt was scrubbed due to weather conditions. Another launch window is available tomorrow at 10 AM ET]SpaceX is set to launch the very first of its dedicated rideshare missions – an offering it introduced in 2019\xa0that allows small satellite operators to book a portion of a payload on a Falcon 9 launch. SpaceX’s rocket has a relatively high payload capacity compared to the size of many of the small satellites produced today, so a rideshare mission like this offers smaller companies and startups a chance to get their spacecraft in orbit without breaking the bank.The cargo capsule atop the Falcon 9 flying today holds a total of 133 satellites according to SpaceX, which is a new record for the highest number of satellites being launched on a single rocket – beating out a payload of 104 spacecraft delivered by Indian Space Research Organization’s PSLV-C37 launch back in February 2017. It’ll be a key demonstration not only of SpaceX’s rideshare capabilities, but also of the complex coordination involved in a launch that includes deployment of multiple payloads into different target orbits in relatively quick succession.SpaceX will now offer dedicated ‘rideshare’ launches for small satellitesThis launch will be closely watched in particular for its handling of orbital traffic management, since it definitely heralds what the future of private space launches could look like in terms of volume of activity. Some of the satellites flying on this mission are not much larger than an iPad, so industry experts will be paying close attention to how they’re deployed and tracked to avoid any potential conflicts.Some of the payloads being launched today include significant volumes of startup spacecraft, including 36 of Swarm’s tiny IoT network satellites, and eight of Kepler’s GEN-1 communications satellites. There are also 10 of SpaceX’s own Starlink satellites on board, and 48 of Planet Labs’ Earth-imaging spacecraft.The launch stream above should begin around 15 minutes prior to the mission start, which is set for 9:40 AM EST (6:40 AM PST) today.']",announced this morning,"['NavigationClose ScreenWatch', 'Falcon', 'Falcon', 'Indian Space Research Organization’s PSLV-C37', 'iPad', 'IoT', 'Kepler’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Etherington3:11', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/YVbfxelXx6,2021-01-23T07:00:11,How fintech and serial founders drove African pre-seed investing to new heights in 2020,"['When Stripe-subsidiary Paystack raised its seed round of $1.3 million in 2016, it was one of the largest disclosed rounds at that stage in Nigeria.\xa0At the time, seven-figure seed investments in African startups were a rarity. But over the years, those same seed-stage rounds have become more common, with some very early-stage startups even raising eight-figure sums. Nigerian fintech startup, Kuda, which bagged $10 million last year, comes to mind, for example.Also notable amidst the growth in seven and eight-figure African seed deals have been gains in pre-seed fundraising. Typically, pre-seed rounds are raised when the startup is still in the product development phase, yet to make revenue or discover product-market fit. These investments are usually made by third-party investors (friends and family), and range between $25,000-$150,000.But the narrative as to how much an early-stage African startup can raise as pre-seed has changed.\xa0Last year, African VCs who usually fund seed and Series A rounds began partaking in pre-seed rounds, and they don’t seem to be slowing down. Just a month into 2021,\xa0 Egyptian fintech startup Cassbana raised a $1 million pre-seed investment led by VC firm Disruptech in a bid to drive expansion within the country.Nigeria’s Kuda raises $10M to be the mobile-first challenger bank for AfricaSo why the sudden change in appetite from investors?Andreata Muforo is a partner at TLcom Capital, a pan-African early-stage VC firm. She told TechCrunch that last year’s run of 23 pre-seed rounds (10 of which were $150,000+ deals) per Briter Bridges data, was due to the confidence investors had in the market, especially fintech.Startups building financial infrastructure got noticedWhile most African pre-seed investments in 2020 went to fintech, there were exceptions, including Egyptian edtech startup Zedny, which raised $1.2 million; Nigerian automotive tech startup Autochek Africa, which raised $3.4 million; and Nigerian talent startup TalentQL, which raised $300,000.\xa0Just as Paystack and Flutterwave built payment infrastructure for thousands of African businesses, these fintech startups are trying to make their mark in the sweet spots of credit and banking.\xa0“Fintech is compelling. But while most fintech startups play around the commodities side of fintech, it’s the companies building infrastructure around the market that got most of the pre-seed validation last year,” Muforo said. Her firm, TLcom, led the $1 million pre-seed investment in Okra.Okra is an API fintech startup. So are Mono, OnePipe and Pngme. They are building Africa’s API infrastructure that connects bank accounts with financial institutions and third-party companies for different purposes. Within the past 18 months, Mono and Pngme raised $500,000, while OnePipe raised $950,000 in pre-seed.It is noteworthy that while these startups are clamoring to solve Africa’s open API banking issues, three of the four deals came after Visa’s $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid last year in January.Although the Visa-Plaid acquisition has now been called off, it is safe to say some African investors developed FOMO, handing out sizable checks to fund “Africa’s Plaid” in the process.Visa will not acquire Plaid after running into regulatory wallDigital lenders remain one of their most important customers for fintech API startups. They can access customers’ financial accounts to understand their spending patterns and know who to loan to.Egypt’s Shahry and Nigeria’s Evolve Credit are fintech startups building credit infrastructure for their markets. Evolve Credit connects digital lenders to those who need loan services in Nigeria via its online loan marketplace. Shahry, on the other hand, employs an AI-based credit scoring engine so users in Egypt can apply for credit. The pair also secured impressive pre-seed funding — Evolve Credit, $325,000, and Shahry, $650,000.A recurring theme: Serial foundersMuforo points out that aside from startups building fintech infrastructure, the caliber of founders was another reason pre-seed funding peaked last year.Adewale Yusuf, co-founder and CEO of TalentQL, a startup that hires, manages and outsources talent for Nigerian and global companies, seemed to agree. He told TechCrunch that trust between the VCs and founders involved played a major role in most pre-seed rounds last year.\xa0“It wasn’t surprising that a lot of investors put money in pre-seed rounds. I say this because we also saw existing founders and serial entrepreneurs coming back to the market. To me, these founders’ credibility was a major part of why those rounds were large,” he said.A second-time founder himself, Yusuf is the co-founder of Nigerian tech media publication Techpoint Africa. His partner at TalentQL, Opeyemi Awoyemi, is also a serial entrepreneur. He co-founded Ringier One Africa Media-owned Jobberman, one of Africa’s most popular recruitment platforms.According to Adedayo Amzat, founder of Zedcrest Capital, which is the lead investor in TalentQL’s round, the founders’ experience proved vital in closing the deal.\xa0He says investors are more comfortable backing experienced founders in pre-seed rounds because they have a more mature understanding of the problems they’re trying to solve. So, in essence, they tend to raise more capital.“If you look at pre-seed sizes, experienced founders can demand a significant premium over first-time founders,” Amzat said. “Pre-seed valuation cap for first-time founders will typically be between 400K to $1 million while we frequently see up to $5 million for experienced founders.”\xa0It was a recurring theme last year. Yele Bademosi, who runs Microtraction, a West African early-stage VC firm, is the CEO of Bundle Africa, a Nigerian-based crypto-exchange startup that raised $450,000 in April 2020.\xa0Shahry co-founders Sherif ElRakabawy and Mohamed Ewis also run Egypt’s largest shopping engine and price comparison website, Yaoota.Mono co-founder and CEO Abdulhamid Hassan was the co-founder of Nigerian fintech startup OyaPay and data science startup Voyance. Also, Etop Ikpe, the co-founder and CEO of Autochek Africa, was CEO of DealDey and Cars45.That said, Fara Ashiru Jituboh of Okra who launched a couple of ventures in the past, and Akan Nelson of Evolve Credit as a first-time founder got investments that most of their counterparts would only dream of. For Jituboh, her solid tech background also spoke for her — boasting a senior software engineering job at Pexels and engineering consultant role at Canva before founding Okra.“We backed Fara because she’s a strong tech founder. When you look at the core of what Okra does as a tech-heavy company, you see how important it was to make the decision,” Muforo said about backing Okra’s CEO and CTO.Nelson told TechCrunch that his finance background helped Evolve Credit raise its six-figure sum. The team’s bullishness on finding product-market fit and the potential of Africa’s loan marketplace was also enough to bring foreign and local VCs like Samurai Incubate, Future Africa, Ingressive Capital and Microtraction on board.While early-stage investments in African startups haven’t reached full speed, the explosion in the number of angel investors has lowered entry barriers into early-stage investing.\xa0Now investors are beginning to show readiness toward African startups that have promise as they continue to search for the next Paystack.\xa0“More people are willing to take risks now in the market, especially angel investors.

https://t.co/MVznQuQOIM,2021-01-22T19:38:54,Microsoft withdraws Xbox Live Gold price hike following uproar from users,"['Updated at 10:26PM PT, January 22: Microsoft is backtracking on the planned price hike of Xbox Live Gold, less than 24 hours after making the announcement as the gaming giant attempts to mend its relationship with fans.“We messed up today and you were right to let us know. Connecting and playing with friends is a vital part of gaming and we failed to meet the expectations of players who count on it every day. As a result, we have decided not to change Xbox Live Gold pricing,” the company wrote in a blog post.Microsoft said it is going a step further to make up with Xbox users. The company said free-to-play games on Xbox will no longer require an Xbox Live Gold subscription for online play. “We are working hard to deliver this change as soon as possible in the coming months,” the company wrote.Our original story from earlier Friday follows.————————————————In what feels like an attempt at kicking some bad news under the rug on a Friday, Microsoft announced this morning that the price of Xbox Live Gold is going up.Here’s how the price changes break down:The one-month plan is going from $10 per month to $11.The three-month plan is going from $25 to $30.The six-month plan is going from $40 to $60 — but only for new customers, says Microsoft.“But what about the twelve-month plan? Didn’t they used to offer those?”They did! It was $60 — or the price that a six-month subscription will go for now. They stopped selling twelve-month plans back in July of last year, presumably because this change was on the horizon and they would’ve had to acknowledge on the price tag that 12 months of Live Gold would cost $120.The good news: the price hike on the six-month plan only impacts new customers. If you’ve already got a six-month subscription (or are grandfathered into an auto-renewing twelve-month subscription), Xbox Support confirmed in a tweet that the price won’t increase:If you’re an existing online 12-month or 6-month Xbox Live Gold member, there’s no price change. If you choose to renew your membership, it will renew at your current price.https://t.co/wFJmElI5dH— Xbox Support (@XboxSupport) January 22, 2021If you’re on the one-month or three-month plans, though, it sounds like you’ll be paying the new price.So why bump the cost? Microsoft doesn’t officially outline their reasoning (beyond pointing out that they haven’t increased the price in years, or as long as a decade in some regions), but one can assume it’s at least partially to make the $15 a month Xbox Game Pass (which bundles Xbox Live Gold with a library of all-you-can-eat, on-demand titles) that much more alluring.Manish Singh contributed to this report.']",it’s shutting down Loon,"['Microsoft', 'NavigationClose ScreenMicrosoft', 'Kumparak@grg / 8:38', 'Darrell EtheringtonUpdated', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox Live Gold', 'Microsoft', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox Live Gold', 'Microsoft', '’ve', 'Xbox Support', 'Microsoft', 'Manish Singh', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox Live Gold', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/ATmQMkNSgi,2021-01-23T02:45:55,Could giant SPACs be next?,"['While many deemed 2020 the year of SPAC, short for special purpose acquisition company, 2021 may well make last year look quaint in comparison.It’s probably not premature to be asking: is there any company too big to be SPAC’d?Just today, we saw the trading debut of the most valuable company to date go public through a merger with one of these SPACs: 35-five-year-old, Pontiac, Michigan-based United Wholesale Mortgage, which is among the biggest mortgage companies in the U.S.Its shares slipped a bit by the end of trading, closing at $11.35 down from their starting price of $11.54, but it’s doubtful anyone involved is crying into their cocktails tonight. The outfit was valued at a whopping $16 billion when its merger with the blank-check outfit Gores Holdings IV was approved earlier this week.Why is this interesting? Well, first, despite UWM’s size, its path to going public took less than a year, beginning with Gores Holdings IV completing its IPO in late January 2020 and raising approximately $425 million in cash.Alec Gores, the billionaire founder of of the private equity firm Gores Group, led the deal. The tie-up was announced back in September and ultimately included an additional $500 million private placement. (It’s typical to tack-on these transactions once a target company has been identified and accepts the terms of the proposed merger. Most targets are many times larger than the blank check companies with which they are joining forces.)Also notable is that UWM is a mature company, one that says it generated $1.3 billion in revenue in the third quarter of last year alone and whose CEO, whose father started the company in 1986, said last fall that the company is “massively profitable.”It’s a story unlike that of most outfits to go public recently through the SPAC process. Consider Opendoor, Luminar Technologies, and Virgin Galactic. Each is still developing a business that needs capital to keep going and which might not have found much more funding from private market investors.SpaceX director Steve Jurvetson underscored the point pretty bluntly last week, saying, for example, that Virgin Galactic has seen “no positive business development” since being taken public. “They announced that they’re going to develop a hypersonic plane, but that has zero synergy with the current business they’re trying to launch, which is suborbital spaceflights, which have yet to happen for customers.”If more profitable, more mature, more businesses with a very clear path to future revenue — more companies like UMW — begin choosing SPACs over traditional IPOs, it could change widespread perceptions of SPAC candidates as businesses that had nowhere else to go.It could also broaden thinking about what size companies are appropriate to take public this way and lead to much bigger transactions.More certain: UWM isn’t likely to hold the record for ‘biggest SPAC deal ever’ for long. Not only is interest in SPACs as feverish as ever, but one vehicle in particular seems poised to take the title, and that’s the SPAC of billionaire investor William Ackman, whose blank-check company raised $4 billion last summer.Presumably, the deal will be a doozy. Reportedly, Ackerman was at one point looking to take public Airbnb with his SPAC. When Airbnb passed on the proposed merger, he reportedly reached out to the privately held media conglomerate Bloomberg. (Bloomberg has said it’s untrue.)Because SPACs typically complete a merger with a private company in two years or less, speculation has been running rampant about what Ackman — who plans to kick in an additional $1 billion in cash from his hedge fund — will piece together with all that money.In the meantime, there have been 67 new SPAC offerings in the last 22 days alone — as many as in all of 2019. They’ve raised $19.2 billion. And there’s seemingly no end to the fundraising in sight.Just this week, Fifth Wall Ventures, the four-year-old, L.A.-based proptech focused venture firm, registered plans to raise $250 million for a new blank-check company.Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak, who previously ran medical device giant Medtronic, was reported to be planning to raise between $750 million and $1 billion for a blank-check firm targeting deals in the health tech sector.As for Gores Group, on Wednesday, it registered plans to raise $400 million in an IPO for its newest blank-check company. It will be the outfit’s seventh SPAC to date.']",said,"['NavigationClose', 'Lawrence Anareta / Getty ImagesWhile', 'Pontiac', 'United Wholesale Mortgage', 'U.S.Its', 'Gores Holdings IV', 'UWM', 'Gores Holdings IV', 'Alec Gores', 'Gores Group', 'UWM', 'Luminar Technologies', 'Virgin Galactic', 'Steve Jurvetson', 'Virgin Galactic', 'UMW', 'UWM', 'William Ackman', 'Ackerman', 'Bloomberg', 'Ackman', 'Fifth Wall Ventures', 'Intel', 'Omar Ishrak', 'Medtronic', 'Gores Group', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Loizos3:45 AM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/WmIpIhX1yf,2021-01-22T21:55:53,The far right’s favorite registrar is building ‘censorship-resistant’ servers,"['“The digital divide is now a matter of life and death for people who are unable to access essential healthcare information,” said UN Secretary General António Guterres in June 2020. Almost half the global population currently has no internet access, and many who do cannot freely access all information sources.\xa0Freedom House, which tracks internet restrictions worldwide, says the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating a dramatic decline in global internet freedom. It found that governments in at least 28 countries censored websites and social media posts in 2020 to suppress unfavorable health statistics, corruption allegations and other COVID-19-related content.Now, U.S. company Toki is building “school-in-a-box” devices to connect up to 1 billion people across Africa and Asia, using technologies that it claims could filter content to avoid some information sources and bypass local censorship.\xa0The devices will be Wi-Fi-ready servers that run on electric power or batteries and can handle dozens of concurrent users. If no networks are available, the servers will also come pre-installed with digital libraries curated to provide “locally relevant content.”\xa0One of Toki’s country managers describes on LinkedIn that the devices would also run a decentralized search engine, designed to be anonymous, private and censorship-resistant. They will be donated to communities in the developing world by U.S.-based eRise, which was founded in 2019 to, according to its website, “focus on digital empowerment initiatives that are capital-efficient, and which improve access to content, community and commerce.”Both Toki and eRise were founded by entrepreneur and free speech advocate Rob Monster. Monster owns domain registration company Epik, which allowed controversial social network Parler to come briefly back online last week after the site was booted from Amazon’s cloud service. Parler is just one of several platforms enabled by Epik, and Monster’s other domain and web hosting companies, that have been home to far-right content. Parler is accused of hosting users that helped to coordinate the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6.\xa0Parler is officially offline after AWS suspensionThe “school-in-a-box” would contain a memory card with educational content, games, books, maps and modules related to prayers, the story of religions and “the art of being grateful.” It says the device is intended for “parents who want their kids to be smarter and curious; schools who can’t afford a computer; [and] religious places who wish to spread awareness about education and empower the society.”\xa0But one researcher says this effort recalls Facebook’s heavily criticized project offering free connectivity in India, which spawned accusations of bias and self-censorship.\xa0“We’ve seen a similar tactic by Facebook, to provide digital access points that can also serve the purpose of delivering favorable content and ensuring that these groups become dependent on your benevolence,” said Dr. Joan Donovan, director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at the Shorenstein Center. “It becomes that much harder later on to change the power dynamics when the ideology is in the infrastructure.”Monster has used free speech arguments to defend Epik’s working with platforms that either welcome or tolerate extreme content. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, has been reported as saying that Monster “offers services to the most disreputable horrific people on the Internet.”\xa0Epik spokesperson Rob Davis told TechCrunch that Epik actively works with its clients to help them moderate content, and claimed that the company has deplatformed Nazi groups and deleted those promoting genocide.“Lawful, responsible freedom of speech is an amazing right,” said Davis. “Every [domain registrar] has groups like this but Epik is often held to a higher standard.”In a series of posts in 2019 on a forum dedicated to domain-name trading, Monster provided more details about the Toki technology. The servers would be powered by cheap Raspberry Pi processors and run a proprietary version of Linux that would enable file sharing, peer-to-peer commerce, a digital wallet and a personalized search engine, with the option of “ignoring certain data sources.”\xa0Facebook addresses political controversy in India, monetization opportunities, startup investments“Decentralization not only means decentralization of the narrative and talking points of big tech groups like Google, Twitter and Facebook,” said Epik’s Davis. “It also means anti-censorship by empowering people with things that they didn’t know.” The spokesperson gave the example of naturopathic remedies for minor health complaints. Naturopathic remedies have not been proven to be effective against COVID-19.Eventually, each device might come pre-loaded with a “snapshot” of the internet, said Davis, although he did not describe how the internet might be reduced to fit on a single, small physical device. The eRise website notes that content would be curated by local digital librarians that it would recruit. Davis told TechCrunch that Toki has working models of its server, is already conducting field trials and hopes to start deploying the devices to 6,000 villages in Africa in 2022 or 2023, perhaps in collaboration with an unnamed Asian telecoms company.\xa0The Toki devices’ selectivity, if practical, could raise its own content and censorship concerns; for example, if eRise allowed extreme content similar to that seen on Epik’s clients like Gab and Parler, or ignored scientific advice on COVID-19 or other health issues.\xa0Donovan said she is wary of any one-box solution. “We have to focus on decoupling information companies from service providers,” she said. “That much control can be used for political gain. Technology is politics by other means.”']",May 2020 McKinsey study,"['NavigationClose', 'Rob Monster', 'UN', 'António Guterres', 'Freedom House', 'Toki', 'Toki', 'eRise', 'Toki', 'eRise', 'Rob Monster', 'Epik', 'Parler', 'Amazon’s', 'Parler', 'Epik', 'Monster’s', 'Parler', 'Joan Donovan', 'the Technology and Social Change Research Project', 'Epik’s', 'The Southern Poverty Law Center', 'Rob Davis', 'Epik', 'Davis', 'Epik', 'Toki', 'Raspberry Pi', 'Google', 'Epik’s Davis', 'Davis', 'eRise', 'Davis', 'Toki', 'Toki', 'eRise', 'Epik’s', 'Gab', 'Parler', 'COVID-19', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'ArticleThe', 'Mark Harris10:55 PM GMT+1•January 22', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/BV4sTMt9Io,2021-01-22T21:20:50,End-to-end operators are the next generation of consumer business,"['Roger LeeContributorShare on Twitter Roger Lee is a general partner at Battery Ventures, based in Menlo Park, CA, who focuses on investments in software and consumer tech, including online marketplaces.\tMore posts by this contributorKeys to ascending the consumer-internet throneHow to communicate with your board in tough timesJustin Da RosaContributorShare on Twitter Justin Da Rosa is a vice president with Battery Ventures in San Francisco. He focuses on consumer internet, online marketplace and software investments.\tMore posts by this contributorFive success factors for behavioral health startupsAt Battery, a central part of our consumer investing practice involves tracking the evolution of where and how consumers find and purchase goods and services. From our annual Battery Marketplace Index, we’ve seen seismic shifts in how consumer purchasing behavior has changed over the years, starting with the move to the web and, more recently, to mobile and on-demand via smartphones.The evolution looks like this in a nutshell: In the early days, listing sites like Craigslist, Angie’s List* and Yelp effectively put the Yellow Pages online — you could find a new restaurant or plumber on the web, but the process of contacting them was largely still offline. As consumers grew more comfortable with the web, marketplaces like eBay, Etsy, Expedia and Wayfair* emerged, enabling historically offline transactions to occur online.More recently, and spurred in large part by mobile, on-demand use cases, managed marketplaces like Uber, DoorDash, Instacart and StockX* have taken online consumer purchasing a step further. They play a greater role in the operations of the marketplace, from automatically matching demand with supply, to verifying the supply side for quality, to dynamic pricing. \n\t\t\tThe key purpose of being end-to-end is to deliver an even better value proposition to consumers relative to incumbent alternatives.\t\t\t\t\tEach stage of this evolution unlocked billions of dollars in value, and many of the names listed above remain the largest consumer internet companies today.At their core, these companies are facilitators, matching consumer demand with existing supply of a product or service. While there is no doubt these companies play a hugely valuable role in our lives, we increasingly believe that simply facilitating a transaction or service isn’t enough. Particularly in industries where supply is scarce, or in old-guard industries where innovation in the underlying product or service is slow, a digitized marketplace — even when managed — can produce underwhelming experiences for consumers.In these instances, starting from the ground up is what is really required to deliver an optimal consumer experience. Back in 2014, Chris Dixon wrote a bit about this phenomenon in his post on “Full stack startups.” Fast forward several years, and more startups than ever are “full stack” or as we call it, “end-to-end operators.”These businesses are fundamentally reimagining their product experience by owning the entire value chain,\xa0from\xa0end to end, thereby creating a step-functionally better experience for consumers. Owning more in the stack of operations gives these companies better control over quality, customer service, delivery, pricing and more — which gives consumers a better, faster and cheaper experience.It’s worth noting that these end-to-end models typically require more capital to reach scale, as greater upfront investment is necessary to get them off the ground than other, more narrowly focused marketplaces.\xa0But in our experience, the additional capital required is often outweighed by the value captured from owning the entire experience.End-to-end operators span many verticalsMany of these businesses have reached meaningful scale across industries:Image Credits: Battery Ventures (opens in a new window)All of these companies have recognized they can deliver more value to consumers by “owning” every aspect of the underlying product or service — from the bike to the workout content in Peloton’s case, or the bank account to the credit card in Chime’s case. They have reinvented and reimagined the entire consumer experience, from end to end.What does success for end-to-end operator businesses look like?As investors, we’ve had the privilege of meeting with many of these next-generation end-to-end operators over the years and found that those with the greatest success tend to exhibit the five key elements below:1. Going after very large marketsThe end-to-end approach makes the most sense when disrupting very large markets. In the graphic above, notice that most of these companies play in the largest, but notoriously archaic industries like banking, insurance, real estate, healthcare, etc. Incumbents in these industries are very large and entrenched, but they are legacy players, making them slow to adopt new technology. For the most part, they have failed to meet the needs of our digital-native, mobile-savvy generation and their experiences lag behind consumer expectations of today (evidenced by low, or sometimes even negative, NPS scores). Rebuilding the experience from the ground up is sometimes the only way to satisfy today’s consumers in these massive markets.2.

Since the pandemic began, consumer adoption of remote healthcare has increased 300%.Speaking as an unvaccinated urban dweller: I’d rather speak to a nurse or doctor via my laptop than try to remain physically distanced on a bus or hailed ride traveling to/from their office.Even after things return to (rolls eyes) normal, if I thought there was a reliable way to receive high-quality healthcare in my living room, I’d choose it.Clearly, I’m not alone: a May 2020 McKinsey study pegged yearly domestic telehealth revenue at $3 billion before the coronavirus, but estimated that “up to $250 billion of current U.S. healthcare spend could potentially be virtualized” after the pandemic abates.That’s a staggering number, but in a category that includes startups focused on sexual health, women’s health, pediatrics, mental health, data management and testing, it’s clear to see why digital-health funding topped more than $10 billion in the first three quarters of 2020.Drawing from The TechCrunch List, reporter Sarah Buhr interviewed eight active health tech VCs to learn more about the companies and industry verticals that have captured their interest in 2021:Bryan Roberts and Bob Kocher, partners, VenrockNan Li, managing director, Obvious VenturesElizabeth Yin, general partner, Hustle FundChristina Farr, principal investor and health tech lead, OMERS VenturesUrsheet Parikh, partner, Mayfield VenturesNnamdi Okike, co-founder and managing partner, 645 VenturesEmily Melton, founder and managing partner, Threshold VenturesFull Extra Crunch articles are only available to membersUse discount code ECFriday to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscriptionSince COVID-19 has renewed Washington’s focus on healthcare, many investors said they expect a friendly regulatory environment for telehealth in 2021.

The idea is that this will ensure that as operating systems, devices and tech evolves, your entire digital legacy will remain safe, secure and accessible — to only those you choose.Image Credits: EmortalThe platform is now set to be launched in the U.K. and U.S. in Q3 this year and will be designed for occasional considered use, for example when taking a picture at a christening, rather than saving every photo you take. It will charge a flat, standard subscription fee of £4.99 a month.Cerf said in a statement: “The cornerstone of the Emortal proposition is to tie data preservation in with digital legacy protection to ensure that our digital memories are safe and accessible for generations to come.”Colin Culross, founder and CEO of Emortal said: “We are\xa0keen to use the Crowdcube platform for this raise because Emortal is a service designed for ALL families.

https://t.co/CtCVpTvkgr,2021-01-22T20:02:00,Drupal’s journey from dorm-room project to billion-dollar exit,"[""Twenty years ago Drupal and Acquia founder Dries Buytaert was a college student at the University of Antwerp. He wanted to put his burgeoning programming skills to work by building a communications tool for his dorm. That simple idea evolved over time into the open-source Drupal web content management system, and eventually a commercial company called Acquia built on top of it.Buytaert would later raise over $180 million and exit in 2019 when the company was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $1 billion, but it took 18 years of hard work to reach that point. \n\t\t\tWhen Drupal came along in the early 2000s, it wasn’t the only open-source option, but it was part of a major movement toward giving companies options by democratizing web content management.\t\t\t\t\tMany startups are built on open source today, but back in the early 2000s, there were only a few trail blazers and none that had taken the path that Acquia took. Buytaert and his co-founders decided to reduce the complexity of configuring a Drupal installation by building a hosted cloud service.That seems like a no-brainer now, but consider at the time in 2009, AWS was still a fledgling side project at Amazon, not the $45 billion behemoth it is today. In 2021, building a startup on top of an open-source project with a SaaS version is a proven and common strategy. Back then nobody else had done it. As it turned out, taking the path less traveled worked out well for Acquia.Moving from dorm room to billion-dollar exit is the dream of every startup founder. Buytaert got there by being bold, working hard and thinking big. His story is compelling, but it also offers lessons for startup founders who also want to build something big.Born in the proverbial dorm roomIn the days before everyone had internet access and a phone in their pockets, Buytaert simply wanted to build a way for him and his friends to communicate in a centralized way. “I wanted to build kind of an internal message board really to communicate with the other people in the dorm, and it was literally talking about things like ‘Hey, let’s grab a drink at 8:00,'” Buytaert told me.He also wanted to hone his programming skills. “At the same time I wanted to learn about PHP and MySQL, which at the time were emerging technologies, and so I figured I would spend a few evenings putting together a basic message board using PHP and MySQL, so that I could learn about these technologies, and then actually have something that we could use.”The resulting product served its purpose well, but when graduation beckoned, Buytaert realized if he unplugged his PC and moved on, the community he had built would die. At that point, he decided to move the site to the public internet and named it drop.org, which was actually an accident. Originally, he meant to register dorp.org because “dorp” is Dutch for “village or small community,” but he mistakenly inverted the letters during registration.Buytaert continued adding features to drop.org like diaries (a precursor to blogging) and RSS feeds. Eventually, he came up with the idea of open-sourcing the software that ran the site, calling it Drupal.The birth of web content managementAbout the same time Buytaert was developing the basis of what would become Drupal, web content management (WCM) was a fresh market. Early websites had been fairly simple and straightforward, but they were growing more complex in the late 90s and a bunch of startups were trying to solve the problem of managing them. Buytaert likely didn’t know it, but there was an industry waiting for an open-source tool like Drupal.""]",The “Fresh Start” initiative,"['Miller@ron_miller / 9:02 PM GMT+1•January 22', 'Acquia', 'Dries Buytaert', 'the University of Antwerp', 'Acquia', 'Vista Equity Partners', 'Acquia', 'Amazon', 'SaaS', 'Acquia', 'Buytaert', 'PHP', 'PHP', 'RSS', 'Buytaert', 'WCM', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsCloudEnterpriseFundings & ExitsM&ASaaSTCAcquiadries', 'Dries Buytaert', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/xNPaqmoOEi,2021-01-22T19:38:54,Microsoft withdraws Xbox Live Gold price hike following uproar from users,"['Updated at 10:26PM PT, January 22: Microsoft is backtracking on the planned price hike of Xbox Live Gold, less than 24 hours after making the announcement as the gaming giant attempts to mend its relationship with fans.“We messed up today and you were right to let us know. Connecting and playing with friends is a vital part of gaming and we failed to meet the expectations of players who count on it every day. As a result, we have decided not to change Xbox Live Gold pricing,” the company wrote in a blog post.Microsoft said it is going a step further to make up with Xbox users. The company said free-to-play games on Xbox will no longer require an Xbox Live Gold subscription for online play. “We are working hard to deliver this change as soon as possible in the coming months,” the company wrote.Our original story from earlier Friday follows.————————————————In what feels like an attempt at kicking some bad news under the rug on a Friday, Microsoft announced this morning that the price of Xbox Live Gold is going up.Here’s how the price changes break down:The one-month plan is going from $10 per month to $11.The three-month plan is going from $25 to $30.The six-month plan is going from $40 to $60 — but only for new customers, says Microsoft.“But what about the twelve-month plan? Didn’t they used to offer those?”They did! It was $60 — or the price that a six-month subscription will go for now. They stopped selling twelve-month plans back in July of last year, presumably because this change was on the horizon and they would’ve had to acknowledge on the price tag that 12 months of Live Gold would cost $120.The good news: the price hike on the six-month plan only impacts new customers. If you’ve already got a six-month subscription (or are grandfathered into an auto-renewing twelve-month subscription), Xbox Support confirmed in a tweet that the price won’t increase:If you’re an existing online 12-month or 6-month Xbox Live Gold member, there’s no price change. If you choose to renew your membership, it will renew at your current price.https://t.co/wFJmElI5dH— Xbox Support (@XboxSupport) January 22, 2021If you’re on the one-month or three-month plans, though, it sounds like you’ll be paying the new price.So why bump the cost? Microsoft doesn’t officially outline their reasoning (beyond pointing out that they haven’t increased the price in years, or as long as a decade in some regions), but one can assume it’s at least partially to make the $15 a month Xbox Game Pass (which bundles Xbox Live Gold with a library of all-you-can-eat, on-demand titles) that much more alluring.Manish Singh contributed to this report.']",Rivian raises $2.65B as it pushes toward production of its electric pickup,"['Microsoft', 'NavigationClose ScreenMicrosoft', 'Kumparak@grg / 8:38', 'Darrell EtheringtonUpdated', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox Live Gold', 'Microsoft', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox Live Gold', 'Microsoft', '’ve', 'Xbox Support', 'Microsoft', 'Manish Singh', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox Live Gold', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/M4UhUdnigf,2021-01-22T19:39:45,Boston Globe will consider people’s requests to have articles about them anonymized,"['The Boston Globe is starting a new program by which people who feel an article at the newspaper is harmful to their reputation can ask that it be updated or anonymized. It’s reminiscent of the EU’s “right to be forgotten,” though potentially less controversial, since it concerns only one editorial outlet and not a content-agnostic search engine.The “Fresh Start” initiative isn’t for removing bad restaurant reviews or coverage of serious crimes, but rather for more commonplace crime desk reporting: a hundred words saying so-and-so was arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, perhaps with a mugshot.Such stories do serve a purpose, of course, in informing readers of crime in their area. But as the Globe’s editor, Brian McGrory points out:It was never our intent to have a short and relatively inconsequential Globe story affect the futures of the ordinary people who might be the subjects. Our sense, given the criminal justice system, is that this has had a disproportionate impact on people of color. The idea behind the program is to start addressing it.Evidence of bias in policing, which is turned into inherited bias in reporting, is a serious problem and one the country has been grappling with for decades. But it is exacerbated by the nature of the digital record.An employer looking at an application has only to search for the name or a few other details to find any standout information, such as a crime sheet entry with a mugshot. And while outlets often cover low-level arrests, they rarely cover low-level acquittals or dropped charges. No one clicks on those, after all. So for many the result is incomplete and therefore potentially damaging information.The attempt in Europe to fix this at the search engine level has been met with opposition and difficulty, since search engines are not in charge of the information they index and felt they should not be put in the position of deciding what should or shouldn’t be removed. Furthermore the task may be complex, as a single article may be replicated or referenced dozens or thousands of times, or backed up on a site like the Internet Archive. What then?At the same time, it’s certainly less of a threat to free speech to ask a search engine to limit discoverability than to ask a publication to remove or change its content. The debate is ongoing.Advisor to Europe’s top court favors regional limit to ‘right to be forgotten’The Globe’s approach is nowhere near as comprehensive as making Google “forget” a person’s record, but it is considerably simpler and less open to opposition. The paper exerts editorial control over itself, of course, and the question is not one of putting a piece of information down the memory hole, but revisiting whether it was newsworthy to begin with.“It’s changing how we look at our coverage,” said managing editor for digital Jason Tuohey in the Globe announcement of its new endeavor. “If we change a story like this with the Fresh Start committee, why would we assign one like it next week?”The newspaper has established a 10-person committee to examine petitions from people asking to have articles updated — never removed, it’s important to add. While an earlier effort like this at the Cleveland Plain Dealer required people to show a court record expungement order, there is no legal bar to meet here.The team admits off the bat that this will be complicated. Automated or fraudulent requests will surely pour in, public figures will take a shot, there will be conflicting opinions on what evidence, if any, is required to confirm an event or identity, and so on. And at the end, all that will be accomplished is one article, perhaps even just one line, will be altered — long after it has been replicated across the web and archival infrastructure. But it’s a start.One paper doing this may not have a large effect, but if the program is successful other outlets may take notice. And as Tuohey noted, the wisdom of publishing the information in the first place starts to look shaky when one learns how ramshackle the justice system really is. Perhaps it’s only fair that people have a shot at applying that newfound skepticism to events of years past.Anyone who thinks they could benefit from Fresh Start can apply here.']",skin tone ranges feature,"['Boston Globe', 'NavigationClose ScreenBoston Globe', 'window)The Boston Globe', 'EU', 'Globe', 'Brian McGrory', 'Globe', 'forgotten’The Globe’s', 'Jason Tuohey', 'Globe', 'the Fresh Start', 'the Cleveland Plain Dealer', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsMediaPrivacyTCarticlescommunicationdiscoverabilityeditorEuropeGooglegoogle', 'Globe', 'Boston Globe', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

LS Power and EVgo management, which today own 100% of the company will be rolling all of its equity into the transaction. Once the transaction closes in the second quarter, LS Power and EVgo will hold a 74% stake in the newly combined company.EVgo has raised about $575 million in proceeds through the business combination, including a $400 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Investors include Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (PIMCO), funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Wellington Management, Neuberger Berman Funds and Van Eck Associates Corporation, according to the announcement.EVgo’s leadership will remain intact, with Cathy Zoi continuing as CEO of the combined company.The deal is the latest in a long string of electric-vehicle-related companies to merge with so-called blank check companies, eschewing the traditional path to an IPO. Arrival, Canoo, ChargePoint, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, Proterra and The Lion Electric Company are some of the companies that have merged with SPACs — or announced plans to — in the past eight months.EVgo is not a new entrant to the electric vehicle industry. The company was founded in 2010 and has spent better part of the decade scaling up its infrastructure. Today, EVgo has chargers in more than 800 locations in 67 major metropolitan markets across 34 states. The company has landed a number of partnerships, including with Albertsons, Kroger and Wawa to locate its chargers at these properties.EVgo has also struck deals with automakers such as GM and Nissan as well as ride-hailing companies Lyft and Uber. In July, GM and EVgo announced plans to add more than 2,700 new fast chargers over the next five years.While electric vehicles still make up just a fraction of total cars, trucks and SUVs on today’s roads, the industry has forecast that the EV market will increase more than 100-fold between 2019 and 2040, EVgo said. The funds raised through the public market will be used to accelerate its expansion, according to the company.“Just a few years ago, electric vehicles were considered niche,” EVgo CEO Cathy Zoi said in a statement. “Today, improved technology, lower costs, greater selection and a better appreciation for the performance of EVs is increasingly making them the vehicle technology of choice. With that, the need for fast charging is on the rise.”Zoi noted that public charging will be essential to meet the needs of the estimated 30% of Americans who do not have access to at-home charging as well as the growing number of fleets that are switching to electric vehicles.Rivian raises $2.65B as it pushes toward production of its electric pickup']",,"['EV', 'EV', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'LS Power', 'LS Power', 'LS Power', 'PIPE', 'Pacific Investment Management Company LLC', 'PIMCO', 'BlackRock', 'Wellington Management', 'Neuberger Berman Funds', 'Van Eck Associates Corporation', 'Cathy Zoi', 'Arrival', 'Canoo', 'ChargePoint', 'Fisker', 'Lordstown Motors', 'Proterra', 'The Lion Electric Company', 'Wawa', 'GM', 'Nissan', 'GM', 'EV', 'Cathy Zoi', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAutomotiveTransportationArrivalCanooelectric vehiclesevgoEVgo', 'EV', 'LS Power', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/CiQijLl2Mj,2021-01-22T17:00:24,Pinterest launches an AR-powered try-on experience for eyeshadow,"['Pinterest is expanding its virtual makeup try-on capabilities with today’s launch of a new augmented reality feature that allows online shoppers to virtually try on new eyeshadow. Initially, Pinterest is allowing try-on with 4,000 shades from brands like Lancome, YSL, Urban Decay and NYX Cosmetics.The feature leverages Pinterest’s existing Lens visual search technology, its skin tone ranges feature and computer-vision-powered recommendations, the company says. We also understand Pinterest is incorporating elements from data partner ModiFace, including digitization parameters that ensure the products recognized are mapped to ModiFace’s database for higher-quality rendering.This is not Pinterest’s first virtual makeup feature. The company had previously launched an AR try-on experience for lipstick a year ago, which has now grown to include 10,000 shades, discoverable from 48 million beauty pins from brands like Estée Lauder, bareMinerals, Neutrogena, NARS, Cle de Peau, Thrive Causemetics, NYX Professional Makeup, YSL Beauté, Lancôme and Urban Decay. Retailers, including Kohl’s, have also used AR try-on to reach consumers.With the newly launched eyeshadow try-on, users can filter the product search results by factors like color, price range and brand. If they find something they like, they can then purchase it immediately, save it to a board, or browse a “more like this” section to find more Pins offering similar shades.Image Credits: PinterestThe expansion to eyeshadow means users can now experiment with more of a full makeup look, rather than just try on individual shades. There’s a toggle that lets users switch between lipstick and eyeshadow to try on multiple products at once, Pinterest says.AR-powered virtual makeup experiences have been growing in popularity over the years, thanks in part to AR beauty apps like Perfect Corp’s YouCam Makeup,\xa0Sephora’s Virtual Artist,\xa0Ulta’s GLAMLab and others. L’Oréal has also offered Live Try-On on its website and partnered with Facebook to bring virtual makeup to the site. Target’s online Beauty Studio also offers virtual makeup.More recently, Google entered the AR virtual makeup space, initially with the launch of a more limited feature on YouTube that allowed some beauty influencers to incorporate an AR try-on experience for products in their videos. In December 2020, however, Google more fully embraced AR try-on with the launch of virtual makeup try-on within Google Search, also in partnership with ModiFace.But Pinterest’s expansion to eyeshadow means it’s once again ahead of Google when it comes to visual search technology and virtual makeup. Not only does it offer more lipstick shades than Google, it now also offers eyeshadow try-on.Pinterest says the AR try-on feature is being made available for free to brands who want to create visual shopping experiences and reach customers earlier in their decision-making process. The company says it continues to generate revenue through ads, including shopping ads, and not by monetizing its AR features or doing any revenue share on the try-ons that turn into sales.“As we make Pinterest more shoppable through products like AR Try on, the platform becomes more engaging and actionable to Pinners, which can result in increases in usage and click-through of ads,” a spokesperson explains. “Organic features like Try on and ingestion of catalogs to create product Pins can oftentimes complement a paid strategy where brands drive traffic across the site,” they noted.The support for eyeshadow try-on is timely. Some beauty brand sales have been depressed by the pandemic, and particularly lipsticks, since it makes no sense to use lip color when your face is under a mask. Instead, current beauty trends have shifted to highlighting the eyes, with bright and bold colors for eyeshadow shades, the wild floating eyeliner look, large false lashes, and more — trends that are also designed to look good when filmed for social media posts, of course.Pinterest says it has indications that its AR features are converting undecided shoppers to customers. In 2020, Pinterest found that users would try on an average of six lipstick shades once they began the AR try-on experience, and then were five times more likely to show purchase intent on try-on compared with standard Pins.The new eyeshadow try-on is live starting today using the Lens camera in the Pinterest app for iOS and Android.Correction: Perfect Corp runs YouCam makeup, not ModiFAce.

https://t.co/mWsSAYr1ub,2021-01-22T17:00:14,Google refreshes its mobile search experience,"['Google today announced a subtle but welcome refresh of its mobile search experience. The idea here is to provide easier to read search results and a more modern look with a simpler, edge-to-edge design.From what we’ve seen so far, this is not a radically different look, but the rounded and slightly shaded boxes around individual search results have been replaced with straight lines, for example, while in other places, Google has specifically added more roundness. You’ll find changes to the circles around the search bar and some tweaks to the Google logo. “We believe it feels more approachable, friendly and human,” a Google spokesperson told me. There’s a bit more whitespace in places, too, as well as new splashes of color that are meant to help separate and emphasize certain parts of the page.Image Credits: Google“Rethinking the visual design for something like Search is really complex,” Google designer Aileen Cheng said in today’s announcement. “That’s especially true given how much Google Search has evolved. We’re not just organizing the web’s information, but all the world’s information. We started with organizing web pages, but now there’s so much diversity in the types of content and information we have to help make sense of.”Image Credits: GoogleGoogle is also extending its use of the Google Sans font, which you are probably already quite familiar with thanks to its use in Gmail and Android. “Bringing consistency to when and how we use fonts in Search was important, too, which also helps people parse information more efficiently,” Cheng writes.In many ways, today’s refresh is a continuation of the work Google did with its mobile search refresh in 2019. At that time, the emphasis, too, was on making it easier for users to scan down the page by adding site icons and other new visual elements to the page. The work of making search results pages more readable is clearly never done.For the most part, though, comparing the new and old design, the changes are small. This isn’t some major redesign — we’re talking about minor tweaks that the designers surely obsessed over but that the users may not even really notice. Now if Google had made it significantly easier to distinguish ads from the content you are actually looking for, that would’ve been something.Image Credits: Google']",broader venture capital results,"['NavigationClose', 'Alex Tai', 'Google', 'Aileen Cheng', 'GoogleGoogle', 'Gmail', 'Android', 'Cheng', 'Google', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsMobileAndroidcomputingdesignergmailGooglegoogle', 'WorkspaceGoogle-DriveMobile-Searchoperating', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/X52DUx1BFO,2021-01-22T16:58:31,Sounding Board raises cash as startups wake up to executive coaching,"['In an unprecedented work environment defined by distributed teams and virtual-only communication, two co-founders think their 2018 bet reigns truer than ever: mentors need mentorship, too.Christine Tao and Lori Mazan, the brains behind Sounding Board, want to train any leader within an organization to be a better leader. The San Francisco startup connects anyone from first-time managers to C-suite executives with coaches through a marketplace.Revenue has doubled or tripled every year since 2016, which the company says hovers in the “multi-millions” range. But in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Sounding Board has seen demand for its platform grow even more. Quarterly bookings have increased 3.4 times from Q2 2020, and in the last five months, monthly revenue has doubled.On the heels of this growth, the co-founders say that Sounding Board’s next step as a startup is to grow beyond coaching services and into a platform that can show leaders how those newfound skills are impacting business development. The new product is meant to serve as a hub and roadmap where a participant and coach can track insights, progress and behaviors.Within the platform, a user can schedule sessions with a coach, get matched to someone, as well as look at resources and complete tasks assigned to them. Beyond that, there is a feature that allows the coach and the manager to measure goals on an ongoing basis, similar to OKR-related software.“The content is great, but unless you can apply that content, it’s not very useful,” Mazan said. “So this coaching is a way to help people apply the insights and the learning they’ve gotten from some kind of content and really utilize that in the workplace.”The new product takes the monthly in-person summit that your organization used to call executive coaching and turns it into a living, breathing part of a manager’s workflow.Beyond helping its users have a better temperature check on their progress, the product will help Sounding Board scale its services. Now any tutor on Sounding Board has more ways into a user’s mind and workflow, so every call isn’t synchronous and can be managed more evenly.The co-founders see their long-term differentiation living in this feature. Anyone can create a marketplace, but it takes seamless, easy-to-use tech to track the effectiveness of what happens post-coaching.Tao admits that the startup isn’t for everyone. Sounding Board has seen early adoption around enterprise companies that are in a late-stage, hyper-growth mindset heading toward an IPO. That level of maturity is a sweet spot for a third-party such as them to come in and scale leaders across teams. Customers include VMware, Uber, Plaid, Chime and Dropbox.Why is everyone making OKR software?That said, within organizations, 60% of Sounding Board’s users are first-time managers, 30% are middle-tier and 10% are C-suite. The co-founders think these numbers indicate a broader demand for mentorship beyond what their competitors offer, which often sticks to C-suite life coach territory or stress management.“Everyone is starting to realize that we’re going to have to offer coaching broader than just in the C-suite, and sometimes they don’t really know what that means,” said Mazan.The realization, along with COVID-19 tailwinds, has helped Sounding Board attract new millions in venture capital. The startup tells TechCrunch that it has raised a $13.1 million Series A led by Canaan Partners. Other investors include Correlation Ventures, Bloomberg Beta, Precursor Ventures, as well as Degreed founder David Blake and Kevin Johnson, the former CEO of Udemy.']",Dashlane,"['Sounding Board', 'NavigationClose ScreenSounding Board', 'z_wei / Getty ImagesIn', 'Christine Tao', 'Lori Mazan', 'Sounding Board', 'Sounding Board', 'Sounding Board’s', 'OKR', 'Mazan', 'Sounding Board', 'Sounding Board', 'Tao', 'Sounding Board', 'VMware', 'OKR', 'Sounding Board’s', 'Mazan', 'Sounding Board', 'Canaan Partners', 'Correlation Ventures', 'Bloomberg Beta', 'Precursor Ventures', 'David Blake', 'Kevin Johnson', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Board', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

(We’re speaking soon with folks who may have data on African VC activity in 2020; if those bear out, we’ll do a final entry in our series concerning the continent.)After digging into the United States’ broader venture capital results from last year with an extra eye on fintech and unicorn investing, at least one trend was clear: Venture capital is getting later and larger (as expected).Record dollar amounts were being invested, but across falling deal volume. More money and fewer rounds meant larger rounds, often going to the late and super-late stage startups in the market.Unicorns are feasting, in other words, while some younger startups struggle to raise capital.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.There have been some encouraging signs of seed activity, mind, but full-year data made it clear that in America, the more mature startups had the best of it.But what about the rest of the world?

But not entire reproductions.Let’s discuss key data points from the two reports. This will be illustrative, brief and painless. Into the data!European VCs: Rich, but not evenly distributedCompared to historical investment levels, KPMG’s European VC report describes a venture capital scene at its peak. Q4 2020 saw $14.3 billion invested into EU startups across 1,192 deals, the highest dollar amount charted and a modest besting of the previous record set in Q3 2020.However, despite impressive investment totals, the number of deals that the money was spread over proved lackluster.The Q4 2020 deal count was the lowest on record since the continent’s deal peak in Q1 2019.

What they didn’t anticipate was the sudden uptick in demand fueled by COVID-19 and the uncertainty and chaos that the pandemic created.MotoRefi, which was born out of QED Investors in 2017, developed an auto refinancing platform that handles the entire process, including finding the best rates, paying off the old lender and re-titling the vehicle. The company has benefitted from the convergence of two trends sparked by COVID-19 that has turbocharged its business: an accelerated adoption of fintech across the economy and growing attention toward personal finance.\xa0Now, investors are pouring more money into the startup to help it make the most of the spike in demand for auto refinancing.MotoRefi said Friday it has raised $10 million in a round led by Moderne Ventures. Liza Benson, a partner at Moderne Ventures, will join the board.“Many people are looking around saying how can they save money?” Bennett said, commenting on the events of the past year. “And while auto refinance historically is in a relatively low awareness category of personal finance, that interest has really grown and accelerated through 2020.”For instance, Google searches for auto refinance increased about 40% in 2020 over the previous year, he added.The company said its revenue rose by sixfold, its workforce tripled to more than 150 people and the number of lenders on its platform doubled over the past year. MotoRefi said it refinanced more than $250 million of auto loans in 2020.“We actually weren’t planning on raising twice in a year,” Bennett said. “But the growth had been pretty noticeable from the investor standpoint in the market.”That new capital will be used to hire more employees and expand its offerings, according to Bennett, who noted that MotoRefi now operates in 42 states and Washington, DC.MotoRefi has raised more than $24 million to date. The company raised $8.6 million last February in a Series A funding round. That round, which would later grow to $9.4 million, was co-led by Accomplice and Link Ventures. Motley Fool Ventures, CMFG Ventures (part of CUNA Mutual Group) and Gaingels also participated in the round.

https://t.co/viATmibdbR,2021-01-22T15:05:30,"Dashlane taps JD Sherman, ex-Hubspot COO, as new CEO, as co-founder Emmanuel Schalit steps aside","['Our reliance on internet-based services is at an all-time high these days, and that’s brought a new focus on how well we are protected when we go online. Today comes some news from one of the bigger companies working in the area of password security, which points out how business is shifting for the companies providing these tools.Emmanuel Schalit, the co-founder of popular password manager Dashlane, is stepping down as CEO of the startup. He is being replaced by JD Sherman, the former COO of HubSpot, as Dashlane makes plans to move more aggressively to court more business users.“This is about thinking about its next leg of our scaling strategy, more B2B monetization after being strong in B2C,” Sherman said in an interview, praising his predecessor’s growth of the consumer business and noting his realization that “B2B was not his forte.”Sherman’s career focus, in contrast, has been all about B2B. Before his eight years at HubSpot, he was the CFO of Akamai (which, as a CDN, also had security as a focus, albeit in a completely different way), and before that IBM.Since accepting the offer, Sherman (pictured right) has been quietly working with Schalit — who will no longer hold any operational role — to get up to speed and will be taking over formally at the start of February.Sherman is based out of Boston and will eventually commute to Dashlane’s HQ in New York (“eventually” because everyone is remote-working at the moment, with Sherman himself getting hired in a virtual process).The changing of the guard comes at an interesting time for the startup. Dashlane now has 15 million users, up from 10 million+ in 2019. That was the same year that Dashlane announced two significant rounds of funding just six weeks apart from each other: first a $30 million round (which appeared to have some debt as part of it), then a $110 million Series D that valued the company at just over $500 million. Its backers include the likes of Sequoia, Bessemer, FirstMark, Rho Ventures and consumer credit reporting giant TransUnion.Sherman would not talk about current valuation, nor where the company is currently standing regarding its next financial steps, except to say that it’s in a good place and to provide the smallest of hints of an IPO on the horizon.“The Series D was a healthy round for a subscription business,” he said. “Right now, cashflow is solid and we have the funding we need for our growth, so there is no urgent plan to raise money. When we do, we’ll see if it is an IPO round” — that is, the last round before an IPO — “or not. To me, it’s all about growing the business.”My guess: that valuation has gone up, given the boost in user numbers, the growth of its enterprise business and the huge shifts in the market in the last year that have put a spotlight on companies that are making using the internet safer. (Also, note that LogMeIn, which owns competitor LastPass, was picked up by PE firms for about $4.3 billion in a deal that completed last year.)Use ‘productive paranoia’ to build cybersecurity culture at your startupDashlane was founded focused primarily on providing password management tools for consumers. These still account for the majority of its users, but the Series D funding was in part to fuel a bigger push into the business market, and to generally get on the radar of more people.The expansion into business users was a natural move in more ways than one. First, the consumer service is designed as a freemium offering, while businesses provide a more steady and guaranteed revenue stream. Second, there is a natural progression that comes from being a happy consumer user: you might want to have the same service for your online work life, too. That remains the strategy for Sherman.“The plan is to have two sides to the business,” he said, using the well-worn consumer-to-business analogy of a flywheel to describe how it will work: “The more who use it, more businesses will start to adopt it and get comfortable with using a password manager.”That strategy is lately getting a major fillip, in the form of the massive boost in online activity in the past year.Activities like taking care of all your shopping, entertainment, social and work-related needs have all moved online in the last year, pushed into the virtual sphere by the emergence and persistent presence of the easily contagious and dangerous COVID-19 virus.Some of that shift has worked out better than many thought it would, and now, some believe that even when the pandemic does get under control, a lot of us will still be using the internet to get all of those things done on a regular basis.But while I’ve heard a lot of industry people describe that situation as “the genie is out of the bottle”, perhaps a more fitting expression might be that Pandora’s box has been opened. That is to say, the increased online usage has created an alarmingly large opportunity for malicious hacking, security breaches and misuse of our online identities.This consequently has a pretty direct link back to Dashlane.Password protection is one of the most important elements of keeping yourself and your information safe online, with weak, stolen and reused passwords some of the biggest causes of security breaches both for consumers and businesses (by some estimates, you can track 80-90% of all security breaches back to password issues).Beyond that, not least because of all the breaches we’ve now seen, the current market has become much more concerned about privacy and security (a trend manifesting in all kinds of ways), and that has bred a lot more awareness and appetite for the kinds of tools that Dashlane, and other companies that enable better online security, provide.There will likely continue to be developments in the technology to both suss out bad actors and block them in their tracks when they do try to enter networks, and the technology sold to organizations to keep their and their customers’ information in the cloud in more secure ways will also be improved. But above and beyond all that, password managers are likely to continue to play a role in the mix.Google is making autofill on Chrome for mobile more securePassword managers may not always be a perfect solution — there have been a few cases of breaches over the years, and while they have not been in recent times, security researchers at the University of York in May 2020 identified vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited — but they remain a relatively easy option for end users themselves to be more proactive in protecting their identities specifically by building a better way to guard their passwords. (Among all that, it’s also worth pointing out that Dashlane has never had a breach in its 10+ years of operations.)And there are a number of routes to providing password management, including efforts from platform players themselves and more direct Dashlane competitors like 1Password and LastPass. Notably, some of the efforts to bridge some of that together, such as the “OpenYolo” project spearheaded by Google and Dashlane, have stalled over the years, in part because of the complexity of implementing it with other existing managers.But even within that fragmented, competitive and (still at times) vulnerable market, Dashlane still has a lot of opportunities for growth.“The business is strong and growing,” Sherman said. “The craziness around COVID and remote networking have raised the profile of password management and security in general.

Blobr is also the first company to take investment from New Wave — the new European venture capital firm co-founded by Pia d’Iribarne and Jean de la Rochebrochard — since the VC confirmed it had closed $56 million in deployable capital from an all-star lineup of investors, including Iliad’s Xavier Niel, Benchmark’s Peter Fenton and Tony Fadell of Apple fame.Blobr, founded by Alexandre Airvault (CEO) and Alexandre Mai (CTO), is aiming to become the default “business and product layer” for APIs. This idea is to enable product and business people to manage and monetise a company’s application programming interfaces without technical knowledge or the need to use up more internal engineering resources. And by doing so, the startup believes we’ll see much more innovative use of APIs as commercial data and functionality is made accessible by more third parties to build on top.“We believe companies should stop thinking of APIs as mere pipes and start building them as products to unleash their power,” says Airvault. “This means APIs should be priced, customized and managed with a user-oriented mindset and not only a tech one”.To make this a reality, Blobr is designed to empower product and business owners to “make data-sharing a profitable model”, while reducing their dependence on tech. “I believe this approach is what will drive the data exchanges to the next level”, he explains.Blobr’s no-code technology offers quite a lot of functionality already. From one existing internal API, you can filter confidential information or GDPR-related data; it’s also possible to deliver different API output depending on customer segmentation so you only expose the data that’s needed; and API usage can be linked to usage-based business models or a monthly subscription in Stripe.Airvault says the startup’s main competitors include API management solutions from Google, IBM, Axway and MuleSoft. “Those platforms are tailored for internal APIs but are not thought of and optimized to manage APIs as products. They are tailored for technical people, whereas Blobr as a no-code solution is built from scratch for product and business people to avoid technical people to be involved in the equation,” he adds.New Wave is a new European seed fund headed up by ex-Accel VC Pia d’Iribarne']",Project Fair Shot initiative,"['Blobr', 'BlobrBlobr', 'Kima', 'Blobr', 'New Wave', 'Pia d’Iribarne', 'Jean de la Rochebrochard', 'VC', 'Iliad’s', 'Xavier Niel', 'Benchmark’s', 'Peter Fenton', 'Tony Fadell', 'Apple', 'Blobr', 'Alexandre Airvault', 'Alexandre Mai', 'Airvault', 'Blobr', 'Blobr’s', 'Stripe', 'Airvault', 'Google', 'IBM', 'Axway', 'MuleSoft', 'Blobr', 'New Wave', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropeFundings & ExitsRecent', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/rC4BRuk305,2021-01-22T14:46:58,Google threatens to close its search engine in Australia as it lobbies against digital news code,"['Google has threatened to close its search engine in Australia — as it dials up its lobbying against draft legislation that is intended to force it to pay news publishers for reuse of their content.Facebook would also be subject to the law. And Facebook has previously said it would ban news from being shared on its products owing if the law was brought in, as well as claiming it’s reduced its investment in the country as a result of the legislative threat.“The principle of unrestricted linking between websites is fundamental to Search. Coupled with the unmanageable financial and operational risk if this version of the Code were to become law it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,” Google warned today.Last August the tech giant took another pot-shot at the proposal, warning that the quality of its products in the country could suffer and might stop being free if the government proceeded with a push to make the tech giants share ad revenue with media businesses.Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for newsSince last summer Google appears to have changed lobbying tack — apparently giving up its attempt to derail the law entirely in favor of trying to reshape it to minimize the financial impact.Its latest bit of lobbying is focused on trying to eject the most harmful elements (as it sees it) of the draft legislation — while also pushing its News Showcase program, which it hastily spun up last year, as an alternative model for payments to publishers that it would prefer becomes the vehicle for remittances under the Code.The draft legislation for Australia’s digital news Code which is currently before the parliament includes a controversial requirement that tech giants Google and Facebook pay publishers for linking to their content — not merely for displaying snippets of text.Yet Google has warned Australia that making it pay for “links and snippets” would break how the internet works.In a statement to the Senate Economics Committee today, its VP for Australia and New Zealand, Mel Silva, said: “This provision in the Code would set an untenable precedent for our business, and the digital economy. It’s not compatible with how search engines work, or how the internet works, and this is not just Google’s view — it has been cited in many of the submissions received by this Inquiry.“The principle of unrestricted linking between websites is fundamental to Search. Coupled with the unmanageable financial and operational risk if this version of the Code were to become law it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia.”Google is certainly not alone in crying foul over a proposal to require payments for links.Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, has warned that the draft legislation “risks breaching a fundamental principle of the web by requiring payment for linking between certain content online”, among other alarmed submissions to the committee.In written testimony he goes on:Before search engines were effective on the web, following links from one page to another was the only way of finding material. Search engines make that process far more effective, but they can only do so by using the link structure of the web as their principal input. So links are fundamental to the web.As I understand it, the proposed code seeks to require selected digital platforms to have to negotiate and possibly pay to make links to news content from a particular group of news providers.Requiring a charge for a link on the web blocks an important aspect of the value of web content. To my knowledge, there is no current example of legally requiring payments for links to other content. The ability to link freely — meaning without limitations regarding the content of the linked site and without monetary fees — is fundamental to how the web operates, how it has flourished till present, and how it will continue to grow in decades to come.However, it’s notable that Berners-Lee’s submission does not mention snippets. Not once. It’s all about links.Meanwhile, Google has just reached an agreement with publishers in France — which they say covers payment for snippets of content.Google inks agreement in France on paying publishers for news reuseIn the EU, the tech giant is subject to an already reformed copyright directive that extended a neighbouring right for news content to cover reuse of snippets of text. Although the directive does not cover links or “very short extracts”.In France, Google says it’s only paying for content “beyond links and very short extracts”. But it hasn’t said anything about snippets in that context.French publishers argue the EU law clearly does cover the not-so-short text snippets that Google typically shows in its News aggregator — pointing out that the directive states the exception should not be interpreted in a way that impacts the effectiveness of neighboring rights. So Google looks like it would have a big French fight on its hands if it tried to deny payments for snippets.But there’s still everything to play for in Australia. Hence, down under, Google is trying to conflate what are really two separate and distinct issues (payment for links versus payment for snippets) — in the hopes of reducing the financial impact versus what’s already baked into EU law. (Although it’s only been actively enforced in France so far, which is ahead of other EU countries in transposing the directive into national law.)In Australia, Google is also heavily pushing for the Code to “designate News Showcase” (aka the program it launched once the legal writing was on the wall about paying publishers) — lobbying for that to be the vehicle whereby it can reach “commercial agreements to pay Australian news publishers for value”.Of course, a commercial negotiation process is preferable (and familiar) to the tech giant versus being bound by the Code’s proposed “final offer arbitration model” — which Google attacks as having “biased criteria”, and claims subjects it to “unmanageable financial and operational risk”.“If this is replaced with standard commercial arbitration based on comparable deals, this would incentivise good faith negotiations and ensure we’re held accountable by robust dispute resolution,” Silva also argues.A third provision the tech giant is really keen gets removed from the current draft requires it to give publishers notification ahead of changes to its algorithms which could affect how their content is discovered.“The algorithm notification provision could be adjusted to require only reasonable notice about significant actionable changes to Google’s algorithm, to make sure publishers are able to respond to changes that affect them,” it suggests on that.It’s certainly interesting to consider how, over a few years, Google’s position has moved from “we’ll never pay for news” — pre- any relevant legislation — to “please let us pay for licensing news through our proprietary licensing program” once the EU had passed a directive now being very actively enforced in France (with the help of competition law) and also with Australia moving toward inking a similar law.Turns out legislation can be a real tech giant mind-changer.Of course the idea of making anyone pay to link to content online is obviously a terrible idea — and should be dropped.But if that bit of the draft is a negotiating tactic by Australian lawmakers to get Google to accept that it will have to pay publishers something then it appears to be a winning one.And while Google’s threat to close down its search engine might sound “full on”, as Silva suggests, when you consider how many alternative search engines exist, it’s hardly the threat it once was.Especially as plenty of alternative search engines are a lot less abusive toward users’ privacy.Google warns users in Australia free services are at risk if it’s forced to share ad revenue with ‘big media’']",scores of complaints across Europe,"['NavigationClose', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Alex Tai', 'News Showcase', 'Google', 'the Senate Economics Committee', 'Mel Silva', 'Tim Berners-Lee', 'Google', 'EU', 'Google', 'EU', 'Google', 'EU', 'EU', 'Google', 'News Showcase', 'the Code’s', 'Silva', 'Google’s', 'Google’s', 'EU', 'Google’s', 'Silva', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'ZealandGoogle', 'Lomas3:46', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/GTw0QMTfdW,2021-01-22T14:00:48,Cloudflare introduces free digital waiting rooms for any organizations distributing COVID-19 vaccines,"['Web infrastructure company Cloudflare is releasing a new tool today that aims to provide a way for health agencies and organizations globally tasked with rolling out COVID-19 vaccines to maintain a fair, equitable and transparent digital queue — completely free of charge. The company’s Project Fair Shot initiative will make its new Cloudflare Waiting Room offering free to any organization that qualifies, essentially providing a way for future vaccine recipients to register and gain access to a clear and constantly-updated view of where they are in line to receive the preventative treatment.“The wife of one of Cloudflare’s executives in our Austin office was trying to register her parents for the COVID-19 vaccine program there,” explained Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince via email. “The registration site kept crashing. She said to her husband: ‘Why doesn’t Cloudflare build a queuing feature to help vaccine sites?’ As it happened, we had exactly such a feature under development and scheduled to be launched in early February.”After realizing the urgency of the need for something like this tool to help alleviate the many infrastructure challenges that come up when you’re trying to vaccinate as quickly as possible a global population against a viral threat, Cloudflare changed their release timetable and devoted additional resources to the project.“We talked to the team about moving up the scheduled launch of our Waiting Room feature,” Prince added. “They worked around the clock because they recognized how important helping with vaccine delivery was. These are the sorts of projects that really drive our team: when we can use our technical expertise and infrastructure to solve problems with broad, positive impact.”Cloudflare and Apple design a new privacy-friendly internet protocolOn the technical side, Cloudflare Waiting Room is simple to implement, according to the company, and can be added to any registration website built on the company’s existing content delivery network without any engineering or coding knowledge required. Visitors to the site can register and will receive a confirmation that they’re in line, and then will receive a follow-up directing them to a sign-up page for the organization administering their vaccine when it’s their turn. Further configuration options allow Waiting Room operators to offer wait time estimates to registrants, as well as provide additional alerts when their turn is nearing (though that functionality is coming in a future update).As Prince mentioned, Waiting Room was already on Cloudflare’s project roadmap, and was actually intended for other high-demand, limited supply allocation items: Think must-have concert tickets, or the latest hot sneaker release. But the Fair Shot program will provide it totally free to those organizations that need it, whereas that would’ve been a commercial product. Interested parties can sign up at Cloudflare’s registration page to get on the waitlist for availability.“With Project Fair Shot we stand ready to help ensure everyone who is eligible can get equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccines and we, along with the rest of humanity, look forward to putting this disease behind us,” Prince explained.']",noyb,"['Cloudflare', 'COVID-19', 'NavigationClose ScreenCloudflare', 'COVID-19 vaccinesDarrell Etherington@etherington /', 'Malte Mueller / Getty ImagesWeb', 'Cloudflare', 'Project Fair Shot', 'Cloudflare Waiting Room', 'Cloudflare’s', 'Cloudflare', 'Matthew Prince', 'Cloudflare', 'Cloudflare', 'Waiting Room', 'Apple', 'Cloudflare Waiting Room', 'Waiting Room', 'Waiting Room', 'Cloudflare’s', 'Fair Shot', 'Cloudflare’s', 'Project Fair Shot', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'COVID-19 vaccinesDarrell', 'Cloudflare', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/rxUFPYAbju,2021-01-22T12:38:54,"UK resumes privacy oversight of adtech, warns platform audits are coming","['The U.K.’s data watchdog has restarted an investigation of adtech practices that, since 2018, have been subject to scores of complaints across Europe under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).The high velocity trading of internet users’ personal data can’t possibly be compliant with GDPR’s requirement that such information is adequately secured, the complaints contend.Other concerns attached to real-time bidding (RTB) focus on consent, questioning how this can meet the required legal standard with people’s data being broadcast to so many companies — including sensitive information, such as health data, religious and political affiliation and sexual orientation.Since the first complaints were filed, the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) has raised its own concerns over what it said are systemic problems with lawfulness in the adtech sector. But last year it announced it was pausing its investigation on account of disruption to businesses from the (ongoing) COVID-19 pandemic.Today it said it’s unpausing its multi-year probe to keep on prodding.Adtech scores a pandemic pause from UK privacy oversightIn an update on its website, ICO deputy commissioner Simon McDougall, who takes care of “Regulatory Innovation and Technology” at the agency, writes that the eight-month freeze is over. And the audits are coming.“We have now resumed our investigation,” he says. “Enabling transparency and protecting vulnerable citizens are priorities for the ICO. The complex system of RTB can use people’s sensitive personal data to serve adverts and requires people’s explicit consent, which is not happening right now.”“Sharing people’s data with potentially hundreds of companies, without properly assessing and addressing the risk of these counterparties, also raises questions around the security and retention of this data,” he goes on. “Our work will continue with a series of audits focusing on digital market platforms and we will be issuing assessment notices to specific companies in the coming months. The outcome of these audits will give us a clearer picture of the state of the industry.”IAB Europe’s ad tracking consent framework found to fail GDPR standardIt’s not clear what data the ICO still lacks to come to a decision on complaints that are approaching 2.5 years old at this point. But the ICO has committed to resume looking at adtech — including at data brokers, per McDougall, who writes that “we will be reviewing the role of data brokers in this adtech eco-system”.“The investigation is vast and complex and, because of the sensitivity of the work, there will be times where it won’t be possible to provide regular updates. However, we are committed to publishing our final findings, once the investigation is concluded”, he goes on, managing expectations of any swift resolution to this vintage GDPR complaint.Commenting on the ICO’s continued reluctance to take enforcement action against adtech despite mounds of evidence of rampant breaches of the law, Johnny Ryan, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties who was involved in filing the first batch of RTB GDPR complaints — and continues to be a vocal critic of EU regulatory inaction against adtech — told TechCrunch: “It seems to me that the facts are clearly set out in the ICO’s mid 2019 adtech report.Behavioural advertising is out of control, warns UK watchdog“Indeed, that report merely confirms the evidence that accompanied our complaints in September 2018 in Ireland and the UK. It is therefore unclear why the ICO requires several months further. Nor is it clear why the ICO accepted empty gestures from the IAB and Google a year ago.”“I have since published evidence of the impact that failure to enforce has had: Including documented use of RTB data to influence an election,” he added. “As that evidence shows, the scale of the vast data breach caused by the RTB system has increased significantly in the three years since I blew the whistle to the ICO in early 2018.”Ireland’s data watchdog slammed for letting adtech carry on ‘biggest breach of all time’Despite plentiful data on the scale of the personal data leakage involved in RTB, and widespread concern that all sorts of tangible harms are flowing from adtech’s mass surveillance of internet users (from discrimination and societal division to voter manipulation), the ICO is in no rush to enforce.In fact, it quietly closed the 2018 complaint last year — telling the complainants it believed it had investigated the matter “to the extent appropriate”. It’s in the process of being sued by the complainants as a result — for, essentially, doing nothing about their complaint. (The Open Rights Group (ORG), which is involved in that legal action, is running this crowdfunder to raise money to take the ICO to court.)Commenting on the ICO’s resumption of its investigation following the closing of the original complaint, Jim Killock, executive director of ORG, said: “It makes no sense to close complaints, as if they are resolved, and then to carry on investigating the industry. By closing our complaint, the ICO is in effect avoiding their accountability duties to update complainants and resolve their complaints. If the ICO can act in this way, it makes the complaints process hollow.“By wrongfully closing our complaints, the ICO may believe that it has no timescale or need to bring these complaints to a close. We therefore will be continuing to press for resolution through the Tribunal. The case has already been fast-tracked to the Upper-Tribunal, given the importance of the issues involved.”“The ICO has had two and a half years since our complaint,” he added. “The ICO has resumed its policy of issuing threats to the industry, but has yet to make any meaningful enforcement action.”UK’s ICO faces legal action after closing adtech complaint with nothing to show for itSo what does the ICO’s great adtech investigation unpausing mean exactly for the sector?Not much more than gentle notification you might be the recipient of an “assessment notice” at some future point, per the latest mildly worded ICO blog post (and judging by its past performance).Per McDougall, all organizations should be “assessing how they use personal data as a matter of urgency”.He has also committed the ICO to publishing “final findings” at some future point. So — to follow, post-pause — yet another report. And more audits.“We already have existing, comprehensive guidance in this area, which applies to RTB and adtech in the same way it does to other types of processing — particularly in respect of consent,\xa0legitimate interests,\xa0data protection by design\xa0and\xa0data protection impact assessments (DPIAs),” he goes on, eschewing talk of any firmer consequences following should all that guidance continue being roundly ignored by the adtech sector.He ends the post with a nod to the Competition and Markets Authority’s recent investigation of Google’s Privacy Sandbox proposals (to phase out support for third party cookies on Chrome) — saying the ICO is “continuing” to work the CMA on that active antitrust complaint.You’ll have to fill in the blanks as to exactly what work the regulator might be referring to there — because, again, McDougall isn’t saying.If it’s a veiled threat to the adtech industry — to finally “get with the ICO’s privacy program”, or risk not having it fighting adtech’s corner in a crux antitrust versus privacy complaint — it really is gossamer thin.Today, I and (the great) @Caffar3Cristina write in @EURACTIV about antitrust & privacy. Failure by @ICOnews @DPCIreland and others to use powerful GDPR tools has allowed competition problems to fester, putting @CMAgovUK and others in a difficult position. https://t.co/DL842X8UGh— Johnny Ryan (@johnnyryan) January 22, 2021Google’s plan to replace tracking cookies goes under UK antitrust probeThis report was updated with comment from the Open Rights Group']",Cloudflare introduces free digital waiting rooms for any organizations distributing COVID-19 vaccines,"['NavigationClose', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Westend61', 'Getty ImagesThe U.K.’s', 'General Data Protection Regulation', 'GDPR’s', 'RTB', 'the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office', 'Adtech', 'ICO', 'Simon McDougall', 'ICO', 'RTB', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'ICO’s', 'Johnny Ryan', 'the Irish Council for Civil Liberties', 'RTB GDPR', 'EU', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'IAB', 'Google', '”“I', 'RTB', 'RTB', 'ICO', 'RTB', 'ICO', 'The Open Rights Group', 'ICO', 'ICO’s', 'Jim Killock', 'ORG', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'Tribunal', 'Upper-Tribunal', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'ICO', 'RTB', 'the Competition and Markets Authority’s', 'Google’s Privacy Sandbox', 'Chrome', 'ICO', 'McDougall', 'ICO’s', '@EURACTIV', '@ICOnews @DPCIreland', 'GDPR', 'Johnny Ryan', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Lomas1:38', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/EsipKVlIfp,2021-01-22T12:31:02,Apple reportedly planning thinner and lighter MacBook Air with MagSafe charging,"['Apple is said to be working on a new version of the MacBook Air with a brand new physical case design that’s both thinner and lighter than its current offering, which was updated with Apple’s M1 chip late last year, per a new Bloomberg report. The plan is to release it as early as late 2021 or 2022, according to the report’s sources, and it will also include MagSafe charging (which is also said to be returning on Apple’s next MacBook Pro models sometime in 2021).MagSafe would offer power delivery and charging, while two USB 4 ports would provide data connectivity on the new MacBook Air. The display size will remain at its current 13-inch diagonal measurement, but Apple will reportedly realize smaller overall sizes by reducing the bevel that surrounds the screen’s edge, among other sizing changes.Apple has a plan to revamp its entire Mac lineup with its own Apple Silicon processors over the course of the next two years. It debuted its first Apple Silicon Macs, powered by its M1 chip, late last year, and the resulting performance benefits versus their Intel-powered predecessors have been substantial. The physical designs remained essentially the same, however, prompting speculation as to when Apple would introduce new case designs to further distinguish its new Macs from their older models.Apple said to be planning new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros with MagSafe and Apple processorsThe company is also reportedly working on new MacBook Pros with MagSafe charging, which could also ditch the company’s controversial TouchBar interface — and, again according to Bloomberg, bring back a dedicated SD card slot. All these changes would actually be reversions of design changes Apple made when it introduced the current physical notebook Mac designs, beginning with the first Retina display MacBook Pro in 2012, but they address usability complaints by some of the company’s enthusiast and professional customers.']",abrupt call-off of Ant’s public sale,"['Apple', 'MacBook Air', 'MagSafe', 'NavigationClose ScreenApple', 'MacBook Air', 'AppleApple', 'the MacBook Air', 'Apple’s M1', 'MagSafe', 'Apple’s', 'MacBook Air', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple Silicon', 'Apple', 'Intel', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'MacBook Pros', 'MagSafe', 'Apple', 'MacBook Pros', 'MagSafe', 'TouchBar', 'Apple', 'Mac', 'MacBook Pro', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'MacBook Air', 'the MacBook Air', 'Gridware', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/JytsrzJok3,2021-01-22T09:01:20,Privacy complaint targets European parliament’s COVID-19 test-booking site,"['The European Parliament is being investigated by the EU’s lead data regulator over a complaint that a website it set up for MEPs to book coronavirus tests may have violated data protection laws.The complaint, which has been filed by six MEPs and is being supported by the privacy campaign group noyb, alleges third-party trackers were dropped without proper consent and that cookie banners presented to visitors were confusing and deceptively designed.It also alleges personal data was transferred to the U.S. without a valid legal basis, making reference to a landmark legal ruling by Europe’s top court last summer (aka Schrems II).The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), which oversees EU institutions’ compliance with data rules, confirmed receipt of the complaint and said it has begun investigating.It also said the “litigious cookies” had been disabled following the complaints, adding that the parliament told it no user data had in fact been transferred outside the EU.“A complaint was indeed filed by some MEPs about the European Parliament’s coronavirus testing website; the EDPS has started investigating it in accordance with Article 57(1)(e) EUDPR (GDPR for EU institutions),” an EDPS spokesman told TechCrunch. “Following this complaint, the Data Protection Office of the European Parliament informed the EDPS that the litigious cookies were now disabled on the website and confirmed that no user data was sent to outside the European Union.”“The EDPS is currently assessing this website to ensure compliance with EUDPR requirements. EDPS findings will be communicated to the controller and complainants in due course,” it added.MEP, Alexandra Geese, of Germany’s Greens, filed an initial complaint with the EDPS on behalf of other parliamentarians.Two of the MEPs that have joined the complaint and are making their names public are Patrick Breyer and Mikuláš Peksa — both members of the Pirate Party, in Germany and the Czech Republic respectively.We’ve reached out to the European Parliament and the company it used to supply the testing website for comment. Update: The European Parliament Press Service has now sent this statement:The contract signed between the Parliament and EcoLog contains appropriate rules on data protection. According to those rules, the processing of personal data by EcoLog on behalf of the Parliament is subject to the Data Protection Regulation applicable to the Institutions of the European Union (Regulation No 2018/1725). EcoLog agreed to comply with all its obligations deriving from that data protection Regulation.The EP administration, aware of some MEPs concerns last autumn, contacted immediately EcoLog and double-check the data was processed according to the regulation. Accordingly, based on the investigations carried out by the Parliament and the information provided by the company, no personal data of MEPs and EP staff members registering for testing was transferred outside the EU.The European Parliament has not received any formal notification of an investigation by EDPS.The complaint is noteworthy for a couple of reasons. Firstly because the allegations of a failure to uphold regional data protection rules look pretty embarrassing for an EU institution. Data protection may also feel especially important for “politically exposed persons like Members and staff of the European Parliament”, as noyb puts it.Back in 2019 the European Parliament was also sanctioned by the EDPS over use of a U.S.-based digital campaign company, NationBuilder, to process citizens’ voter data ahead of the spring elections — in the regulator’s first-ever such enforcement of an EU institution.So it’s not the first time the parliament has gotten in hot water over its attention to detail vis-à-vis third-party data processors (the parliament’s COVID-19 test registration website is being provided by a German company called Ecolog Deutschland GmbH). Once may be an oversight, twice starts to look sloppy…European parliament’s NationBuilder contract under investigation by data regulatorSecondly, the complaint could offer a relatively quick route for a referral to the EU’s top court, the CJEU, to further clarify interpretation of Schrems II — a ruling that has implications for thousands of businesses involved in transferring personal data out of the EU — should there be a follow-on challenge to a decision by the EDPS.“The decisions of the EDPS can be directly challenged before the Court of Justice of the EU,” noyb notes in a press release. “This means that the appeal can be brought directly to the highest court of the EU, in charge of the uniform interpretation of EU law. This is especially interesting as noyb is working on multiple other cases raising similar issues before national DPAs.”Guidance for businesses involved in transferring data out of the EU who are trying to understand how to (or often whether they can) be compliant with data protection law, post-Schrems II, is so far limited to what EU regulators have put out.Further interpretation by the CJEU could bring more clarifying light — and, indeed, less wiggle room for processors wanting to keep schlepping Europeans’ data over the pond legally, depending on how the cookie crumbles (if you’ll pardon the pun).Additionally, noyb notes that the complaint asks the EDPS to prohibit transfers that violate EU law.“Public authorities, and in particular the EU institutions, have to lead by example to comply with the law,” said Max Schrems, honorary chairman of noyb, in a statement. “This is also true when it comes to transfers of data outside of the EU. By using US providers, the European Parliament enabled the NSA to access data of its staff and its members.”Per the complaint, concerns about third-party trackers and data transfers were initially raised to the parliament last October — after an MEP used a tracker-scanning tool to analyze the COVID-19 test-booking website and found a total of 150 third-party requests and a cookie were placed on her browser.Specifically, the EcoCare COVID-19 testing-registration website was found to drop a cookie from the U.S.-based company Stripe, as well as including many more third-party requests from Google and Stripe.The complaint also notes that a data protection notice on the site informed users that data on their usage generated by the use of Google Analytics is “transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the US”.Where consent was concerned, the site was found to serve users with two different conflicting data protection notices — with one containing a (presumably copy/pasted) reference to Brussels Airport.Different consent flows were also presented, depending on the user’s region, with some visitors being offered no clear opt-out button. The cookie notices were also found to contain a “dark pattern” nudge toward a bright green button to “Accept all” processing, as well as confusing wording for unclear alternatives.A screengrab of the cookie consent prompt that the parliament’s COVID-19 test-booking website displayed at the time of writing — with still no clearly apparent opt-out for non-essential cookies (Image credit: TechCrunch)The EU has stringent requirements for (legally) gathering consents for (non-essential) cookies and other third-party tracking technologies, which states that consent must be clearly informed, specific and freely given.In 2019, Europe’s top court further confirmed that consent must be obtained prior to dropping non-essential trackers. (Health-related data also generally carries a higher consent-bar to process legally in the EU, although in this case the personal information relates to appointment registrations rather than special category medical data.)The complaints allege that EU cookie consent requirements are not being met on the website.While the presence of requests for U.S.-based services (and the reference to storing data in the U.S.) is a legal problem in light of the Schrems II judgement.The U.S. no longer enjoys legally frictionless flows of personal data out of the EU after the CJEU torpedoed the adequacy arrangement the Commission had granted (invalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield mechanism) — which in turn means transfers of data on EU peoples to U.S.-based companies are complicated.Data controllers are responsible for assessing each such proposed transfer, on a case by case basis. A data transfer mechanism called Standard Contractual Clauses was not invalidated by the CJEU. But the court made it clear SCCs can only be used for transfers to third countries where data protection is essentially equivalent to the legal regime offered in the EU — doing so at the same time as saying the U.S. does not meet that standard.Guidance from the European Data Protection Board in the wake of the ruling suggests that some EU-U.S. data transfers may be possible to carry in compliance with European law. Such as those that involve encrypted data with no access by the receiving U.S.-based entity.However, the bar for compliance varies depending on the specific context and case.Additionally, for a subset of companies that are definitely subject to U.S. surveillance law (such as Google) the compliance bar may be impossibly high — as surveillance law is the main legal sticking point for EU-U.S. transfers.So, once again, it’s not a good look for the parliament website to have had a notice on its COVID-19 testing website that said personal data would be transferred to a Google server in the U.S. (Even if that functionality had not been activated, as seems to have been claimed.)Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that’s cold comfort for FacebookAnother reason the complaint against the European Parliament is noteworthy is that it further highlights how much web infrastructure in use within Europe could be risking legal sanction for failing to comply with regional data protection rules. If the European Parliament can’t get it right, who is?Indeed, noyb filed a raft of complaints against EU websites last year, which it had identified still sending data to the U.S. via Google Analytics and/or Facebook Connect integrations a short while after the Schrems II ruling. (Those complaints are being looked into by DPAs across the EU.)Facebook’s EU data transfers are also very much on the hook here. Earlier this month the tech giant’s lead EU data regulator agreed to “swiftly resolve” a long-standing complaint over its transfers.Schrems filed that complaint all the way back in 2013. He told us he expects the case to be resolved this year, likely within around six to nine months. So a final decision should come in 2021.He has previously suggested the only way for Facebook to fix the data transfers issue is to federate its service, storing European users’ data locally. While last year the tech giant was forced to deny it would shut its service in Europe if its lead EU regulator followed through on enforcing a preliminary order to suspend transfers (which it blocked by applying for a judicial review of the Irish DPC’s processes).The alternative outcome Facebook has been lobbying for is some kind of a political resolution to the legal uncertainty clouding EU-U.S. data transfers. However the European Commission has warned there’s no quick fix — and reform of U.S. surveillance law is needed.So with options for continued icing of EU data protection enforcement against U.S. tech giants melting fast in the face of bar-setting CJEU rulings and ongoing strategic litigation like this latest noyb-supported complaint, pressure is only going to keep building for pro-privacy reform of U.S. surveillance law. Not that Facebook has openly come out in support of reforming FISA yet.Max Schrems on the EU court ruling that could cut Facebook in two']",JustKitchen,"['NavigationClose ScreenPrivacy', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Wiertz', 'Flickr', 'The European Parliament', 'EU', 'II).The European Data Protection', 'EU', 'EU.“A', 'the European Parliament’s', 'EU', 'the Data Protection Office', 'the European Parliament', 'the European Union', 'MEP', 'Alexandra Geese', 'Patrick Breyer', 'Mikuláš Peksa', 'the Pirate Party', 'the European Parliament', 'The European Parliament Press Service', 'Parliament', 'EcoLog', 'Parliament', 'the Data Protection Regulation', 'the European Union (Regulation', 'EP', 'Parliament', 'EP', 'the EU.The European Parliament', 'EU', 'the European Parliament', 'the European Parliament', 'EDPS', 'NationBuilder', 'EU', 'Ecolog Deutschland GmbH', 'NationBuilder', 'CJEU', 'Schrems II', 'EU', 'the Court of Justice', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'post-Schrems II', 'EU', 'CJEU', 'Europeans’', 'EU', 'EU', 'Max Schrems', 'EU', 'the European Parliament', 'NSA', 'MEP', 'EcoCare', 'Google Analytics', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'CJEU', 'Commission', 'EU', 'EU', 'CJEU', 'EU', 'the European Data Protection Board', 'EU', 'EU', 'COVID-19', 'FacebookAnother', 'the European Parliament', 'the European Parliament', 'EU', 'Google Analytics', 'Schrems II', 'EU', 'EU', 'the Irish DPC’s', 'EU', 'the European Commission', 'EU', 'CJEU', 'Max Schrems', 'EU', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropePrivacyTCcookie consentCOVID-19data', '2021The European Parliament', 'EU', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

China’s ride-hailing leader Didi Chuxing is pledging a $10 million fund to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts in 13 markets outside its home country China, the company said on Friday.The multi-purpose fund will be used to reduce fees for passengers going to vaccination appointments and frontline healthcare workers traveling to vaccination locations. It will also sponsor future measures based on a market’s local needs, Didi said, adding that it will continue working with the respective governments.It’s still unclear how the company plans to allocate the funds across the dozens of markets, which are Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Argentina, Australia, Japan, Russia and New Zealand.“We will share more details locally as vaccinations roll out and our local support plans are finalized,” said a spokesperson for the company.Like other tech firms, Didi has responded swiftly to the COVID-19 outbreak by offering relief measures. It said it has so far funded more than six million free or discounted rides and meals for frontline healthcare workers and distributed more than six million masks and sanitation kits to driver and courier partners in its international markets.In China, the ride hailing company has made similar efforts, including financial assistance like insurance plans for drivers with confirmed cases or those undergoing quarantine.“The vaccination support initiative is a crucial step in our local recovery effort across the world,” said Jean Liu, president of Didi.Cloudflare introduces free digital waiting rooms for any organizations distributing COVID-19 vaccines“The incredible commitment and agility of Didi teams, together with a safety system built for complex mobility scenarios, play a critical role in protecting our people and ensuring essential services throughout these challenging times. We will continue to stand by our partners and communities to get our cities moving again.”To ensure passenger and driver safety, the company rolled out a mask detection technology last year for in-car cameras across China and some of its overseas markets.The SoftBank-backed company took a hit when it temporarily suspended its popular and lucrative carpooling service following two passenger incidents in 2018. The startup remains one of China’s most valuable private tech companies and rumors have swirled for a few years that it is planning an initial public offering, which the company has denied.In all, Didi has garnered over 550 million users across the Asia Pacific, Latin America and Russia by offering taxi hailing, private car hailing, rideshare, buses, bikes and e-bikes, and it enables more than 10 billion passenger trips a year as of late. Outside China, it has over 20 million users and 2.8 million drivers and couriers.The company has a nascent autonomous driving arm backed by SoftBank and is among a group of Chinese upstart AI companies aggressively developing and testing autonomous vehicles.

https://t.co/5k0SYjTh4D,2021-01-22T07:25:13,"China’s draft payments rules put Ant, Tencent on notice","['A string of recent events in China’s payments industry suggests the duopoly comprising Ant Group and Tencent may be getting a shakeup.Following the abrupt call-off of Ant’s public sale and a government directive to reform the firm’s business, the Chinese authorities sent another message this week signaling plans to curb concentration in the flourishing digital payments industry.The set of draft rules, designed to regulate non-bank payments and released by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) this week, said any non-bank payments processor with over one-third of the non-bank payments market or two companies with a combined half of the market could be subject to regulatory warnings from the anti-monopoly authority under the State Council.Meanwhile, a single non-bank payments provider with over one half of the digital payments market or two companies with a combined two-thirds of the market could be investigated for whether they constitute a monopoly.The difference between the two rules is nuanced here, with the second stipulation focusing on digital payments as opposed to non-bank payments\xa0in the first.Furthermore, the rules did not specify how authorities measure an organization’s market share, say, whether the judgment is based on an entity’s total transaction value, its transaction volume or other metrics.Alipay processed over half of China’s third-party payments transactions in the first quarter of 2020, according to market researcher iResearch, while Tencent handled nearly 40% of the payments in the same period.The race to be China’s top fintech platform: Ant vs TencentAs China heightens scrutiny over its payments giants, it’s also opening up the financial market to international players. In December, Goldman Sachs moved to take full ownership of its Chinese joint venture. This month, PayPal\xa0became the first foreign company with 100% control of a payments business in China after it bought out the remaining stake in its local payments partner Guofubao.Industry experts told TechCrunch that PayPal won’t likely go after the domestic payments giants but may instead explore opportunities in cross-border payments, a market with established players like XTransfer, which was founded by a team of Ant veterans.Ant and Tencent also face competition from other Chinese internet firms. Companies ranging from food delivery platform Meituan and e-commerce platforms Pinduoduo and JD.com to TikTok’s parent firm ByteDance have introduced their own e-wallets, though none of them have posed an imminent threat to Alipay or WeChat Pay.The comprehensive proposal from PBOC also defines how payments processors handle customer data. Non-bank payments services are to store certain user information and transaction history and cooperate with relevant authorities on data checks. Companies are also required to obtain user consent and make clear to customers how their data are collected and used, a rule that reflects China’s broader effort to clamp down on unscrupulous data collection.China proposes antitrust law ahead of Singles’ Day shopping spree']",VSPN,"['Ant, Tencent', 'NavigationClose', 'Ant, Tencent on noticeRita', 'Alipay', 'Ant Group', 'Ant’s', 'the People’s Bank of China', 'the State Council', 'Alipay', 'iResearch', 'Ant', 'Goldman Sachs', 'PayPal', 'Guofubao', 'PayPal', 'XTransfer', 'Ant', 'Ant and Tencent', 'TikTok’s', 'Alipay', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Ant, Tencent', 'Ant Group', 'Ant’s', 'Gridware', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Tl29kdGBwx,2021-01-22T06:23:41,JustKitchen is using cloud kitchens to create the next generation of restaurant franchising,"['JustKitchen operates cloud kitchens, but the company goes beyond providing cooking facilities for delivery meals. Instead, it sees food as a content play, with recipes and branding instead of music or shows as the content, and wants to create the next iteration of food franchises. JustKitchen currently operates its “hub and spoke” model in Taiwan, with plans to expand four other Asian markets, including Hong Kong and Singapore, and the United States this year.Launched last year, JustKitchen currently offers 14 brands in Taiwan, including Smith & Wollensky and TGI Fridays. Ingredients are first prepped in a “hub” kitchen, before being sent to smaller “spokes” for final assembly and pickup by delivery partners, including Uber Eats and Foodpanda. To reduce operational costs, spokes are spread throughout cities for quicker deliveries and the brands each prepares is based on what is ordered most frequently in the area.In addition to licensing deals, JustKitchen also develops its own brands and performs research and development for its partners. To enable that, chief operating officer Kenneth Wu told TechCrunch that JustKitchen is moving to a more decentralized model, which means its hub kitchens will be used primarily for R&D, and production at some of its spoke kitchens will be outsourced to other food vendors and manufacturers. The company’s long-term plan is to license spoke operation to franchisees, while providing order management software and content (i.e. recipes, packaging and branding) to maintain consistent quality.Demand for meal and grocery deliveries increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United States, this means food deliveries made up about 13% of the restaurant market in 2020, compared to the 9% forecast before the pandemic, according to research firm Statista, and may rise to 21% by 2025.But on-demand food delivery businesses are notoriously expensive to operate, with low margins despite markups and fees. By centralizing food preparation and pickup, cloud kitchens (also called ghost kitchens or dark kitchens) are supposed to increase profitability while ensuring standardized quality. Not surprisingly, companies in the space have received significant attention, including former Uber chief executive officer Travis Kalanick’s CloudKitchens, Kitchen United and REEF, which recently raised $1 billion led by SoftBank.The hidden cost of food deliveryWu, whose food delivery startup Milk and Eggs was acquired by GrubHub in 2019, said one of the main ways JustKitchen differentiates is by focusing on operations and content in addition to kitchen infrastructure. Before partnering with restaurants and other brands, JustKitchen meets with them to design a menu specifically for takeout and delivery. Once a menu is launched, it is produced by JustKitchen instead of the brands, which are paid royalties. For restaurants that operate only one brick-and-mortar location, this gives them an opportunity to expand into multiple neighborhoods and cities (or countries, when JustKitchen begins its international expansion) simultaneously, a new take on the franchising model for the on-demand delivery era.One of JustKitchen’s delivery meals. Image Credits: JustKitchenEach spoke kitchen puts the final touches on meals before handing them to delivery partners. Spoke kitchens are smaller than hubs, closer to customers, and the goal is to have a high revenue to square footage ratio.“The thesis in general is how do you get economies of scale or a large volume at the hub, or the central kitchen where you’re making it, and then send it out deep into the community from the spokes, where they can do a short last-mile delivery,” said Wu.JustKitchen says it can cut industry standard delivery times by half, and that its restaurant partners have seen 40% month on month growth. It also makes it easier for delivery providers like Uber Eats to stack orders, which means having a driver pick up three or four orders at a time for separate addresses. This reduces costs, but is usually only possible at high-volume restaurants, like fast food chain locations. Since JustKitchen offers several brands in one spoke, this gives delivery platforms more opportunities to stack orders from different brands.In addition to partnerships, JustKitchen also develops its own food brands, using data analytics from several sources to predict demand. The first source is its own platform, since customers can order directly from Just Kitchen. It also gets high-level data from delivery partners that lets them see food preferences and cart sizes in different regions, and uses general demographic data from governments and third-party providers with information about population density, age groups, average income and spending. This allows it to plan what brands to launch in different locations and during different times of the day, since JustKitchen offers breakfast, lunch and dinner.JustKitchen is incorporated in Canada, but launched in Taiwan first because of its population density and food delivery’s popularity. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, food delivery penetration in the U.S. and Europe was below 20%, but in Taiwan, it was already around 30% to 40%, Wu said. The new demand for food delivery in the U.S. “is part of the new norm and we believe that is not going away,” he added. JustKitchen is preparing to launch in Seattle and several Californian cities, where it already has partners and kitchen infrastructure.“Our goal is to focus on software and content, and give franchisees operations so they have a turnkey franchise to launch immediately,” said Wu. “We have the content and they can pick whatever they want. They have software to integrate, recipes and we do the food manufacturing and sourcing to control quality, and ultimately they will operate the single location.”REEF Technology raises $700M from SoftBank and others to remake parking lots']",beam high-speed internet,"['JustKitchen', 'NavigationClose', 'Shu@catherineshu', 'JustKitchen', 'JustKitchen', 'Smith & Wollensky', 'Uber Eats', 'Foodpanda', 'JustKitchen', 'Kenneth Wu', 'JustKitchen', 'Statista', 'Uber', 'Travis Kalanick’s', 'CloudKitchens', 'Kitchen United', 'REEF', 'SoftBank', 'GrubHub', 'JustKitchen', 'JustKitchen', 'Spoke', 'Wu', 'JustKitchen', 'Uber Eats', 'JustKitchen', 'JustKitchen', 'JustKitchen', 'JustKitchen', 'Wu', 'JustKitchen', 'Californian', 'Wu', 'SoftBank', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Waste carbon dioxide emitted at a refinery or factory is captured at the source and then stored in an aim to remove the potential harmful byproduct from the environment and mitigate climate change. It’s not a new pursuit and numerous companies have popped up over the past two decades with varying means of achieving the same end goal.The high upfront cost to carbon capture and storage or sequestration (CCS) has been a primary hurdle for the technology. However, there are companies that have found promise in carbon capture and utilization — a cousin to CCS in which the collected emissions are then converted to other more valuable uses.For instance, LanzaTech has developed technology that\xa0captures waste gas emissions and uses bacteria to turn it into useable ethanol fuel. A bioreactor is used to convert into liquids captured and compressed waste emissions from a steel mill or factory or any other emissions-producing enterprises. The core technology of LanzaTech is a bacteria that likes to eat these dirty gas streams. As the bacteria eats the emissions it essentially ferments them and emits ethanol. The ethanol can then be turned into various products. LanzaTech is spinning off businesses that specialize in a different product. The company has created a spin-off called LanzaJet and is working on other possible products such as converting ethanol to ethylene, which is used to make polyethylene for bottles and PEP for fibers used to make clothes.LanzaJet launches to make renewable jet fuel a realityOther examples include Climeworks and Carbon Engineering.Climeworks, a Swiss startup, specializes in direct air capture.

https://t.co/pOy4BVTJfB,2021-01-22T00:42:10,Alphabet shuts down Loon internet balloon company,"['Google’s parent firm, Alphabet, is done exploring the idea of using a fleet of balloons to beam high-speed internet in remote parts of the world.The firm said on Thursday evening that it was winding down Loon, a nine-year-old project and a two-and-a-half-year-old spin-off firm, after failing to find a sustainable business model and partners for one of its most prominent moonshot projects.The demise of Loon, which assumed the spotlight after the project helped restore cell services knocked out by a hurricane in Puerto Rico,\xa0comes a year after the Android-maker ended Google Station, its other major connectivity effort to bring internet to the next billion users.Google ends its free Wi-Fi program StationThrough Station, Google provided internet connectivity at over 400 railway stations in India and sought to replicate the model in other public places in more nations.That said, Alphabet’s move today is still surprising. Just last year, Loon had secured approval from the government of Kenya to launch balloons to provide commercial connectivity services — something it did successfully achieve months later, giving an impression that things were moving in the right direction.Loon, which raised $125 million from a SoftBank unit in 2019, has long stated its mission as: “Loon is focused on bringing connectivity to unserved and underserved communities around the world. We are in discussions with telecommunications companies and governments worldwide to provide a solution to help extend internet connectivity to these underserved areas.”Perhaps the growing interest of SpaceX and Amazon in this space influenced Alphabet’s decision — if not, the two firms are also going to have to confront some difficult feasibility questions in the future.SpaceX snags $885M from FCC to serve rural areas with Starlink“We talk a lot about connecting the next billion users, but the reality is Loon has been chasing the hardest problem of all in connectivity — the last billion users,” wrote Alastair Westgarth, chief executive of Loon, in a blog post.“The communities in areas too difficult or remote to reach, or the areas where delivering service with existing technologies is just too expensive for everyday people. While we’ve found a number of willing partners along the way, we haven’t found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business. Developing radical new technology is inherently risky, but that doesn’t make breaking this news any easier.”The blog post characterised Loon’s connectivity effort as a success.“The Loon team is proud to have catalyzed an ecosystem of organizations working on providing connectivity from the stratosphere. The world needs a layered approach to connectivity — terrestrial, stratospheric, and space-based — because each layer is suited to different parts of the problem. In this area, Loon has made a number of important technical contributions,” wrote Westgarth.What happens nextIn a separate blog post, the firm said it had pledged a fund of $10 million to support nonprofits and businesses focused on connectivity, internet, entrepreneurship and education in Kenya.Alphabet also plans to take some of Loon’s technology forward and share what it learned from this moonshot idea with others.Amazon gains FCC approval for Kuiper internet satellite constellation and commits $10 billion to the projectAdditionally, “some of Loon’s technology — like the high bandwidth (20Gbps+) optical communication links that were first used to beam a connection between balloons\xa0bopping in the stratosphere — already lives on in\xa0Project Taara. This team is currently\xa0working with partners in Sub-Saharan Africa to bring affordable, high-speed internet to unconnected and under-connected communities starting in Kenya,” the firm said.Scores of firms, including Google and Facebook, have visibly scaled down several of their connectivity efforts in recent years after many developing nations such as India that they targeted solved their internet problems on their own.It has also become clear that subsidizing internet access to hundreds of millions of potential users is perhaps not the most sustainable way to acquire customers.']",developing a standalone virtual reality headset,"['Loon', 'NavigationClose ScreenAlphabet', 'Loon', 'LoonGoogle’s', 'Loon', 'Loon', 'Android', 'Google Station', 'StationThrough Station', 'Loon', 'Loon', 'SoftBank', 'Loon', 'Amazon', 'FCC', 'Loon', 'Alastair Westgarth', 'Loon', '’ve', 'Loon', 'Loon', 'Loon', 'Loon’s', 'Amazon', 'FCC', 'Kuiper', 'Loon’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Loon', 'Singh1:42 AM', 'Gridware', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/EuJxE2dj21,2021-01-21T23:37:46,"Hims, the telehealth startup, saw its shares slip in their trading debut — and that’s fine with its CEO","['Hims & Hers, a San Francisco-based telehealth startup that sells sexual wellness and other health products and services to millennials, began trading publicly today on the NYSE after completing a reverse merger with the blank-check company Oaktree Acquisition Corp.Its shares slipped a bit, ending the day down 5% from where they started, but the company, which was founded in 2017 and now claims nearly 300,000 paying subscribers for its various offerings, has never been focused on a splashy headline about its first-day performance, co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum told us earlier today.On the contrary, Dudum says that while Hims might have once imagined a traditional IPO, it decided to go the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) route because of their pricing mechanisms and because it was approached by a SPAC led by renowned money manager Howard Marks, the founder of the global alternative investment firm Oaktree Capital Management. (“We fell in love with the Oaktree team and the capital market experience and deep resources they have.”)We talked with Dudum about that SPAC’s structure; the lockups involved now that Hims’ shares are trading; and how much of the business still centers around one of its first offerings, which was a generic version of erectile dysfunction pills. Our conversation has been edited lightly for length and clarity.TC: You’re a Bay Area-based company selling to a mostly U.S. audience. How are you thinking about expanding that footprint geographically?AD: We do have a small operation selling in the U.K.; we’re getting our feet wet in that market and building out a team and infrastructure and fulfillment. If you look at the regulatory landscape, there’s a huge amount of room [to grow] in Europe, Australia, Canada, the Middle East and Asia, and so in that order, we’ll start to [move into those markets].TC: What is your average customer cost?\xa0AD: It has come down from $200 when we first launched, to roughly $100 last year, and we make, on average, close to $300 in the first couple of years of a patient’s lifetime value.TC: How quickly do customers churn?AD: We break down lifetime value projections by quarter cohorts, and quarter over quarter, year over year, we’re monetizing each of these cohorts better, with higher-margin profiles.As of last quarter, the business was growing 90% year-over-year, with 76% gross margins and greater cash efficiency, and that’s because as we provide more offerings, there is more cross-purchasing. Also, word of mouth is becoming more of a dynamic, with more than 50% of the traffic to the site free at this point because we have built a brand with a young demographic.TC: When are you projecting that you’ll turn profitable?AD: We’ve reduced our annual burn and increased our margin efficiency and organic growth, so on a quarterly basis, we think in the next couple of years is a real possibility.Image Credits: Hims & HersTC: Hims’ first wellness offerings included pills for male pattern hair loss and erectile dysfunction. How much revenue does that ED business account for?AD: What we’ve disclosed is that roughly half [of our revenue] is that sexual health category — which includes [medicines for] generic erectile dysfunction, birth control, STDs, UTIs and premature ejaculation. The other half is predominately dermatology, including hair care [to address hair loss] and acne, and we’ve more recently moved into primary care and behavioral health.TC: For retail investors, how do you differentiate the business from that of your rival Ro, which heavily promotes its ED products?AD: There are a number of core differences between us and public and private players. First is our real focus on diversifying our offerings. With our focus on sexual health, dermatology, primary care and behavioral health, it’s in our DNA to quickly expand into new businesses.We also think we’re different from most [rivals] in that we really invest time in building deep relationships with [those who represent] the future of healthcare markets — people in their teens, 20s and 30s. This demographic has a different set of tech expectations and consumer expectations than people in their 40s, 50s and 60s, and if we want to build for the future, that means building for the largest body of payers in the future.Hims launches group therapy services as first foray into broader mental health initiativeTraditional healthcare companies monetize only the sick, but optimizing around that demographic precludes you from understanding what the next generation really needs and wants. I’ve never seen such a divergence between a patient population and legacy experience, and that’s a real advantage to us as a business.TC: Hims just went public through a SPAC in a deal that gives the company around $280 million in cash — $205 million of that from Oaktree’s blank-check company and another $75 million through a private placement deal. How much runway does that give you?AD: The company doesn’t burn a tremendous amount — between $10 million and $20 million a year — so a relatively long runway if we keep operating the business as is. But it does allow us to expand and grow into new businesses, too, including into big categories like sleep, infertility, diabetes and other chronic conditions.TC: What about acquisitions?AD: We’ll keep an eye open for strategic opportunities and consolidation opportunities. More than a dozen businesses a month come to us to be consolidated into the brand, but generally speaking, we’ve had the belief that so much is in front of us that we don’t want to be distracted.TC: Is there a lockup period for anyone?AD: There’s a traditional lockup for executives and employees and the board.TC: Did your SPAC sponsors get a board seat?AD: No.TC: How much do they now own of the company, and can they sell?AD: Oaktree owns a couple percent and [the syndicate they brought to do the private placement] [owns] 12%. But the very reason we went with them was the quality of the team and the organization . . . and they have the added incentive for the next year or two from a compensation standpoint for the company to succeed and to prove [out their thesis that Hims is a smart investment].TC: Do you think the traditional IPO process is broken?AD: The traditional IPO market hasn’t changed. It takes 12 to 18 months of preparation, which is a crazy amount of time for management to be distracted, then there’s this one-day PIPE that gives institutions a tremendous amount of money instantaneously. Maybe it makes for a good CNBC headline, but at tremendous cost to the company. It’s atrocious. If you were a founder or employee and getting diluted twice as much as you have to be, you’d be really upset. It’s no surprise to me that founders like myself are looking at other modalities with better pricing and better structures.Almost everything you need to know about SPACs']",painted a picture of a company,"['NavigationClose', 'CEOConnie Loizos@cookie / 12:37 AM', 'Hims & HersHims & Hers', 'NYSE', 'Oaktree Acquisition Corp.', 'Andrew Dudum', 'Dudum', 'Howard Marks', 'Oaktree Capital Management', 'Dudum', 'Hims’', 'Hims & HersTC', 'Ro', 'ED', 'Oaktree’s', '’ve', 'CNBC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'DudumErectile DysfunctionHims & HersHoward Marksinitial', 'CEOConnie', '2021Hims & Hers', 'NYSE', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/FmMb98Fuym,2021-01-21T22:43:00,IBM transformation struggles continue with cloud and AI revenue down 4.5%,"['A couple of months ago at CNBC’s Transform conference, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna painted a picture of a company in the midst of a transformation. He said that he wanted to take advantage of IBM’s $34 billion 2018 Red Hat acquisition to help customers manage a growing hybrid cloud world, while using artificial intelligence to drive efficiency.It seems like a sound enough approach. But instead of the new strategy acting as a big growth engine, IBM’s earnings today showed that its cloud and cognitive software revenues were down 4.5% to $6.8 billion. Meanwhile cognitive applications — where you find AI incomes — were flat.If Krishna was looking for a silver lining, perhaps he could take solace in the fact that Red Hat itself performed well, with revenue up 18% compared to the year-ago period, according to the company. But overall the company’s revenue declined for the fourth straight quarter, leaving the executive in much the same position as his predecessor Ginni Rometty, who led IBM during 22 straight quarters of revenue losses.Incoming IBM CEO Arvind Krishna faces monumental challenges on multiple frontsKrishna laid out his strategy in November, telling CNBC, “The Red Hat acquisition gave us the technology base on which to build a hybrid cloud technology platform based on open-source, and based on giving choice to our clients as they embark on this journey.” So far the approach is simply not generating the growth Krishna expected.The company is also in the midst of spinning out its legacy managed infrastructure services division, which, as Krishna said in the same November interview, should allow Big Blue to concentrate more on its new strategy. “With the success of that acquisition now giving us the fuel, we can then take the next step, and the larger step, of taking the managed infrastructure services out. So the rest of the company can be absolutely focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence,” he said.While it’s certainly too soon to say his transformation strategy has failed, the results aren’t there yet, and IBM’s falling top line has to be as frustrating to Krishna as it was to Rometty. If you guide the company toward more modern technologies and away from the legacy ones, at some point you should start seeing results, but so far that has not been the case for either leader.Krishna continued to build on this vision at the end of last year by buying some additional pieces like cloud applications performance monitoring company Instana and hybrid cloud consulting firm Nordcloud. He did so to build a broader portfolio of hybrid cloud services to make IBM more of a one-stop shop for these services.As retired NFL football coach Bill Parcells used to say, referring to his poorly performing teams, “you are what your record says you are.” Right now IBM’s record continues to trend in the wrong direction. While it’s making some gains with Red Hat leading the way, it’s simply not enough to offset the losses, and something needs to change.Ginni Rometty leaves complex legacy as she steps away as IBM CEO']",Solugen,"['IBM', 'AI', 'NavigationClose', 'AI', 'CNBC', 'IBM', 'Arvind Krishna', 'IBM', 'Red Hat', 'IBM', 'AI', 'Krishna', 'Red Hat', 'Ginni Rometty', 'IBM', 'IBM', 'Arvind Krishna', 'CNBC', 'Krishna', 'Big Blue', 'IBM', 'Instana', 'Nordcloud', 'IBM', 'NFL', 'Bill Parcells', 'IBM’s', 'Red Hat', 'Ginni Rometty', 'IBM', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'KrishnaEnterprisehybrid', 'AI', 'CNBC', 'IBM', 'Arvind Krishna', 'IBM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/3lqSl75zuu,2021-01-21T22:28:41,Judge denies Parler’s bid to make Amazon restore service,"[""A federal judge has denied an attempt by conservative social network Parler to force Amazon to host it on AWS. As expected by most who read Parler’s ramshackle legal arguments, the court found nothing in the lawsuit that could justify intervention, only “faint and factually inaccurate speculation.”In the order, filed in the Western Washington U.S. District Court, Judge Barbara Rothstein explained how little Parler actually brought to the table to support its allegations that Amazon and Twitter were engaged in antitrust collusion and that AWS had broken its contract.Parler sues Amazon, leveling far-fetched antitrust allegationsOn the question of antitrust, Parler fell far short of demonstrating anything at all, let alone collusion in breach of the Sherman Act.The evidence it has submitted in support of the claim is both dwindlingly slight, and disputed by AWS. Importantly, Parler has submitted no evidence that AWS and Twitter acted together intentionally — or even at all — in restraint of trade.… Indeed, Parler has failed to do more than raise the specter of preferential treatment of Twitter by AWS.Amazon had explained in its filing that not only does AWS not even host Twitter yet, though there are plans to do so, but that there are strict rules in place to prevent discussing one client with another. This was more than enough to dispute Parler’s flimsy claim, Rothstein noted.On breach of contract, Parler had in the course of its argument essentially admitted to breach of contract on its end, but said that Amazon had broken its side of the bargain by not giving it 30 days to fix the problem as stipulated in the customer service agreement (CSA) at Section 7.2(b)(i). Turns out that doesn’t even matter:Parler fails to acknowledge, let alone dispute, that Section 7.2(b)(ii) — the provision immediately following — authorizes AWS to terminate the Agreement “immediately upon notice” and without providing any opportunity to cure …So the 30-day agreement was never in play if Amazon didn’t want it to be; one imagines that the clause is for less immediately concerning causes for action. Contract breach argument denied.Parler’s allegation that Amazon was “motivated by political animus” likewise holds no water, according to the judge.Parler has failed to allege basic facts that would support several elements of this claim. Most fatally, as discussed above, it has failed to raise more than the scantest speculation that AWS’s actions were taken for an improper purpose or by improper means … To the contrary, the evidence at this point suggests that AWS’s termination of the CSA was in response to Parler’s material breach.The company also made the argument that it would suffer “irreparable harm” if AWS services were not restored, and in fact Rothstein had no reason to doubt Parler’s claims that it may face “extinction” as a result of these circumstances. Except that “Parler’s claims to irreparable harm are substantially diminished by its admission ‘that much of that harm would be compensable by damages.'”In other words, money would fix it — which means it isn’t exactly irreparable.On other legalities and technicalities, Rothstein finds that Parler makes no case or that Amazon’s case is much stronger — for instance, that being forced to host violent and hateful content would damage AWS’s reputation, perhaps even irreparably.As is important to note in cases like this, the judge is not ruling on the merits of the whole case, only on the arguments and evidence presented in the request for an injunction to restore services while the case proceeds.“To be clear, the Court is not dismissing Parler’s substantive underlying claims at this time” — which is to say that it is not dismissing the substance of the claims, nor asserting that they have substance. But Parler “has fallen far short” of demonstrating what it needs to in order to justify a legal intervention of that type.The case will proceed to its next date, if indeed Parler has not faced the “extinction” it warned of by then.Rothstein Order on Parler i… by TechCrunch""]",Mignon Clyburn,"['Parler’s', 'Amazon', 'NavigationClose', 'Parler’s', 'Amazon', 'Coldewey@techcrunch / 11:28 PM', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Parler’s', 'District Court', 'Barbara Rothstein', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'AWS.Amazon', 'Parler’s', 'Rothstein', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'CSA', 'Amazon', 'Parler’s', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'CSA', 'Parler’s', 'Rothstein', 'Parler’s', 'Rothstein', 'Parler', 'Amazon’s', 'Court', 'Parler’s', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Rothstein Order', 'Parler', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Parler’s', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Parler’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/vP7fhfMrdP,2021-01-21T22:28:04,"Pebble founder launches Beeper, a universal chat app that works with iMessage and others","[""Decades ago, a software program called Trillian introduced a way for internet users to interact with multiple IM networks, like ICQ, AIM and MSN Messenger, in a single window. Now, Pebble founder and Y Combinator Partner Eric Migicovsky is revisiting this concept, but this time with a focus on centralizing access to modern-day chat applications. Through the newly launched app, Beeper, users can connect with 15 different messaging services, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Instagram and Twitter DMs, Messenger, Skype, Hangouts and others — even, through a few tricks, iMessage.Migicovsky says he first came up with the idea for a universal chat app while working on the smartwatch pioneer Pebble, before its acquisition by Fitbit.“We really wanted Pebble to be able to send iMessages, but we could never figure out a way to do it because there’s no API for iMessage,” he explains. But the idea for Beeper came to a head two years ago when he learned about a protocol called Matrix. “All of Beeper is built on top of Matrix, which is this open-source federated, encrypted messaging protocol,” he says.Migicovsky describes Matrix as mostly “a hacker thing,” but believes it’s starting to take off among developers. Basically, Matrix offers an API that allows developers to connect with other chat networks using a “bridge,” which relays the messages back and forth from one side to another.“When I learned about that, I was like ‘Hey, we could build Trillion using Matrix,'” Migicovsky says.Image Credits: BeeperMigicovsky began to work on Beeper as a side project with Tulir Asokan, a Matrix contributor he met in a Matrix chat room.To make Beeper (previously called Nova) work with all the different chat apps, they had to build these connecting “bridges.” This code is also open-sourced and available at Gitlab.com/Nova.“We think it’s really important for people to know what code they’re running — so it’s all open source. People can inspect it,” notes Migicovsky.Because of this, people also don’t have to pay Beeper the $10 per month it’s charging for access to the service. If they know what they’re doing, they can just run the bridges on their own servers, if they choose.While every messaging platform has its own unique setup in Beeper, making iMessage work was the most complicated. And the workaround here is somewhat involved, to put it mildly.Beeper actually ships its users an old, jailbroken iPhone (iPhone 4S, because it’s cheap) to serve as the bridge. The code installed on the iPhone reads and writes to the database file where your iMessages are stored. The iPhone encrypts the messages with your own private key and then sends it over the Beeper network. This means Beeper, the company, can’t read your messages, Migicovsky says.This process allows Android, Windows and Linux users to use iMessage. But it’s not the only way Beeper can make iMessages work. Mac users with an always-on device can instead choose to install a Beeper Mac app to work as the bridge.Migicovsky says he’s not afraid of any shutdown attempts or litigation by Apple.“What are they going to do?,” he asks, rhetorically.Even if Apple somehow stopped Beeper from providing jailbroken iPhones to users, the company could redirect their customers to acquire their own old iPhones from Craigslist instead. Meanwhile, the software itself is open source and running on an iPhone at the user’s house — so Beeper isn’t really “hacking” into iMessage itself.“I think given the current climate of messaging freedom — I think it would be insane for Apple to start picking a fight with their own users,” Migicovsky adds. Plus, he notes that the European Commission is working on draft legislation similar to the GDPR that mandates all companies to open up messaging for other platforms.“When that passes, they legally won’t be able to block people from doing something like Beeper,” Migicovsky notes.Image Credits: BeeperBeeper, of course, is not the first or only startup focused on trying to break through the iMessage lockdown. Other apps have tried to do this in the past, like AirMessage or weMessage, for example. They have only seen limited adoption, however. And Beeper is not the only startup to try to centralize chat applications, either — Texts.com is developing a similar system.That said, signups for Beeper were bigger than Migicovsky expected, he says, though declined to share the details. He says Beeper is slowly onboarding users as a result. (For that reason, we have not been able to actually use Beeper. We can’t speak to its claims or usability.)Despite the competition, where Beeper may have an advantage is in understanding what makes for a great user experience. Pebble, after all, sold over 2 million watches.Today, Beeper promises features like search, snoozing, archiving, and reminders, and works across MacOS, Windows, Linux\u200d, iOS and Android.Longer term, Migicovsky envisions a platform that could do more than just text and share media, stickers and emoji, like other chat apps. Instead, the team is building a platform that would allow people to build more tools and apps on top of Beeper — a system sort of like Gmail’s plugins. For example, there could be tools that would let users schedule calendar events from within their chats. Or perhaps a tool could help you see all the most recent messages you’ve had with a particular user across different platforms, like Clearbit.Migicovsky declined also to detail how the work on Beeper is being financed but when asked if Beeper could be the next step for him — as in, a new company to work on — he replied, “possibly.”“I’m enjoying my time at YC. It is fantastic. I was just inspired by all the companies that I work with to do this. Part of being VC is talking to all these founders who are building cool stuff and launching it. And I got a little bit jealous,” he admits.Instagram revamps its mobile messaging app Threads""]",Share on Twitter ,"['NavigationClose', 'ICQ', 'AIM', 'MSN Messenger', 'Pebble', 'Y Combinator Partner', 'Eric Migicovsky', 'WhatsApp', 'Telegram, Signal, Instagram', 'Messenger', 'Migicovsky', 'Pebble', 'Pebble', 'iMessages', 'Matrix', 'Migicovsky', 'Trillion', 'Matrix', 'Migicovsky', 'BeeperMigicovsky', 'Matrix', 'Matrix', 'Nova', 'Migicovsky', 'Beeper', 'iPhone', 'iPhone', 'iPhone', 'Migicovsky', 'Android, Windows and Linux', 'Beeper Mac', 'Migicovsky', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'iPhones', 'iPhones', 'iPhone', 'Apple', 'Migicovsky', 'the European Commission', 'Migicovsky', 'BeeperBeeper', 'iMessage', 'AirMessage', 'weMessage', 'Texts.com', 'Migicovsky', 'Android', 'Migicovsky', 'Gmail’s', 'Clearbit', 'Migicovsky', 'VC', 'ThreadsclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'othersSarah Perez11:28 PM', 'ICQ', 'AIM', 'MSN Messenger', 'Pebble', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Wj7hNCWM1S,2021-01-21T22:12:33,"Forsaking funding at a $1 billion valuation, Solugen preps a new green chemical product and a big 2021","['Late last year, Solugen, a startup using synthetic biology to take hydrocarbons out of the chemicals industry, decided against pursuing a new round of funding that would have valued the company at over $1 billion, TechCrunch has learned.Instead, the Houston-based bio-manufacturing company raised an internal round of roughly $30 million from existing investors and continued working on its latest project — a new bio-based manufacturing process for a high-value specialty chemical that can act as an anti-corrosive agent.That work represents a potentially lucrative new product line for the company and charts a course for a host of other businesses that are refashioning the basic building blocks of life in an attempt to supplant chemistry with biology for manufacturing and production.If Solugen can get its high-value chemical into commercial production, the company can follow the path that sustainable tech companies like Tesla have mastered — moving from a pricy specialty product into the mass market. And rather than over-promise and underdeliver, Solugen wanted to get the product line right first before raising big bucks, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.As the world looks to move away from oil and its byproducts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down or reverse global climate change, the chemicals industry is in the crosshairs as a huge target for disruption. Vehicle electrification solves only one part of the oil problem. The extractive industry doesn’t just produce fuel, but also the chemicals that make up most of the products that defined consumer goods in the twentieth century.Chemicals are everywhere and they’re a huge business.Companies like Zymergen raised hundreds of millions of dollars last year to develop industrial applications for synthetic biology, and they’re not alone. Startups including Geltor, Impossible Foods, Ginkgo Bioworks, Lygos, Novomer and Perfect Day have all raised significant amounts of capital to reduce the environmental footprint of food, chemicals, ingredients and plastics through synthetic biology.Synthetic biology startups are giving investors an appetiteSome of these companies are seeing early success in food replacements and ingredients, but the promise of biologically based chemicals have been elusive — until now.Solugen’s new product will produce glucaric acid, a tough-to-make chemical that can be used in water treatment facilities and as an anti-corrosive agent — and the company can make it with a zero carbon (or potentially carbon negative) manufacturing process, according to Solugen co-founder and chief technology officer, Sean Hunt.The glucaric acid from Solugen is cheaper to produce and more environmentally friendly than existing phosphonates that are used for water treatment — and the company has the benefit of competing against chemicals manufacturers in China.Given the continuing tensions between the two countries, the U.S. is looking to make more high-value products — including chemicals — domestically, and Solugen’s technology is a good way forward to have home-grown supplies of critical materials.Solugen still intends to raise more capital, the company just wanted to wait until its latest production plant for the acid came online, according to Hunt.It’s also the fruit of years of planning. The two co-founders, Hunt and Gaurab Chakrabarti, first realized they could potentially use the technology they’d developed to make specialty chemicals back in 2017, according to Hunt. But first the company had to make the hydrogen peroxide as a precursor chemical, Hunt said.“It’s advantageous for us to focus on this,” said Hunt. “As we scale, we can enter more commodity-type markets down the road.”It’s all part of the notable strides the entire industry is making, said Hunt. “Synthetic biology has really made significant strides,” he said. “We have our commercial plant coming online this summer [and it proves] synthetic biology has gotten to the point where we can compete on price and performance.”So the capital infusion will come as the company gets closer to the completion of these commercial scale facilities.“It’s not like we were sitting on a term sheet and we said no,” Hunt said. “We want to make sure that we are hitting the milestones and the goals at a commensurate pace which is this year. I’m extremely bullish and optimistic of 2021.”Solugen’s co-founder sees the path that his company is on as one that other startups working in the synthetic biology space will pursue to bring profitable products to market at the higher end before competing with more sustainable versions of commodity chemicals.“How do you start a company that has this level of capital intensity?” Hunt asked. “You can start in the fine chemicals space where everything sells for tens to hundreds of dollars per pound. For us, glucaric acid is that specialty chemical and then we will do commodity.”Zymergen raised $300 million because synthetic biology is so hot right now']",Omnipresent,"['Solugen', 'NavigationClose', 'Solugen', 'GraphicaArtis / Getty ImagesLate', 'Solugen', 'TechCrunch', 'Tesla', 'Geltor', 'Impossible Foods', 'Novomer', 'Solugen’s', 'Sean Hunt', 'Solugen', 'Solugen’s', 'Solugen', 'Hunt', 'Hunt', 'Gaurab Chakrabarti', 'Hunt', 'Hunt', 'Hunt', 'Hunt', 'Hunt', 'Hunt', '”Zymergen', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsGreenTechStartupsTCchemicalsChinafoodGeltorGinkgo Bioworksgreenhouse', 'Solugen', 'Solugen', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/eoytk4MCV4,2021-01-21T20:37:19,The FCC has a new acting chairwoman in Jessica Rosenworcel,"['The Biden administration has officially appointed Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel acting FCC chairwoman, and she very well may be the first woman to hold the official position if she is nominated for it later this year, as many expect. With her record of standing for equal access, industry accountability and net neutrality, Rosenworcel’s FCC will be very different from her predecessor’s.(Update: This article previously stated that Rosenworcel would be the first acting FCC chairwoman, but the formidable Mignon Clyburn briefly held the acting role in 2013 while Tom Wheeler was being confirmed. If nominated and confirmed, Rosenworcel would be the first chairwoman.)“I am honored to be designated as the acting chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission by President Biden.\xa0 I thank the president for the opportunity to lead an agency with such a vital mission and talented staff. It is a privilege to serve the American people and work on their behalf to expand the reach of communications opportunity in the digital age,” she said in a statement.While Rosenworcel’s agenda will be made clear over the coming weeks and months, it is likely we will see the return of net neutrality from the shallow grave dug for it by Ajit Pai, and probably a new effort to better understand where in the country actually needs help getting broadband to those who need it, and how to do so quickly and equitably. Her first items of business, however, will likely pertain to getting internet access to those most affected by the pandemic. (Disclosure: The FCC regulates TechCrunch’s parent company, Verizon, but this has no effect on our coverage.)Rosenworcel first started at the FCC in 2003 and filled other federal communications regulation roles over the years. She was nominated for commissioner by President Obama in 2011 (confirmed in 2012), and was in the running for chair in 2013, though Tom Wheeler ended up taking the spot. Her second term as commissioner began in 2017.Throughout her tenure at the FCC Rosenworcel has pushed for net neutrality and improved broadband access for schools and economically disadvantaged areas. During Ajit Pai’s tumultuous term as chairman she offered implacable resistance to what she saw as an overly hands-off approach to regulating telecoms, and a fierce indictment of the FCC’s failure to act in the best interest of the people it serves. Here are a few examples.The FCC officially votes to kill net neutralityAt the 2017 vote killing net neutrality, Rosenworcel was unsparing in voicing her fury at the shadiness of the entire rule-making process:I dissent from this rash decision to roll back net neutrality rules. I dissent from the corrupt process that has brought us to this point. And I dissent from the contempt this agency has shown our citizens in pursuing this path today. This decision puts the Federal Communications Commission on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law and the wrong side of the American public.In 2018, with an epidemic of robocalling growing by the month, she contradicted Pai’s claim that a $120 million fine (almost certainly never collected) for one offender proved there was a “cop on the beat”:Today the FCC adopts a forfeiture order to impose a penalty on one operation that made tens of millions of robocalls two years ago.\xa0 I support it. But let’s be honest: Going after a single bad actor is emptying the ocean with a teaspoon — and right now we’re all wet.That the industry still has not widely adopted the framework that would nip robocalls in the bud is testament to this, though they should soon after the FCC finally got in gear. (This year she also contributed a piece to TechCrunch to call for immediate action on the rollout of 5G.)It’s time to chart a course for 5G successIn 2019, Rosenworcel called out the agency’s seeming lack of concern about a major loophole in telecoms regulation that allowed every mobile service vendor to essentially sell real-time location data to anyone willing to pay for it:The FCC has been totally silent about press reports that for a few hundred dollars shady middlemen can sell your location within a few hundred meters based on your wireless phone data. That’s unacceptable.Her office released letters to the agency from the major carriers as a stopgap measure to inform people. When the FCC finally formally moved against the practice, she noted, “It’s a shame that it took so long for the FCC to reach a conclusion that was so obvious.”In 2020, Rosenworcel raised for the nth time the FCC’s lack of good data concerning broadband deployment in the country. The problem had rankled for years but was highlighted by a spectacular failure to vet industry data provided more or less on the honor system, which ended up throwing off numbers nationally:This should have set off alarm bells at the FCC. In fact, agency staff reached out to the company nearly a dozen times over multiple years, including after this suspect data was filed. Despite these efforts behind the scenes, on February 19, 2019, the FCC used the erroneous data filed by BarrierFree in a press release, claiming great progress in closing the nation’s digital divide. When an outside party pointed out this was based on fraudulent information, the FCC was forced to revise its claim.An embarrassing demonstration of how poor the current system is. Of the broadband report itself she had written earlier:This report deserves a failing grade. Putting aside the embarrassing fumble of the FCC blindly accepting incorrect data for the original version of this report, there are serious problems with its basic methodology. Time and again this agency has acknowledged the grave limitations of the data we collect to assess broadband deployment.After all, if the FCC doesn’t know who actually is getting decent broadband and who isn’t, how can they direct funds to help bridge that gap?Lastly, late in 2020 when Pai caved to administration pressure to reevaluate the hugely important Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for the content posted on them, Rosenworcel once again summed up the situation simply and honestly:The timing of this effort is absurd. The FCC has no business being the president’s speech police.This abortive attempt to weaken Section 230 never had legs to begin with and will not be pursued further, according to an FCC source.These are only a handful of the more high-profile moments of Rosenworcel’s latest term, and in fact it is something of a disservice to list just them. The work of an FCC commissioner, their staff and the bureaus they rely on, is largely obscure and technical, with moments like those listed above more the exception than the rule.With the last-minute confirmation of Republican Commissioner Nathan Simington, the FCC is currently at a 2-2 in its normally 3-2 partisan makeup in favor of the presiding administration. Since Democrats won both Senate seats in Georgia, the feared deadlock will likely be avoided, with a fifth commissioner nominated and confirmed in short order so that work can begin. We’ll know more about Rosenworcel’s priorities and agenda soon.Commission Impossible: How and why the FCC created net neutrality']",Vice reports,"['FCC', 'NavigationClose', 'FCC', 'Jessica RosenworcelDevin', 'Getty ImagesThe Biden', 'Jessica Rosenworcel', 'FCC', 'Rosenworcel’s FCC', 'Rosenworcel', 'FCC', 'Mignon Clyburn', 'Tom Wheeler', 'Rosenworcel', 'the Federal Communications Commission', 'Biden', 'Rosenworcel’s', 'Ajit Pai', 'FCC', 'TechCrunch', 'Verizon', 'FCC', 'Obama', 'Tom Wheeler', 'the FCC Rosenworcel', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'Rosenworcel', 'the Federal Communications Commission', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'Rosenworcel', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'Rosenworcel', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'FCC', 'Rosenworcel’s', 'FCC', 'Nathan Simington', 'FCC', 'Senate', 'Rosenworcel’s', 'FCC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'FCC', 'Jessica RosenworcelDevin Coldewey9:37', 'Biden', 'Jessica Rosenworcel', 'FCC', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/8MfMdi3sA3,2021-01-21T20:34:25,How Bitcoin is helping middle-class users survive the pandemic,"['Leigh CuenContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tLeigh Cuen is a reporter in New York City. Her work has been published by Vice, Business Insider, Newsweek, Teen Vogue, Al Jazeera English, The Jerusalem Post, and many others. Follow her on Instagram at @leighcuen.\tMore posts by this contributorMeet the entrepreneurs bringing bitcoin to institutionsHow Bitcoin is helping middle-class users survive the pandemicRegulators may still want to imply Bitcoin is merely a tool for criminals, but for many middle-class users, it’s proving to be a lifeline.Even as politicians like European\xa0Central Bank President Christine Lagarde criticize cryptocurrency for providing “loopholes” used for “funny business,” people like Saeed, an Iranian immigrant to France, see cryptocurrency as a necessity, because of the difficulty using mainstream financial systems.Until 2020, Saeed, who asked to be identified only by his first name, was a software engineer in Iran whose salary barely reached €300 due to rampant inflation. In 2017, he started freelancing for international clients that paid him in Bitcoin. By September 2020, he’d finally saved enough Bitcoin to go to graduate school in France. However, the pandemic made his immigration process much harder.“I passed all that strange bureaucracy and to get to a course in France last September, with only €1,000 in my pocket,” Saeed said. “HSBC, Banque Nationale de Paris, La Banque Postale, all rejected me, declining to open a bank account. I finally found a bank after a month.”In the meantime, Saeed used Bitcoin. He is exactly the type of person who benefits from “loopholes” in the traditional banking system.“Many people in Iran are working with European tech companies,” Saeed said. “Maybe I can’t buy Bitcoin directly from the exchange because of my nationality.”Saeed thinks Lagarde represents bankers’ and government interests, not average citizens, who are happy to work with him. He said stricter regulations would make his access to the financial system more time-consuming and expensive, because he’d have to pay friends and colleagues to transact on his behalf. However, Iranian migrants are hardly the sole user group relying on Bitcoin during the pandemic.The cryptocurrency momentIn the United Kingdom, a British expat named Paul found himself trapped in London when flights back to his Asian country of residence got canceled. Due to tight capital controls in his former country, and the challenges of repatriation during constant lockdowns, Paul was living in between regulatory systems.“I closed down the business [in Asia] just before the pandemic started. My father passed away and it was difficult to continue my company,” Paul said. “I was in hotels and Airbnbs for weeks and didn’t have a residential address…without Bitcoin I would have been locked out of cash. I could only take money out of the ATM for a certain number of months because it’s limited to holidays.”Luckily, Paul had a little Bitcoin from earlier that year. Unlike Saeed, he didn’t feel comfortable with the technical aspects, but he learned quickly. He used Bitcoin to buy gift cards for groceries, phone bills, hotels and Uber, plus paid a friend back in Asia to help wrap up his apartment and put things in storage.“I think it was generally a bad idea but, at least with Brexit, thank god we won’t be subject to whatever Lagarde does,” Paul said, adding that regulation can be beneficial if it avoids restrictions for people who don’t have banking access.Today, almost a year later, Paul still doesn’t have access to most of his financial accounts. Instead, he downloaded Monzo, a banking app that uses passports for identity verification instead of residential addresses. He pays friends in London to deposit to his Monzo account.“It becomes really convoluted. I primarily use crypto because it’s easier,” Paul said. “One of my friends is a student from Nigeria and had a similar experience. He used Bitcoin to pay his school fees… I’ve been at my current residence for a couple of months, so I would be able to finally open a bank account. But now I don’t really see the need, especially with the news of negative interest rates.”Meanwhile, the fiat-denominated price of Bitcoin surged over the past six months. This provided Saeed and Paul both with a little extra capital to spend time figuring out what they want to do next. For Saeed, does it make sense to do the graduate program online, with fewer networking benefits and hands-on experiences (the reason he came to France)? How does Paul move forward with his career now that his family business closed and his sector (music marketing) is in shambles?\xa0Bitcoin passes $20K and reaches all-time highBuying Bitcoin could be considered a form of gambling. Indeed, many middle-class hobbyist traders accrued life-changing amounts of wealth over the past year, usually by experimenting with risky software. For people like Paul and Saeed, who generally avoid experimental trades and lack alternative investment options, Bitcoin’s price appreciation is helping them get through a period of abysmal job markets and intermittent lockdowns. People don’t need to live in a dictatorship or a country suffering from high inflation to benefit from Bitcoin. I would know; I’m one of them.\xa0Like many people during the pandemic, my living situation changed dramatically and I initially couldn’t work full-time from home. I was lucky to sell a few poems in exchange for cryptocurrency, usually via direct messages and Bitcoin wallets or as digital collectibles through collaborations with tech-savvy artists. Then the bull market surged again, sending those meager earnings high enough to cover some of my bills. A valet worker and student in Kansas named Hess had a similar experience.\xa0Quarantine helped kill his relationship of six years and he found himself needing to move out. He put his savings into Bitcoin during spring 2020, so that by December he was able to move out.“COVID hit and I was out of steady work for four months,” Hess said. “Honestly, if it wasn’t for my decision to basically throw 70% of my net worth into Bitcoin, I don’t think I would be in as good of a place mentally and financially.”To be clear, that is an extremely risky financial move and I would not advise it as a first resort. Yet, for many people experiencing unexpected change due to COVID-19, Bitcoin has become the lifeline it was for Hess.Over the past year, Bitcoin donations may have gained popularity with several American communities, including some of the extremist groups involved with storming Capitol Hill. Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed Lagarde’s concerns about Bitcoin being used for criminal activities.However, so far, the analytics company Chainalysis estimates such donations add up to roughly $522,000. These numbers might also be compared to the cumulative totals managed by other subjects referenced in this article. For yet another lawful example, Lawrence Douglas, a former operations director at an event security company in California, lost his job as a result of the pandemic.The Biden administration can change the world with new crypto regulations“Cash App pretty much changed my financial life,” Douglas said. “Bitcoin prices during the calendar year of 2020 provided me with lots of wiggle room, while I currently search for a new job.”As an unemployed Black man, he was statistically less likely to have connections who could help him learn about stocks or precious metals, for example. He said Bitcoin, comparatively, has a “low barrier to entry.” In April 2020, he turned his stimulus check into a little Bitcoin nest egg. By November, he was utilizing a strategy called dollar-cost averaging, routinely buying small amounts of Bitcoin.Douglas, like Paul, first bought cryptocurrency during the pandemic. On the other hand, when I interviewed more than a dozen Bitcoin users across Europe and North America for this article, most of them were crypto veterans who said Bitcoin gave them “peace” during the year-long crisis. Anesthesiologist Quentin Lobb, for example, said “bottom line, our net worth grew tremendously in 2020, thanks to Bitcoin. It has provided a pleasant and exciting sense of financial security.”Yet another crypto veteran, Texas real estate agent broker Brandon Arnold, said the national political and economic situation was more “mentally taxing than ever before.” Against that backdrop, controlling a fraction of his own wealth gives him a sense of security. The price appreciation helps too, to be sure, though it’s not why Bitcoin is now so popular with middle-class users.“If I factor in the risk of not having access to my capital, the price volatility doesn’t really matter,” Paul said. “As long as the price of Bitcoin doesn’t go to zero, it’s still more useful for me than the other options available.”\xa0']",,"['NavigationClose', 'Dan Kitwood', 'Leigh Cuen', 'Business Insider', 'Newsweek', 'Teen Vogue', 'Al Jazeera English', 'The Jerusalem Post', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'European\xa0Central Bank', 'Christine Lagarde', 'Saeed', 'Saeed', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'HSBC', 'Banque Nationale de Paris', 'La Banque Postale', 'Saeed', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'ATM', 'Bitcoin', 'Saeed', 'Uber', 'Brexit', 'Monzo', 'Monzo', 'Bitcoin', 'Saeed', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin’s', 'Bitcoin', 'Hess', 'Bitcoin', 'Hess', 'Bitcoin', 'COVID-19', 'Bitcoin', 'Hess', 'Bitcoin', 'Capitol Hill', 'Treasury', 'Janet Yellen', 'Lagarde’s', 'Lawrence Douglas', 'Biden', 'Douglas', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'Douglas', 'Bitcoin', 'Quentin Lobb', 'Brandon Arnold', 'Bitcoin', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Bitcoin', 'Bitcoin', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The fundraise was led by an undisclosed investor with participation from existing investors, Episode 1, Playfair Capital and Truesight Ventures. The company said it closed the round five months after its July 2020 $2 million seed round.Founders Matthew Wilson and Guenther Eisinger started the company as part of Entrepreneur First’s London cohort in 2019.Omnipresent says it ensures the process of remote-hiring costs a fraction of what it would if the company did it on their own, by using Omnipresent’s platform to onboard employees compliantly in 150 countries. It provides employees with local contracts, tax contributions, and local and international benefits such as health insurance, pensions and equity options.In a joint statement, Guenther Eisinger and Matthew Wilson, co-CEOs of Omnipresent said: “Even before the pandemic we recognized the revolutionary potential of breaking down legal and administrative barriers of international employment. As former business owners, we had firsthand experience of what a headache it is to navigate the complexity and bureaucracy of building global teams. Now with the pandemic and the global shift toward remote working it’s confirmed that we are on the right track.”Wilson told me in an interview: “For instance, in Canada, we have a Canadian entity and we enter into an employment relationship with that person in Canada, on behalf of our client, so they don’t have to set up any of the legal infrastructure themselves in Canada, or any of the 149 countries that we operate in. We then manage all the ongoing administration of the employment relationship, whether that’s from an HR perspective, from an employee benefits perspective, or if they want to get health care for instance.”The company competes with other firms like Remote.com and Boundless HQ.Carina Namih, general partner at Episode 1 Ventures commented: “While talent is evenly distributed around the world, for too long, opportunities have not been. I have experienced firsthand the challenge of hiring globally. Omnipresent has already become a crucial piece of infrastructure for global teams working across different countries.”Joe Thornton, general partner at Playfair Capital commented: “Remote work undoubtedly represents the future of the modern workforce. The sooner companies adapt, the sooner they will reap the massive competitive advantage associated with a globally distributed workforce, including increased workforce productivity and satisfaction and a larger and more diverse pool of talent from which to recruit workers.”Omnipresent said its own employer surveys show that over 85% of employers will be employing remote or international employees in 2021.Austin-based ReturnSafe raises $3.25 million for its employee health management tools']",Array,"['NavigationClose', 'Omnipresent / APOmnipresent', 'Playfair Capital and Truesight Ventures', 'Matthew Wilson', 'Guenther Eisinger', 'Entrepreneur First’s', 'Omnipresent’s', 'Guenther Eisinger', 'Matthew Wilson', 'Omnipresent', 'Remote.com', 'Boundless HQ.Carina', 'Episode 1 Ventures', 'Thornton', 'Playfair Capital', 'ReturnSafe', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/3ZFmujVld9,2021-01-21T19:40:08,"Instacart is eliminating nearly 2,000 jobs","['Instacart plans to lay off nearly 2,000 of its workers, including the 10 workers from the Kroger-owned Mariano’s who unionized early last year, Vice reports. These workers are responsible for in-store shopping and packing of groceries.According to Vice, 10 of the workers affected unionized with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1546 in Skokie, Illinois. However, they have yet to negotiate a contract with Instacart, according to Vice. Instacart notified the union of the planned changes earlier this week. In the letter, Instacart said it planned to stop using in-store shoppers at Kroger-owned stores, which includes the Mariano’s store in Skokie, in Q1 and Q2 of this year, but no earlier than mid-March.Currently, Instacart says it’s working to place the impacted employees with jobs at retailers or place them at other grocery stores that still rely on Instacart shoppers. In total, Instacart said about 1,800 employees will be affected by these changes. Those laid off will receive separation packages, according to Instacart. But according to UFCW, Instacart will provide between $250 to $750 to the workers they let go.Instacart referenced the potential layoffs in a blog post earlier this week in a post about new pickup retailer model. In it, Instacart said it would wind down some of its in-store operations at some retail locations to switch to what it’s calling Partner Pick. Through Partner Pick, instead of relying on Instacart shoppers to pick and pack groceries, retailers will rely on their own workforces with the help of Instacart’s technology.“As a result of some grocers transitioning to a Partner Pick model, we’ll be winding down our in-store operations at select retailer locations over the coming months,” an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We know this is an incredibly challenging time for many as we move through the COVID-19 crisis, and we’re doing everything we can to support in-store shoppers through this transition. This includes transferring impacted shoppers to other retailer locations where we have Instacart in-store shopper roles open, working closely with our retail partners to hire impacted shoppers for roles they’re looking to fill and providing shoppers with transition assistance as they explore new work opportunities. We’re also providing all impacted shoppers with separation packages based on their tenure with Instacart.”This all comes as Instacart is gearing up to go public. In November, Reuters reported Instacart picked Goldman Sachs to lead its IPO at a $30 billion valuation. That would be a big jump from the $17.7 post-money valuation Instacart secured in October with a new $200 million funding round.In a statement, UFCW International president Marc Perrone called these workers a lifeline during the COVID-19 pandemic and called on Instacart to stop these plans to fire them.“Instacart firing the only unionized workers at the company and destroying the jobs of nearly 2,000 dedicated frontline workers in the middle of this public health crisis, is simply wrong,” he said. “As the union for Instacart grocery workers in the Chicago area and grocery workers nationwide, UFCW is calling on Instacart to immediately halt these plans and to put the health of their customers first by protecting the jobs of these brave essential workers at a time when our communities need them most.”Instacart raises $200M more at a $17.7B valuation']",Clegg said in a blog post,"['Instacart', 'NavigationClose', 'Rose Dickey@meganrosedickey / 8:40 PM', 'Denver Post Photo', 'Cyrus McCrimmon / Getty ImagesInstacart', 'Kroger', 'Mariano’s', 'the United Food and Commercial Workers Local', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Kroger-owned', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'UFCW', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Partner Pick', 'Partner Pick', 'Instacart', 'Instacart’s', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'Reuters', 'Instacart', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Instacart', 'UFCW International', 'Marc Perrone', 'Instacart', 'Instacart', 'UFCW', 'Instacart', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsLaborTCInstacartlaborInstacart', 'Rose Dickey8:40', 'Kroger', 'Mariano’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/j2M3Z9NNMn,2021-01-21T13:16:34,"Creative Fabrica, a platform for digital crafting resources, lands $7 million Series A","['Roemie Hillenaar and Anca Stefan, the co-founders of Creative Fabrica. Image Credits: Creative FabricaCreative Fabrica is best known as a marketplace for digital files, like fonts, graphics and machine embroidery designs, created for crafters. Now the Amsterdam-based startup is planning to expand into new verticals, including yarn crafts and projects for kids, with a $7 million Series A round led by Felix Capital. FJ Labs and returning investor Peak Capital also participated.The new funding brings Creative Fabrica’s total raised to about $7.6 million, including its 2019 seed round.Before launching Creative Fabrica in 2016, co-founders Anca Stefan and Roemie Hillenaar ran a digital agency. The startup was created to make finding digital files for creative projects easier. It started as a marketplace, but now also includes a showcase for finished projects, tools for creating fonts and word art, and a subscription service called the Craft Club. The company currently claims more than one million users around the world, with about 60% located in the United States and 20% in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.Creative Fabrica’s sellers make money in a couple of ways. If their digital assets are purchased individually, they get 50% of revenue. Files downloaded through the subscription service are assigned points, with creators receiving revenue at the end of the subscription period based on the number of points they accumulate.Hillenaar, the company’s chief executive officer, told TechCrunch that Creative Fabrica launches new verticals based on what they see users sharing on their platform. For example, its designs are often used for die-cutting, and it recently launched POD (print on demand) files and digital embroidery verticals based on user interest.Many of the files sold on Creative Fabrica include a commercial license and about 35% of its users actively sell the crafts they make. There are several other marketplaces that offers digital downloads for crafters and designers, including Etsy and Creative Market. Hillenaar said Creative Fabrica’s automated curation gives it more control over copyright infringement than Etsy, which means its users have more assurance that they can sell things made with its files without running into issues. While Creative Market also sells fonts, vector graphics and other files, it is mostly targeted toward publishers and website designers. Creative Fabrica’s focus on crafters means it files are designed to work with home equipment like Silhouette, a die-cutting machine.Creative Fabrica also focuses on the entire creative process of a crafter or the “full funnel,” Hillenaar added. For example, someone who wants to make decorations for a birthday party can look through projects shared to the platform for inspiration, download digital materials and then start crafting using Creative Fabrica’s tutorials. Since many of Creative Fabrica’s crafts involve equipment like desktop die-cutting machines or sewing and embroidery machines, the platform offers a series of comprehensive tutorials to help crafters get started.Gift Guide: 8 DIY and crafting gifts to help your friends make more stuff and learn new skillsAs Creative Fabrica expands into verticals like yarn crafts (it already offers knitting and crochet patterns) and kids’ projects, it’ll compete more directly with a site likes Ravelry, which many yarn crafters rely on for patterns and services like Kiwi Crate that supply materials and instructions for children. Hillenaar said Creative Fabrica’s value proposition is focusing on the many people who take part in several different kinds of crafts.According to a report from the Association for Creative Industries, about 63% of American households are involved with some form of craft. Out of that number, most partake in multiple kinds of projects.“Somebody who is knitting is also likely to do die-cutting or woodworking, or another type of craft,” he said. “We believe that with our holistic view on this market we can cater to your whole creative crafting side instead of focusing on just one niche.”']",Bodyguard,"['Creative Fabrica', 'CommentRoemie Hillenaar', 'Anca Stefan', 'Creative Fabrica', 'Felix Capital', 'FJ Labs', 'Peak Capital', 'Creative Fabrica', 'Creative Fabrica', 'Anca Stefan', 'Roemie Hillenaar', 'the Craft Club', 'Files', 'Creative Fabrica', 'POD', 'Creative Fabrica’s', 'Etsy', 'Silhouette', 'Creative Fabrica', 'Gift Guide', 'DIY', 'Creative Fabrica', 'the Association for Creative Industries', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsRecent', 'FabricadesignEuropefelix', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/4b7CU6la2Y,2021-01-21T17:57:34,Facebook’s Oversight Board will review the decision to suspend Trump,"['Facebook announced Thursday that its newly established external policy review group will take on one of the company’s most consequential acts: The decision to suspend former President Trump.On January 7, Facebook suspended Trump’s account indefinitely. That decision followed the president’s actions the day prior, when he incited a violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol, leaving American democracy on a razor’s edge and a nation already deep in crisis even more shaken.Facebook VP of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg called the circumstances around Trump’s suspension an “unprecedented set of events which called for unprecedented action” and explained why the Oversight Board would review the case.“Our decision to suspend then-President Trump’s access was taken in extraordinary circumstances: A U.S. president actively fomenting a violent insurrection designed to thwart the peaceful transition of power; five people killed; legislators fleeing the seat of democracy,” Clegg said in a blog post.“This has never happened before — and we hope it will never happen again.”Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for ‘at least the next two weeks’In its own statement on taking the case, the Oversight Board explained that a five-member panel will evaluate the case soon with a decision planned within 90 days. Once that smaller group reaches its conclusions on how to handle Trump’s Facebook status — and, potentially, future cases involving world leaders — the decision will require approval from the majority of the board’s members. After that, the pace picks up a bit and Facebook will have one week to implement the board’s final decision.Facebook likes to say that the board is independent, but in spite of having the autonomy to make “binding” case-by-case decisions, the board grew out of Facebook itself. The company appointed the board’s four original co-chairs and those members went on to expand the group into a 20-member body.As we’ve previously reported, the mechanics of the board bias its activity toward Facebook content taken down — not the stuff that stays up, which generally creates larger headaches for the company and society at large. Facebook has responded to this critique, noting that while the board may initially focus on reviewing takedowns, content still up on the platforms will be part of the project’s scope “as quickly as possible.”Given some of the criticism around the group, the Trump case is a big moment for how impactful the board’s decisions will really wind up being. If it were to overturn Facebook’s decision, that decision would likely kick up a new firestorm of interest around Trump’s Facebook account, even as the former president recedes from the public eye.The most interesting bit about the process is that it will allow the former president’s account admins to appeal his own case. If they do so, the board will review a “user statement” arguing why Trump’s account should be reinstated.Facebook’s external decision-making body is meant as a kind of “supreme court” for the company’s own policy making. It doesn’t really move quickly or respond in the moment, but instead seeks to establish precedents that can lend insight to future policy cases. While the per-case decisions are binding, whether the broader precedents it creates will impact Facebook’s future policy decisions remains to be seen.Facebook’s controversial Oversight Board starts reviewing content moderation cases']",Alchemist Accelerator,"['Facebook’s Oversight Board', 'NavigationClose ScreenFacebook’s Oversight Board', 'Getty Images', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'Global Affairs', 'Nick Clegg', 'Trump’s', 'the Oversight Board', 'Trump', 'Clegg', 'Zuckerberg', 'Trump', 'the Oversight Board', 'Trump’s', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'Trump’s', 'Oversight Board', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Oversight Board', 'Trump', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

French startup Bodyguard recently launched its app and service in English so that it can hide toxic content from your eyes. It has been available in French for a few years and the company has attracted 50,000 users so far.“We have developed a technology that detects hate speech on the internet with a 90% to 95% accuracy and only 2% of false positive,” founder and CEO Charles Cohen told me.The company has started with a mobile app that anyone can use. After you download the app and connect the app with your favorite social networks, you choose the level of moderation. There are several categories, such as insults, body shaming, moral harassment, sexual harassment, racism and homophobia. You can select whether it’s a low priority or a top priority for each category.After that, you don’t have to open the app again. Bodyguard scans replies and comments from its servers and makes a decision whether something is OK. For instance, it can hide comments, mute users, block users, etc. When you open Instagram or Twitter again, it’s like those hateful comments never existed.The app currently supports Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Twitch. Unfortunately, it can’t process content on Snapchat and TikTok due to API limitations.Behind the scenes, most moderation services rely heavily on machine learning or keyword-based moderation. Bodyguard has chosen a different approach. It algorithmically cleans up a comment and tries to analyze the content of a comment contextually. It can determine whether a comment is offensive to you, to a third-party person, to a group of persons, etc.More recently, the startup has launched a B2B product. Other companies can use a Bodyguard-powered API to moderate comments in real-time on their social platforms or in their own apps.

https://t.co/XyeSFP5jiJ,2021-01-21T16:56:36,Walking Duck is a digital news startup trying to find middle ground in US politics,"['Can any news organization bridge the separate realities that the left and right seem to occupy in U.S. politics? A new startup with the odd-yet-memorable name Walking Duck is going to try.Walking Duck (an inversion of a “lame duck” president — a phrasing that has earned criticism as ableist — and a reference to the duck test) was founded by journalist Mark Halperin, as well as Paul and Audra Wilke, who are also backing it with their PR firm Upright Position Communications.While the startup is producing a variety of content and events, including virtual town halls, there are three main pieces to the Walking Duck strategy at launch — the Walking Duck website, which aggregates news from other publications, usually focused on a few key stories for the day, with additional commentary; plus Halperin’s newsletter Wide World of News and his Newsmax show Mark Halperin’s Focus Group.Halperin also serves as Walking Duck’s managing editor, and he said that he and the Wilkes have a shared vision for a publication that’s different from “the partisan media,” where “everything is cast through the lens of the red tribe or the blue tribe.”And yes, aggregation is a key part of that vision, not just allowing the startup to cover national news with a relatively small team of five (for now), but also to offer different perspectives. In fact, Halperin argued that any news organization that’s being honest will admit that it’s doing aggregation.Image Credits: Walking Duck“Even if you have a big scoop about something, people want to know: What’s the reaction to the scoop, how is that scoop being treated elsewhere?” he said. “Aggregation can be smarter and faster and less ideological than exists in a lot of places. You can aggregate for everyone and elevate smart over angry.”In my conversation with Halperin and Paul Wilke (Walking Duck’s CEO), I suggested that the “both sides” approach (which other new publications are also touting) has its limitations: When you’ve got a (now former) president seeking to undermine an election that he lost, and when his supporters violently storm the Capitol, simply presenting two sides of an argument as if they were equally valid seems insufficient.“We don’t always try to show both sides, accuracy matters,” Wilke said. Similarly, Halperin said that it’s less about making sure there’s a 50-50 balance, and more about avoiding the limitations of a partisan lens. As an example, he argued that liberal outlets demonized former FBI director James Comey after his memo may have cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 election, then reversed course and valorized him after President Trump fired him.“I think he should be covered on the individual incidents in a way that’s consistent,” Halperin said.All of that might sound incongruous from a journalist with a show on Newsmax — which, far from being a center-of-the-road network, has attracted an audience by being more pro-Trump and more willing to spread\xa0election misinformation than Fox News. But Halperin and Wilke said that by creating a show that brings four Trump voters and four Biden voters (not professional pundits) from across the country together over Zoom and attempting to find common ground, they’re exposing conservative viewers to new points of view — and they’d be happy to do the same for liberals if the show was on MSNBC.“Just go to any cable news network and try to find a show that’s talking to Trump voters and talking to Biden voters,” Halperin said. “We’re doing it every week. That’s the essence of trying to grapple with how do these two groups talk to each other.”Halperin does have\xa0an existing relationship with Newsmax, which came after he lost his contracts at more mainstream networks following numerous accusations of sexual harassment.When I brought up the accusations in my initial email correspondence with Wilke, he said, “[Mark’s] history is firmly in his past. He’s expressed remorse, been through counseling and has publicly (and privately) apologized to his victims, and they have … accepted his apologies. Additionally, Upright (my other company) is a PR firm that has more women than men, and we’re bringing some of them over to Walking Duck, and we discussed this issue with them and made sure they felt comfortable and knew that a safe workplace was a priority.”I also broached the topic on our call, and Halperin said, “I recognize the expectations that people have. I’ve just continued to do my best to be a good colleague and a good professional. If people are willing to let me work, I appreciate the opportunities. But it’s up to them.”Three views on the future of media startups']",Aerobotics,"['Walking Duck', 'Adrienne Bresnahan', 'Getty ImagesCan', 'Walking Duck', 'Walking Duck', 'Mark Halperin', 'Audra Wilke', 'Upright Position Communications', 'Wide World of News', 'Newsmax', 'Mark Halperin’s', 'Focus Group', 'Walking Duck’s', 'Wilkes', 'Paul Wilke', 'Capitol', 'FBI', 'James Comey', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Trump', 'Newsmax', 'pro-Trump', 'Fox News', 'Wilke', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'Newsmax', 'Wilke', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'DuckWalking Duck', 'Walking Duck', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/mkikysouBq,2021-01-21T16:30:34,8 VCs agree: Behavioral support and remote visits make digital health a strong bet for 2021,"['In TechCrunch investor surveys of years past, we’ve seen a big focus on fixing what’s broken or bringing the infrastructure into the modern era. But the world has dramatically changed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.More of us saw our doctor on video than ever before in 2020 — reaching a 300-fold increase in telehealth visits. It was the year healthcare finally moved fully into the digital space with data management solutions as well. And, though those digital visits have fallen slightly from the beginning of the pandemic, it doesn’t look like people want to go back to the way things were in the foreseeable future.Now we’re onto the next phase where more people will be getting vaccinated, more of us will likely start to return to the office towards the end of the year, and there’s now a slew of new tech solutions to the issues 2020 presented. If you are investment-minded, as so many of our TechCrunch readers are, you will likely see a lot of potential in this space in 2021.So we asked some of our favorite health tech VCs from The TechCrunch List where we are headed in the next year, what they’re most excited about and where they might be investing their dollars next. We asked each of them the same six questions, and each provided similar thoughts, but different approaches. Their responses have been edited for space and clarity:Bryan Roberts and Bob Kocher, partners, VenrockNan Li, managing director, Obvious VenturesElizabeth Yin, general partner, Hustle FundChristina Farr, principal investor and health tech lead, OMERS VenturesUrsheet Parikh, partner, Mayfield VenturesMeha Patel, vice president and health tech expert,\xa0645 VenturesEmily Melton, founder and managing partner, Threshold VenturesBryan Roberts and Bob Kocher, partners, VenrockDo you see more consumer demand for digital services? How does this trend affect what you are looking to invest in for 2021?\nThe pandemic certainly intensified pressure on the legacy, fee-for-service, activity-based healthcare system since volumes dried up for several months. People were scared to go to the doctor and doctors who are only paid when they see patients saw their revenue evaporate overnight. Telemedicine offered some revenue salvation fee-for-service healthcare but it was impossible to do as many tests and procedures so they have by and large, since summer 2020, reverted back to in-person as much as possible for increased revenue capture.On the other hand, value-based providers were, in the short term, more insulated as they are paid based on typical levels of utilization. Not surprisingly, COVID-19 has motivated more providers to embrace value-based care because it offers much more stable cash flows and does not depend on the tyranny of cramming more patients into the daily schedule.With value-based care, the incentives are strongly aligned for more, and continued, tech-enabled virtual care since it is more profitable for those clinicians when they detect diseases earlier and take action to avoid hospitalizations. The beauty of virtual and tech-enabled care is that it can be delivered more frequently and group visits can be facilitated easily, with multiple specialists or people supporting a patient, to improve coordination and speed of action. Also, much more data can be brought to bear to make these interactions higher quality. Imagine how much better blood pressure is controlled when a doctor has not just the in-office reading but also all of the daily readings, or diabetic control when it is informed by all the data from a patient’s continuous glucose monitor, or post-surgical care when a surgeon can review daily pictures of the surgical site.The enormity of the opportunity to make healthcare more productive and recession-proof growth from our aging population will attract more entrepreneurs and more capital to healthcare IT.Digital health funding broke records in 2020, with investors\xa0pouring in over $10 billion in\xa0the first three quarters and a jump in deals overall, compared to the previous year. Do you see that trend continuing as we move back to offices and out of this pandemic or do you think this was a blip due to special circumstances?We think growth in healthcare IT has been and will continue to be, driven by (1) better businesses and business models via aligned economic incentives and information and (2) some big wins in the space via Teladoc-Livongo merger and JD Health IPO — so both sides of the supply (great businesses) — demand (investor interest) equation. For payers, many healthcare providers and patients, it is in their interest to adopt more cost-effective approaches for care delivery and to access new data to derive insights and remove arbitrages. These prerequisites are strongly aligned in favor of more healthcare IT company formation, rapid growth and successful exits.While people may spend more time receiving in-person HC in the future than today, we think the rapid adoption of virtual care in 2020 coupled with ever-stronger incentives for the healthcare system to emulate consumer technology usability and the never-ending imperative of improving affordability, will continue to drive demand for startups. We also think that downward cost pressures will drive demand for technology to replace fax-machine-era, labor-first administrative processes too.What do you think are the biggest trends to look out for in the digital healthcare industry this next year, given we are likely toward the end of the year to see more workers return to the office and everyone resuming activities as they did before this pandemic hit?We think that telehealth will become the “Intel Inside” for many of the full stack healthcare IT businesses — Medicare Advantage payers, navigation companies, virtual pharmacies, virtual primary care practices — and that patients will continue to embrace telehealth. As a result, payers will increasingly redesign how insurance benefits work to encourage every patient to start with a telehealth visit every time. In many cases, telehealth will be able to fully resolve the problem and if not, guide the patient, along with the relevant data, to the best next step in care. This will improve responsiveness and reduce costs. We do think that brick-and-mortar players will lag behind since they continue to have strong incentives for in-person care and procedures to cover their large fixed costs.COVID-19 has also made inescapable the inadequacy of behavioral healthcare in America. We have observed this firsthand through our investment in Lyra Health, which experienced dramatic growth in 2020. We think greater access to behavioral health, better coordination of behavioral health and primary care, better use of medications and tech-enabled care for more complex behavioral health conditions are all large opportunities.We also foresee virtual care growing in more specialty care areas as patients demand more convenient ways to access specialist expertise and value-based primary care doctors desire more rapid and cost-effective ways to co-manage patients.How will the Biden administration possibly affect your funding strategy in the digital health field now that there’s a change of the guard?Economic incentives to lower healthcare cost growth and the desire to use information and data to find arbitrages and insights are as aligned as ever. Remember, the law driving the adoption of new payment models is MACRA, which passed the Senate in a bipartisan 92-8 vote in 2015. This implies an uninterrupted effort to drive the adoption of value-based care in Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. A Biden administration will also continue efforts to create more interoperable data systems and support telehealth adoption.A Biden administration also reduces uncertainty around the permanence of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). They instead will focus their efforts on expanding coverage through enhanced subsidies to buy insurance, more marketing of ACA plans, greater support for e-broker enrollment and strong incentives for states to expand Medicaid. And we do not think Medicare for All will be seriously considered by a ~50/50 Senate, although it will likely be spoken about periodically and loudly by the far left.What’s the biggest category in your mind for digital health this next year? Why is that?“Technology-enabled, virtual-everything” as the initial journey in healthcare, until you need to visit a facility because in-person is necessary. In 2020, we witnessed about a decade of user adoption compressed into six months as COVID-19 made it scary, or even impossible, to access in-person healthcare. Nearly every clinician in America, and at about half of the population, conducted a virtual healthcare visit in 2020. What happened? Patients liked it. Clinicians found virtual visits useful. And going forward we think that most care will incorporate aspects of virtual care, asynchronous communication and in-person encounters only when a procedure is needed. As importantly, payers found these approaches to be more cost-effective since care was delivered more rapidly and with only the most necessary diagnostics tests ordered.Finally, are there any rising startups in your portfolio we should keep our eyes on at TechCrunch?\xa0We have two portfolio companies that may be very compelling candidates:\xa0 Suki and NewCo Health.Suki\xa0has created a virtual medical assistant that acts as a voice user interface for electronic health records, enabling a doctor to write their clinical notes, enter orders, view information and exchange data with other providers dramatically and more efficiently. They have launched primary care and specialist doctors across dozens of health systems in 2020.NewCo Health is a startup trying to democratize access to world-class cancer outcomes. Starting initially in Asia, they are tech-enabling the diagnosis, treatment planning and care management processes for cancer patients, connecting expert clinicians to every cancer case.']",Galaxy Z line.,"['Luis Alvarez', 'Getty ImagesIn TechCrunch', 'TechCrunch', 'Bryan Roberts', 'Bob Kocher', 'VenrockNan Li', 'Obvious VenturesElizabeth Yin', 'Hustle FundChristina Farr', 'VenturesUrsheet Parikh', 'Mayfield VenturesMeha Patel', 'Threshold VenturesBryan Roberts', 'Bob Kocher', 'COVID-19', 'Teladoc-Livongo', 'JD Health', 'Medicare Advantage', 'COVID-19', 'Biden', 'MACRA', 'Senate', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Advantage', 'Medicaid', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'ACA', 'ACA', 'Medicaid', 'Senate', 'Suki', 'NewCo Health', 'Suki', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Sarah Buhr5:30 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/XWaNdahS4u,2021-01-21T09:00:54,Porsche and Axel Springer increase investment into early-stage fund APX to €55M,"['Berlin-based early-stage fund APX today announced that its two investors, European publisher Axel Springer and sports car maker Porsche, have increased their investment in the fund to a total of €55 million.With this, APX, which launched in 2018, is now able to deploy up to €500,000 in pre-Series A seed funding per company. That’s up from up to €100,000 when the fund launched. So far, the group has invested in more than 70 companies and plans to increase this number to close to 200 by 2022.When APX launched, the fund didn’t disclose the total investment from Porsche and Axel Springer. Today, the team said that the new investment “more than doubles APX’s total amount for investing in new and current companies.” APX also stressed that the total volume of the fund is now “at least” €55 million, in part because the investors can always allocate additional funding for outliers.In addition to the new funding, APX also today announced that it is doing away with its 100-day accelerator program and instead opting for a long-term commitment to its companies, including participation in future rounds.“We will try and invest into 50 or more companies this year — and we were at 35 last year. So this is quite some growth,” APX founding managing director (and folk music aficionado) Henric Hungerhoff told me. “We think that our deal flow systems and our entire operations are settled in well enough that we can have quality founders in our portfolio. That’s our goal — and that might even increase to 70 the year after. […] We see really nice synergies or network effects within our portfolio, with founders helping other founders and learning from each other.”Image Credits: APXHungerhoff tells me that the team is quite confident in its ability now to identify quality deal flows. The team is using a data-driven approach. And while it leverages its own network and that of its founders, it has also set up a scout program at leading European universities to identify potential founders, for example.As APX founding managing director, and the former CEO of Axel Springer’s Plug and Play accelerator, Jörg Rheinboldt noted, APX never asks its founders to pitch. Instead, the team has multiple conversations with them about the product they want to build, how they came up with the idea — and how it changed over time.“And then, we do multiple things simultaneously,” Rheinboldt said. “One is, we look at team dynamics. How do the founders interact? We also stress them a little bit — in a friendly way — where someone asks very fast questions, or we focus a little bit on one person and see how the others rescue them. We want to know about the team dynamics and then we want to understand the strategy, how we can help them best?”The idea here is to be able to invest quickly. In addition, though, with the new funding, the team isn’t just able to invest into more companies but also invest more into the individual companies.Image Credits: APX“We want to invest deeper per startup at a very early stage,” Hungerhoff said. “So far, […] our typical approach was a non-dilution, pro-rata follow-on strategy with most of our portfolio companies. And this is something we want to pledge in the future. Looking at the past, 100% of the times in equity rounds, we do the pro-rata follow-on or more, but now, we have developed a strategy that we will, for the fastest-moving of fastest-growing companies, deploy significantly more cash in a very early phase, which means an amount of up to €500,000.”What the team saw was that the companies in its portfolio would raise a small pre-seed round from APX and other investors, with APX typically taking a 5% stake in the startup. Most founders would then go on and raise extended pre-seed or seed rounds soon thereafter.“We more felt like we missed out when we saw these companies raising really nice financing rounds and we did our investment,” Rheinbolt said. “We felt very good that we can do a pro-rata investment. but we looked at each other and said: we knew this, we knew that they would do this 12 weeks ago. We could have given them a check and maybe the round would have been done in eight weeks and maybe [our stake] wouldn’t be 5% but 7%.”Given this new focus on supporting startups throughout their lifecycle, it’s no surprise that APX did away with the 100-day program as well. But the team still expects to be quite hands-on. With a growing network, though, the partners also expect that founders will be able to learn from each other, too. “We now see the value that is coming from this,” Hungerhoff said. For example, a team that we’ve invested in two months ago, they’re now thinking about the angel round. They can actually get the best advice on this — or just experienced sharing — from another team, rather than talking to Jörg who did this maybe 30 years ago — no offense.”The team also spends a lot of time thinking about its community, which now includes founders from 20 countries. The COVID pandemic has obviously moved most of the interactions online. Before COVID, APX often hosted events in its offices, which helped create the kind of serendipity that often leads to new ideas and connections. Looking ahead, the team still believes that there is a lot of value in having face-to-face meetings, but at the same time, maybe not every company needs to move to Berlin and instead visit for a few days every now and then.‘The money is still there,’ says APX managing director Jörg RheinboldtBonus: Here is Hungerhoff’s latest album with St. Beaufort.

Cathay AfricInvest Innovation, FMO: Entrepreneurial Development Bank\xa0and Platform Investment Partners\xa0also participated.Founded in 2014 by James Paterson and Benji Meltzer, Aerobotics is currently focused on building tools for fruit and tree farmers. Using artificial intelligence, drones and other robotics, its technology helps track and assess the health of these crops, including identifying when trees are sick, tracking pests and diseases, and analytics for better yield management.\xa0The company has progressed its technology and provides to farmers independent and reliable yield estimations and harvest schedules by collecting and processing both tree and fruit imagery from citrus growers early in the season. In turn, farmers can prepare their stock, predict demand and ensure their customers have the best quality of produce.Kenya’s Apollo Agriculture raises $6M Series A led by AnthemisAerobotics has experienced record growth in the last few years. For one, it claims to have the largest proprietary data set of trees and citrus fruit in the world, having processed 81 million trees and more than a million citrus fruit.The seven-year-old startup is based in Cape Town, South Africa. At a time when many of the startups out of the African continent have focused their attention primarily on identifying and fixing challenges at home, Aerobotics has found a lot of traction for its services abroad, too. It has offices in the U.S., Australia and Portugal — like Africa, home to other major, global agricultural economies — and operates in 18 countries across Africa, the Americas, Europe and Australia.\xa0Image Credits: AeroboticsWithin that, the U.S. is the company’s primary market, and Aerobotics says it has two provisional patents pending in the country, one for systems and methods for estimating tree age and another for systems and methods for predicting yield.\xa0\xa0The company said it plans to use this Series B investment to continue developing more technology and product delivery, both for the U.S. and other markets.\xa0“We’re committed to providing intelligent tools to optimize automation, minimize inputs and maximize production. We look forward to further co-developing our products with the agricultural industry leaders,” said Paterson, the CEO in a statement.Once heralded as a frontier for technology centuries ago, the agriculture industry has stalled in that aspect for a long while. However, agritech companies like Aerobotics that support climate-smart agriculture and help farmers have sprung forth trying to take the industry back to its past glory. Investors have taken notice and over the past five years, investments have flowed with breathtaking pace.\xa0For Aerobotics, it raised $600,000 from 4Di Capital and Savannah Fund as part of its seed round in September 2017. The company then raised a further $4 million in Series A funding in February 2019, led by Nedbank Capital and Paper Plane Ventures.SunCulture wants to turn Africa into the world’s next bread basket, one solar water pump at a timeNaspers Foundry, the lead investor in this Series B round, was launched by Naspers in 2019 as a 1.4 billion rand (~$100 million) fund for tech startups in South Africa.\xa0Phuthi Mahanyele-Dabengwa, CEO of Naspers South Africa, said of the investment, “Food security is of paramount importance in South Africa and the Aerobotics platform provides a positive contribution towards helping to sustain it.

https://t.co/UVhB7HqQfz,2021-01-21T16:00:45,"Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review: Camera refinements are nice, but the price drop’s the thing","['The Galaxy S21 is a tank. It’s a big, heavy (8.04 ounces versus its predecessor’s 7.7), blunt instrument of a phone. It’s quintessential Samsung, really — the handset you purchase when too much isn’t quite enough. In fact, it even goes so far as adopting S-Pen functionality — perhaps the largest distinguishing factor between the company’s two flagship lines.In many ways it — and the rest of the S21 models — are logical extensions of the product line. Samsung hasn’t broken the mold here. But the company didn’t particularly need to. The line remains one of the best Android devices you can buy. It’s a product experience the company is content to refine, while saving more fundamental changes for the decidedly more experimental Galaxy Z line.Samsung’s Galaxy S21 line arrives with camera bumps, price drops and S Pen compatibilitySamsung certainly deserves credit for going all in on 5G early. The company was ahead of the curve in adopting next-gen wireless and was among the first to add it across its flagship offerings. 5G became a utilitarian feature remarkably fast — owing in no small part to Qualcomm’s major push to add the tech to its mid-tier chips. In fact, the iPhone 12 may well be the last major flagship that can get away with using the addition of the tech as a major selling point.With that out of the way, smartphone makers are returning to familiar terrain on which to wage their wars — namely imaging. S-Pen functionality for the Ultra aside, most of the top-level upgrades of this generation come on the camera side of things. No surprise there, of course. The camera has always a focus for Samsung — though the changes largely revolved around software, which is increasingly the trend for many manufacturers.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThere are, however, some hardware changes worth noting. Namely, the new S models represent one of the bigger aesthetic updates in recent memory. I’d mentioned being kind of on the fence about them in my original write up of the news, owing largely to that weird wrinkle of 2020/2021 gadget blogging: not being able to see the device in person. Now that I’ve been toting the product around the streets of New York for several days, I can say definitive that, well, I’m mostly kind of okay with them, I guess.The big sticking point is that massive contour cut camera housing. Pretty sure I used the word “brutalist” to describe it last time. Having used the product, I’d say it’s fairly apt. There’s something…industrial about the design choice. And it’s really pronounced on the Ultra, which sports four camera holes, plus a laser autofocus sensor and flash. It’s a big, pronounced camera bump built from surprisingly thick metal. I suspect it’s owed, in part, to the “folded” telephoto lens.Samsung sent along the Phantom Black model. The color was something the company devoted a surprising amount of stage time to during the announcement. It was the kind of attention we rarely see devoted to something as inconsequential as a color finish, outside of some Apple bits. Here’s a long video about it if you’re curious. I don’t know what to tell you. It’s nice. It’s matte black. I do dig the new metallic back; even with Corning on your side, a glass back really feels like an accident waiting to happen.The curved screen looks nice, per usual, accented well by the round corners. The screen itself is striking — Samsung’s displays always are. The screens on the S21, S21+ and S21 Ultra are 6.2, 6.7 and 6.8 inches, respectively. Those are all unchanged, save for the Ultra, which is, strangely, 0.1 inches smaller than its predecessor. It’s not really noticeable, but is an odd choice from a company that has long insisted that bigger is better when it comes to displays.Eye Comfort Shield is a welcome addition, adjusting the screen temperature based on time of day and your own usage. If you’ve used Night Shift or something similar, you know the deal — the screen slowly shifts toward the more yellow end of the white balance spectrum, reducing blue light so as to not throw your circadian rhythms out of whack. It’s off by default, so you’ll have to go into settings to change it.The company has also introduced a Dynamic Refresh Rate feature, which cycles between 46 and 120Hz, depending on the app you’re using. This is designed to save some battery life (a 120Hz along with 5G can be a big power hog). The effect is fairly subtle. I can’t say I really noticed over the course of my usage. I certainly appreciate the effort to find new ways to eke out extra juice.The new era of Samsung is equally notable for what it left off. The new S models mark the end of an era as the company finally abandons expandable storage (following in the footsteps of the Z line). I mean, I get it. These devices range from 128 to 512GB of storage. For a majority of users, the microSD reader was superfluous. I certainly never needed to use it. Per the company, “Over time, SD card usage has markedly decreased on smartphones because we’ve expanded the options of storage available to consumers.”Of course, expanding the built-in memory is going to cost you. Mostly, though, it’s always a bit of a bummer to say farewell to a long-time distinguishing factory. Speaking of, the company also ditched the in-box headphones and power adapter, notably deleting some ads in which it mocked Apple for recently doing the same. It’s the headphone jack all over again.The company offered up a similar sustainability explanation in a recent statement. “We discovered that more and more Galaxy users are reusing accessories they already have and making sustainable choices in their daily lives to promote better recycling habits.” As a consequence, the box is nearly half as thick as those from earlier S lines, for what that’s worth.As mentioned above, the cameras are remarkably similar to their predecessors, with a few key differences. The S20 Ultra sported an 108-megapixel wide lens (f/1.8), 12-megapixel ultrawide (f/2.2) and 48-megapixel (f/3.5) telephoto (4x zoom), while the S21 Ultra features a 108-megapixel wide (f/1.8), 12-megapixel ultrawide (f/2.2), 10MP (f/2.4) telephoto (3x zoom) and 10MP telephoto (f/4.9) (10x zoom). The dual telephoto lenses are the biggest differentiator.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe device will switch between telephotos, depending on how much you zoom in. The device performs a lot better than many competing handsets at distances requiring around 10x. Though, while the ability to zoom up to 100x is an extremely impressive thing for a phone to do on paper, the images degrade really quickly at higher levels. At a certain point, the image starts taking on the style of an impressionist painting, which isn’t particularly useful in a majority of cases.Once Samsung (or whoever) can properly crack the code on translating that noise into signal, it will really be a breakthrough. Still, Zoom Lock is a nice addition in helping to minimize hand shake while zooming. Accidental movements tend to increasing exponentially the tighter you get in on an image. The Super Steady, too, has been improved for video recording.Portrait mode has been improved. There still tends to be trouble with more complex shapes, but this is a problem I’ve run into with pretty much all solutions. Samsung gets some points here for offering a ton of post-shot portrait editing, from different bokeh levels, to adjusting the focal point to other effects. As with much of the camera software, there’s a lot to play around with.camera Photo: Brian Heatercamera Photo: Brian HeaterView 9 PhotosOther key additions include 8K snap, a nice addition that lets you pull high-res images from a single frame of 8K video. There’s also Vlogger Mode, which shoots from the front and back simultaneously. Someone will no doubt find some social use for this, but it feels a bit gimmicky — one of those features a majority of users will promptly forget about. Additional options are generally a good thing, though the camera software has gotten to the point where there are a ton of menus to navigate.I get the sense that most users want a way to quickly snap photos and shoot videos. The lower-end S21 entries are great for that. The hardware is strong enough to give you great shots with minimal effort. If you’re someone who really enjoys drilling down on features and getting the best images on-device without exporting to a third-party app, the Ultra is the choice for you. In addition to being a kind of kitchen sink approach, the high-end device is all about choice.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe addition of S Pen functionality is probably the most notable — and curious — thing the Ultra has going for it. On the face of it, this feels like the latest — and most pronounced — in a series of moves effectively blurring the lines between the company’s two flagships. Perhaps Samsung will make a move to further differentiate the next Note, or maybe the company is content to simply let the device meld over time.There is one major difference off the bat, of course. Namely the fact that there’s no pen slot on the S21. This means that:The stylus is sold separately.You need to buy a case with an S Pen holder (also sold separately, naturally) if you’ve got any hope of not losing it.Image Credits: Brian HeaterI happened to have a Note S Pen lying around and found the experience to be pretty smooth. I’ve been upfront about the fact that I’m not really a stylus person myself, but Samsung’s done a good job building up the software over the years. The S Pen is a surprisingly versatile tool, courtesy of several generations of updates. But I would say if the peripheral is important to you, honestly, just buy a Note.The components are what you’d expect from a high-end Samsung. That includes the brand new Snapdragon 888 (in some markets, at least), and either 12 or 16GB of RAM and 128, 256 or 512GB of storage on the Ultra. The battery remains the same as last year, at 5,000mAh. In spite of 5G and a high refresh rate, I’ve gotten more than a day and a half of moderate use on a single charge.In the end, the S21 isn’t a huge change over the S20. It’s more of a refinement, really. But it does represent a big change for Samsung. The company has implemented a $200 price drop across the board for these products. The S21, S21+ and S21 Ultra start at $799, $999 and $1,199, respectively. None are what you would call cheap, exactly, but $200 isn’t exactly insignificant, whether it means easing the blow of getting in on the entry level or taking the pain out of going for a higher-end model.It’s a clear reflection of a few years’ worth of stagnating smartphone sales, exacerbated by some dire numbers amid COVID. It’s nice to see a company take those issues — and concern around spending $1,000+ on a smartphone — to heart beyond simply offering up a flagship “lite.”Samsung answers Apple with the $199 Galaxy Buds Pro\xa0']",quietly working,"['Heater@bheater', 'Brian HeaterThe Galaxy', 'Samsung', 'Samsung', 'Android', 'Samsung’s Galaxy', 'Qualcomm’s', 'Samsung', 'Samsung', 'Phantom Black', 'Apple', 'Samsung’s', 'Samsung', 'Apple', 'Brian HeaterThe', 'Zoom Lock', 'Brian Heatercamera', 'Brian', 'PhotosOther', '8K', 'Vlogger Mode', 'Ultra', 'Brian HeaterThe', 'Ultra', 'Samsung', 'Brian', 'Samsung’s', 'Samsung', 'Snapdragon', 'RAM', 'Samsung', 'Apple', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'ArticleSamsung Galaxy', 'Brian Heater5:00 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/dK176c9vJc,2021-01-21T16:00:16,"Plaid launches FinRise, an incubator for underrepresented fintech founders","['Plaid is launching FinRise, a nine-month incubator for early-stage fintech founders from underrepresented backgrounds. Inspired by an internal hackathon amid Black Lives Matter protests last summer, the accelerator is explicitly looking at startups led by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC).Plaid Growth Manager Nell Malone and Design Manager Bhargavi Kamakshivalli are spearheading the project.Malone tells TechCrunch that the incubator is looking to accept three to five post-seed and pre-Series B tech startups with a product in the beta stage. In order to apply, startups need to have a minimum of two employees and a founder to join the program. The startup should obviously operate in the fintech space, but specifically have a part of its business focused on consumer business finance data.That last prerequisite dovetails exactly into what Plaid does: It’s a software startup that acts as connective tissue between consumer bank accounts and fintech apps. Thus, FinRise feels like a creative extension of these integrations, albeit one focused more on helping founders start companies than simply gaining new customers.Accepted startups will get mentorship from Plaid leaders, a dedicated account manager who will help with product insights, and a network where founders can go to for advice on the bootcamp sessions. The incubator is longer than an accelerator program like Y Combinator or TechStars, which usually run for three months, but less intensive.“The three-day virtual bootcamp will be the most intensive part of the FinRise program,” Malone said. “After the workshop, participants will work with their dedicated account managers and have access to ongoing programming support structures … our goal is to provide ongoing support at every stage of our participant’s journey over the course of nine months.”The announcement fortuitously comes just a week after Plaid announced it would not merge with Visa after running into regulatory hurdles. The deal, which was valued at $5.3 billion when announced, was met with optimism from fintech founders and VCs. That said, it did underscore how private fintech startups will increasingly have to deal with policy issues as the sector continues to grow.Stay gold, ‘Plaid for X’ startupsThe accelerator’s bootcamp portion, which will be a three-day affair, plans to address this dynamic in the lens of how startups should deal with regulatory and legal pressures in the financial services space. Other topics of discussion will include information security, engineering practices and user-centric design.The hurdle for underrepresented founders tends to be access to funding instead of access to mentorship. For now, the incubator isn’t taking any equity nor is it giving any capital itself, but FinRise did commit to introducing its cohort to a network of VC firms and accelerators with checkbooks.Of course, Plaid could also consider investing in any of these startups, taking a classic corporate venture capital approach. When asked if this could happen, Malone said that “this is not part of our plan right now. It’s early, we’re excited to pilot the program and see how it goes.”']",PlayVS,"['FinRise', 'NavigationClose ScreenPlaid', 'FinRise', 'Bryce Durbin', 'FinRise', 'People of Color', 'BIPOC).Plaid Growth', 'Nell Malone', 'Bhargavi Kamakshivalli', 'FinRise', 'TechStars', 'FinRise', 'Visa', 'FinRise', 'VC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'FinRise', '2021Plaid', 'FinRise', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Te8yYfysY3,2021-01-21T15:48:27,Hot IPOs hang onto gains as investors keep betting on tech,"['This morning, while checking the latest price for shares of recent IPO Poshmark, I noticed that they were down from their first-day results. The company’s pricing was more than strong, and its first trading results were nearly comical.After setting a $35 to $39 per-share IPO price range, Poshmark sold shares in its IPO at $42 apiece. Then it opened at $97.50. Such was the exuberance of the stock market regarding the used goods marketplace’s debut.But today it’s worth a more modest $76.30 — for this piece we’re using all Yahoo Finance data, and all current prices are those from yesterday’s close ahead of the start of today’s trading — which sparked a question: How many recent tech IPOs are also down from their opening price?The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.So The Exchange, ever at your service, raced around to collect the data. And what did we find? Most hot tech IPOs have held onto their gains, and many have actually run up the score in the ensuing weeks.Lemonade is a great example. It first targeted a $23 to $26 per-share IPO price. That rose to $26 to $28 per share, then it priced at $29 per share. It opened at $50.06 per share, closing the day worth $69.41.\xa0And today? A single Lemonade share will set you back $145.21. The company is now worth $8.22 billion, despite only posting Q3 revenues of $17.8 million, a decline from the year-ago period (for more on why that is, and why it isn’t as bad as you might initially think, read this.)Analysts anticipate that Lemonade will post revenues of $18.91 million in Q4 2020, again via Yahoo Finance, putting the company on an annualized run rate of 109x. For a business running with net margins of -173.6% in its most recent quarter. And that’s after Lemonade announced a large share sale!All this is to say that the fiery optimism fueling dazzling IPO debuts has the potential to keep pushing them higher. Which you can view as troubling, if you are a boring index funder like myself; enticing, if you are a founder looking to go public in the near-future; and potentially irksome if you are a VC annoyed when upside leaks to parties other than yourself.This brings us to our data set. Below, I’ve collated a host of recent IPOs, their opens and their current prices. Only one has shed value.And then we reexamined eight 2020 offerings that you will recall so we could run the same exercise.

https://t.co/SEwjTvfBWi,2021-01-21T15:47:38,YouTube launches hashtag landing pages to all users,"['YouTube is embracing the hashtag. The company has been quietly working on a new feature that allows users to better discover content using hashtags — either by clicking on a hashtag on YouTube or by typing in a hashtag link directly. Before, these actions would return a mix of content related to the hashtag, but not only those videos where the hashtag had been directly used. Now that’s changing, as YouTube has fully rolled out its new “hashtag landing pages.”Going forward, when you click on a hashtag on YouTube, you’ll be taken to a dedicated landing page that contains only videos that are using the hashtag. This page is also sorted to keep the “best” videos at the top, YouTube claimed. The ranking algorithm, however, may need some work as it’s currently surfacing an odd mix of both newer and older videos and seems to be heavily dominated by Indian creator content, in several top categories.The result, then, is not the equivalent to something like a hashtag search on a social network like Facebook or Twitter, for example, where more recent content gets top billing. For that reason, it may be difficult to use these hashtag landing pages for discovery of new videos to watch, as intended, but could still serve as an interesting research tool for creators looking to better leverage the hashtag format.For instance, you may find that the #interiordesign hashtag is a crowded place, with 8,400 channels and 29,000 videos, but a niche hashtag like #interiordesignlivingroom has under 100 channels and videos. If people began to use hashtags regularly to seek out videos, using narrowly targeted tags could potentially help creators’ videos be more easily found.Image Credits: YouTube screenshotThe hashtag landing pages are accessed through clicking on a tag on YouTube, not by doing a hashtag search. However, if you want to go to a particular hashtag page directly, you can use the URL format of youtube.com/hashtag/[yourterm] (e.g., youtube.com/hashtag/beauty).We’ve noticed, in testing the feature, that there are not hashtag pages for some controversial terms associated with content YouTube previously said it would block, like QAnon and election conspiracy videos, such as #stopthesteal.The feature itself was first announced through YouTube’s Community forum earlier this month, where it was described as a new way that YouTube would “group content together and help you discover videos through hashtags.”On Tuesday, YouTube noted on its “Creator Insider” channel that the feature had been fully rolled out to 100% of all users. (The video’s creator, however, misspoke, by saying you could “search” for hashtags to reach the new landing page. That is not the case today.)

The startup, which has raised more than $100 million, has acquired GameSeta, a Vancouver-based startup that is also looking to provide infrastructure for high school esports teams. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.The deal will accelerate PlayVS during its growth phase and help it expand into the Canadian market. GameSeta has a partnership with BC School Sports, the governing body for organized school sports in British Columbia, which will transfer to PlayVS.PlayVS has a similar (and exclusive) partnership with NFHS, the high school equivalent of the NCAA, here in the States. The company has also sprinted into the college market, launching a college product as part of a partnership between PlayVS and Epic Games. Since launching a college offering, total player growth is up 460 percent. The company has also launched a new $900,000 scholarship pool for high schools and colleges.Founded by Delane Parnell in the beginning of 2018, PlayVS has grown rapidly, brokering partnerships with school sports organizations and publishers alike. In fact, PlayVS title offerings include League of Legends, Rocket League, SMITE, Overwatch, Fortnite, FIFA 21 and Madden NFL 21. PlayVS has served more than 19,000 high schools across all 50 states. It boasts more than 230,000 registered users.PlayVS acts as a portal for schools to create esports teams and compete against other schools. Traditional sports like basketball and baseball have established systems (and governing organizations) to organize league schedules, playoffs, referees and more. PlayVS has positioned itself as that governing body and organizational system for esports.Not only does PlayVS facilitate these leagues, but it also offers colleges and esports organizations a much-needed recruitment tool, letting them view games and track metrics of individual players.As part of the acquisition, GameSeta’s Tawanda Masawi and Rana Taj will join the PlayVS team and lead Canadian operations.Alongside geographic expansion, PlayVS is also looking to expand beyond high schools and colleges with plans to launch a direct to consumer product.“We’re going to launch some direct consumer products directly in partnership with publishers to open up the PlayVS ecosystem so people can organize and join competitions, whether they are associated with high schools or otherwise,” said Parnell. “We’re really excited about that. The markets in general have just shown great appetite for gaming as a form of entertainment and content. Obviously, players are really excited about eSports as a form of content and a way to engage in competition and so we want to make sure that PlayVS is a place where people compete more broadly.”']",Soci,"['GameSeta', 'NavigationClose', 'GameSeta', 'CanadaJordan', 'GameSeta', 'GameSeta', 'BC School Sports', 'NFHS', 'NCAA', 'Delane Parnell', 'League of Legends, Rocket League', 'SMITE, Overwatch, Fortnite', 'Madden NFL', 'GameSeta', 'Rana Taj', 'Parnell', 'eSports', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'GameSeta', 'CanadaJordan Crook4:35', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/y7NGZ193bV,2021-01-21T15:06:34,MIT aims to speed up robot movements to match robot thoughts using custom chips,"['MIT researchers are looking to address the significant gap between how quickly robots can process information (relatively slowly), and how fast they can move (very quickly thanks to modern hardware advances), and they’re using something called “robomorphic computing” to do it. The method, designed by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAIL) graduate Dr. Sabrina Neuman, results in custom computer chips that can offer hardware acceleration as a means to faster response times.Custom-built chips tailored to a very specific purpose are not new — if you’re using a modern iPhone, you have one in that device right now. But they have become more popular as companies and technologists look to do more local computing on devices with more conservative power and computing constraints, rather than round-tripping data to large data centers via network connections.In this case, the method involves creating hyper-specific chips that are designed based on a robot’s physical layout and its intended use. By taking into account the requirements a robot has in terms of its perception of its surroundings, its mapping and understanding of its position within those surroundings, and its motion planning resulting from said mapping and its required actions, researchers can design processing chips that greatly increase the efficiency of that last stage by supplementing software algorithms with hardware acceleration.Xilinx launches a new reconfigurable space-grade chip optimized for local machine learning on orbitThe classic example of hardware acceleration that most people encounter on a regular basis is a graphics processing unit, or GPU. A GPU is essentially a processor designed specifically for the task of handling graphical computing operations — like display rendering and video playback. GPUs are popular because almost all modern computers run into graphics-intensive applications, but custom chips for a range of different functions have become much more popular lately thanks to the advent of more customizable and efficient small-run chip fabrication techniques.Here’s a description of how Neuman’s system works specifically in the case of optimizing a hardware chip design for robot control, per MIT News:The system creates a customized hardware design to best serve a particular robot’s computing needs. The user inputs the parameters of a robot, like its limb layout and how its various joints can move. Neuman’s system translates these physical properties into mathematical matrices. These matrices are “sparse,” meaning they contain many zero values that roughly correspond to movements that are impossible given a robot’s particular anatomy. (Similarly, your arm’s movements are limited because it can only bend at certain joints — it’s not an infinitely pliable spaghetti noodle.)The system then designs a hardware architecture specialized to run calculations only on the non-zero values in the matrices. The resulting chip design is therefore tailored to maximize efficiency for the robot’s computing needs. And that customization paid off in testing.Neuman’s team used a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), which is sort of like a midpoint between a fully custom chip and an off-the-shelf CPU, and it achieved significantly better performance than the latter. That means that were you to actually custom manufacture a chip from scratch, you could expect much more significant performance improvements.Making robots react faster to their environments isn’t just about increasing manufacturing speed and efficiency — though it will do that. It’s also about making robots even safer to work with in situations where people are working directly alongside and in collaboration with them. That remains a significant barrier to more widespread use of robotics in everyday life, meaning this research could help unlock the sci-fi future of humans and robots living in integrated harmony.']",Bloomberg report,"['MIT', 'NavigationClose', 'Ivan Bajic', 'MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence', 'Sabrina Neuman', 'iPhone', 'GPU', 'GPU', 'Neuman', 'MIT News', 'Neuman', 'Neuman', 'FPGA', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

(TripActions did raise an additional $125 million in what it called “convertible-to-IPO financing” last June, when the travel market was especially bleak.)TripActions lays off hundreds amid COVID-19 travel freezeToday, however, investors are betting on the company’s fortunes, not only providing it with another nine-figures of capital, but giving it a new, larger valuation as well.An up-round less than a year after layoffs is an impressive recovery, so TechCrunch wanted to learn more about the corporate travel market, TripActions’ bread and butter, and the pace of the venerable business trip’s recovery; as COVID-19 vaccines roll out, how quickly are employees getting back onto planes?According to a company spokesperson, the corporate travel market is at “20 percent levels as of this month,” while growing between 3% and 6% “week-over-week.” That pace of recovery could have given investors confidence that TripActions’ recovery to at least most of its former strength was merely a matter of time.TechCrunch also asked TripActions what the corporate travel market will look like in the Zoom-ready, hybrid-work world that many expect. A spokesperson wrote that the company “strongly” believes that corporate travel will come back, “maybe not at 100 percent immediately,” but to 75% “within the next year.”The spokesperson also wrote that a more distributed working population could actually boost corporate travel. If that bears out, TripActions could wind up in a stronger position post-COVID than it might have managed if the pandemic had never happened. For a unicorn forced to lay off so many workers when its market temporarily disappeared, such a return to power would be a coup.Returning to the round, TripActions intends to use the new monies to invest in its product. The company highlighted recent feature releases in an email to TechCrunch to underscore the point, including software integrations, adding that it intends to keep working on its finance-focused Liquid product.The spokesperson also said that the company “will build features on the travel side for distributed teams to meet in-person more easily.” As many anticipate that the days of completely geographically centered companies are over, the decision makes sense.TripActions secures $500M credit facility for its new corporate travel productTechCrunch asked what portion of its previously laid-off staff have been rehired to date, and if the new funds will be used to rehire employees that were let go last year. We’ll update the piece when we hear back.Regardless, from pre-pandemic highs, to a COVID-19 trough, to today with a newly raised valuation and lots of new cash, TripActions’ last year is a future business case study in the making.']",pan-EU copyright reform,"['TripActions', 'NavigationClose', 'Wilhelm@alex /', 'NurPhoto', 'Getty ImagesThis', 'TripActions', 'Andreessen Horowitz', 'Elad Gil', 'TripActions', 'TripActions', 'TripActions', 'TripActions', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'TripActions', 'Liquid', 'TripActions', 'TripActions', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsRecent', 'TripActions', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Soci said that in 2020, it brought on more than 100 new customers, representing nearly 30,000 new locations.Co-founder and CEO Afif Khoury told me that the pandemic was a crucial moment for the platform, with so many businesses “scrambling to find a real solution to connect with local audiences.”One of the key advantages to Soci’s approach, Khoury said, is to allow the national marketing team to share content and assets so that each location stays true to the “national corporate personality,” while also allowing each location to express \xa0a “local personality.” During the pandemic, businesses could share basic information about “who’s open, who’s not” while also “commiserating and expressing the humanity that’s often missing element from marketing nationally.”“The result there was businesses that had to close, when they had their grand reopenings, people wanted to support that business,” he said. “It created a sort of bond that hopefully lasts forever.”Soci raises $12M to help big brands manage local marketingKhoury also emphasized that Soci has built a comprehensive platform that businesses can use to manage all their localized marketing, because “nobody wants to have seven different logins to seven different systems, especially at the local level.”The new funding, he said, will allow Soci to make the platform even more comprehensive, both through acquisitions and integrations: “We want to connect into the CRM, the point-of-sale, the rewards program and take all that data and marry that to our search, social, reviews data to start to build a profile on a customer.”Soci has now raised a total of $110 million. The Series D was led by JMI Equity, with participation from Ankona Capital, Seismic CEO Doug Winter and Khoury himself.“All signs point to an equally difficult first few months of this year for restaurants and other businesses dependent on their communities,” said JMI’s Suken Vakil in a statement. “This means there will be a continued need for localized marketing campaigns that align with national brand values but also provide for community-specific messaging. SOCi’s multi-location functionality positions it as a market leader that currently stands far beyond its competitors as the must-have platform solution for multi-location franchises/brands.”5 VCs agree: COVID-19 reshaped adtech and martech']",Lucile Cornet,"['Soci', 'NavigationClose', 'ScreenSoci', 'Prasit', 'Getty ImagesSoci', 'Ace Hardware', 'Anytime Fitness', 'The Hertz Corporation', 'Nekter Juice Bar', 'Soci', 'Soci', 'Afif Khoury', 'Soci', 'Khoury', 'Soci', 'Soci', 'Ankona Capital', 'Doug Winter', 'Khoury', 'JMI', 'Suken Vakil', 'COVID-19', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'EquityMarketingSociSoci', 'Ace Hardware', 'Anytim', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/4lLvZwI4PL,2021-01-21T13:36:05,Apple said to be working a high-priced standalone VR headset as debut mixed reality product,"['Apple is reportedly working on developing a high-end virtual reality headset for a potential sales debut in 2022, per a new Bloomberg report. The headset would include its own built-in processors and power supply, and could feature a chip even more powerful than the M1 Apple Silicon processor that the company currently ships on its MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, according to the report’s sources.As is typical for a report this far out from a target launch date, Bloomberg offers a caveat that these plans could be changed or cancelled altogether. Apple undoubtedly kills a lot of its projects before they ever see the light of day, even in cases where they include a lot of time and capital investment. And the headset will reportedly cost even more than some of the current higher-priced VR headset offerings on the market, which can range up to nearly $1,000, with the intent of selling it initially as a low-volume niche device aimed at specialist customers — kind of like the Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR that Apple currently sells.The headset will reportedly focus mostly on VR, but will also include some augmented reality features, in a limited capacity, for overlaying visuals on real-world views fed in by external cameras. This differs from prior reports that suggested Apple was pursuing consumer AR smart glasses as its likely first headset product in the mixed reality category for consumer distribution. Bloomberg reports that while this VR headset is at a late prototype stage of development, its AR glasses are much earlier in the design process and could follow the VR headset introduction by at least a year or more.The strategy here appears to be creating a high-tech, high-performance and high-priced device that will only ever sell in small volume, but that will help it begin to develop efficiencies and lower the production costs of technologies involved, in order to pave the way for more mass-market devices later.The report suggests the product could be roughly the same size as the Oculus Quest, with a fabric exterior to help reduce weight. The external cameras could also be used for environment and hand tracking, and there is the possibility that it will debut with its own App Store designed for VR content.Virtual reality is still a nascent category even as measured by the most successful products currently available in the market, the Oculus Quest and the PlayStation VR. But Facebook at least seems to see a lot of long-term value in continuing to invest in and iterate its VR product, and Apple’s view could be similar. The company has already put a lot of focus and technical development effort into AR on the iPhone, and CEO Tim Cook has expressed a lot of optimism about AR’s future in a number of interviews.Why did Apple buy NextVR?']","After a record year for Israeli startups, 16 investors tell us what’s next","['Apple', 'NavigationClose', 'FacebookApple', 'MacBook Air', 'MacBook Pro', 'Bloomberg', 'Apple', 'Pro Display', 'Apple', 'VR', 'Apple', 'AR', 'Bloomberg', 'AR', 'VR', 'VR', 'Apple’s', 'iPhone', 'Tim Cook', 'AR’s', 'Apple', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkCopy Share', 'vrScience', 'TechnologyApple', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Flu4Kq85Af,2021-01-21T12:18:48,Google inks agreement in France on paying publishers for news reuse,"[""Google has reached an agreement with an association of French publishers over how it will be pay for reuse of snippets of their content. This is a result of application of a ‘neighbouring right’ for news which was transposed into national law following a pan-EU copyright reform agreed back in 2019.The tech giant had sought to evade paying French publishers for reuse of snippets of content in its news aggregation and search products by no longer displaying them in the country.But\xa0in April last year the French competition watchdog (FCA) quashed its attempt to avoid payments, using an urgent procedure known as interim measures — deeming Google’s unilateral withdrawal of snippets to be unfair and damaging to the press sector, and likely to constitute an abuse of a dominant market position.A few months later Google lost an appeal against the watchdog’s injunction ordering it to negotiate with publishers over reuse of content — leaving it little choice but to sit at the table with French newspapers and talk payment.L’Alliance de la Presse d’Information Générale (APIG), which represents the interests of around 300 political and general information press titles in France, announced the framework agreement today, writing that it sets the terms of negotiation with its members for Google’s reuse of their content.In a statement, Pierre Louette, CEO of Groupe Les Echos – Le Parisien, and president of L’Alliance, said: “After long months of negotiations, this agreement is an important milestone, which marks the effective recognition of the neighboring rights of press publishers and the beginning of their remuneration by digital platforms for the use of their online publications.”L’@Alliance_Presse et @GoogleEnFrance signent un accord relatif à l'utilisation des publications de presse en ligne pic.twitter.com/t2QEeBMwX3— AlliancePresse (@Alliance_Presse) January 21, 2021Google has also put out a blog post — lauding what it said is a “major step forward” after months of negotiations with French publishers.The agreement “establishes a framework within which Google will negotiate individual licensing agreements with IPG certified publishers within APIG’s membership, while reflecting the principles of the law”, it said.IPG certification refers to a status that online media organizations in France can gain if they meet certain quality standards, such as having at least one professional journalist on staff and having a main purpose of creating permanent and continuous content that provides political and general information of interest to a wide and varied audience.“These agreements will cover publishers’ neighboring rights, and allow for participation in News Showcase, a new licencing program recently launched by Google to provide readers access to enriched content,” Google added, making reference to a news partnership program it announced last year — which it said would have an initial $1BN investment.Google to pay out $1B to publishers to license content for new Google News ShowcaseGoogle has not confirmed how much money will be distributed to publishers in France solely under the agreed framework over content reuse which is directly linked to the neighbouring right.And the News Showcase program which Google spun up quickly last year looks conveniently designed to help it obfuscate the value of individual payments it may be legally required to make to publishers for reusing their content.The tech giant told us it is in conversations with publishers in many countries to negotiate agreements for News Showcase — a program that is not limited to the EU.It also said earlier investments announced with publishers under Showcase come as it anticipates legal regimes that may exist once the EU’s copyright directive is implemented in other countries, adding that it will evaluate laws as and when they are introduced.(NB: France was among the first EU countries to the punch to transpose the copyright directive; application of the neighbouring right will expand across the bloc as other Member States bake the directive into national law.)On the French agreements specifically, Google said they are for its News Showcase but are also inclusive of the publisher’s neighboring rights, after we asked about the separation between payments that will be made under the French framework and Google’s News Showcase. So about as clear as mud, then.The tech giant did tell us it has reached individual agreements with a handful of French publishers so far, including (major national newspaper titles) Le Monde, Le Figaro and Libération.It added that payments will go direct to publishers and terms will not be disclosed — noting they are strictly confidential. It also said these individual deals with publishers take account of the neighbouring right framework but also reflect individual publisher needs and differences.On criteria for payments for neighbouring rights, Google’s blog post states: “The remuneration that is included in these licensing agreements is based on criteria such as the publisher’s contribution to political and general information (IPG certified publishers), the daily volume of publications, and its monthly internet traffic.”On this, Google also told us it is focused on IPG publishers because the French law is too (it pointed to a line of the law that states: “The amount of this remuneration takes into account elements such as human, material and financial investments made by publishers and press agencies, the contribution to press publications to political and general information and the importance of use of press publications by online public communication services.”)But it added that its door remains open to discussion with other non APIG publishers.The tech giant was also keen to emphasize that French law and the EU copyright directive do not require consent for the use of links or “very short extracts”, adding that it’s paying for online use on its surfaces for publisher content that goes beyond links and very short extracts — such as a News Showcase panel curated by the publisher.“We are paying for content beyond links and very short extracts,” the tech giant also told us.Google must negotiate to pay for French news, appeals court confirmsWe also reached out to L’Alliance with questions. A spokesman for the group told us the agreement covers around 120+ of its publisher members at present but noted that figure is likely to evolve. He also confirmed all IPG certified publishers are eligible.On the extent of the neighbouring rights’ coverage the spokesman said snippets displayed in Google News would clearly not fall under the exception for\xa0“isolated words or very short extracts” — pointing out that the directive also states the exception should not be interpreted in a way that impacts the effectiveness of neighboring rights.The task of assessing whether or criteria is being fulfilled will be undertaken jointly by the Alliance and publishers, per the spokesman, who noted that the withdrawal of its complaint in front of the FCA is conditional upon this check for 30 publishers.Payments will commence once the complaint is settled and Showcase is launched, he added, without providing a timeframe.While individual payments to publishers under the French framework are not being disclosed the agreement looks like a major win for Europe’s press sector — which had lobbied extensively to extend copyright to news snippets via the EU’s controversial copyright reform.Some individual EU Member States — including Germany and Spain — previously attempted to get Google to pay publishers by baking similar copyright provisions into national law. But in those instances Google either forced publishers to give it their snippets for free (by playing traffic-hungry publishers off against each other) or shut down Google News entirely. So some payment is clearly better than nada.That said, with details of the terms of individual deals not disclosed — and no clarity over exactly how remunerations will be calculated — there’s a lot that remains murky over Google paying for news reuse.Neither Google nor L’Alliance have said how much money will be distributed in total under the French agreement to covered publishers, for example.\xa0Another issue we’re curious about is how the framework will protect publishers from changes to Google’s search algorithms that could have a negative impact on traffic to their sites.This seems important given that monthly traffic is one of the criteria being used to determine payment. (And it’s not hard to find examples of such negative search ‘blips’.)However, according to the Alliance’s spokesman, Google has committed to a certain level of remuneration for the duration of the agreement (three years). As a result he said it did not believe traffic and changes in algorithms would be an issue for the payment arrangement.He also pointed out the FCA is still investigating Google over complaints of a dominant position — noting other organizations also filed a complaint, so even when the publishing group withdraws its own there’s grounds for that investigation to continue.Still, it looks clear that the more publishers Google can attract into its ‘News Showcase’ program, the more options Google will have for displaying news snippets in its products — and therefore at a price it has more power to set. So the longer term impact of the application of the EU’s copyright directive on publisher revenues — and, indeed, how it might influence the quality of online journalism that Google accelerates into Internet users’ eyeballs — remains to be seen.As noted above, the French competition watchdog’s investigation is ongoing — and Google told us it continues to engage with that probe — so its business practices remain under continued and close scrutiny, limiting its operational wiggle room for now.In a separate intervention in 2019 the national watchdog slapped Google with a €150 million fine for abusing its dominant position in the online search advertising market — sanctioning it for “opaque and difficult to understand” operating rules for its ad platform, Google Ads, and for applying them in “an unfair and random manner.”While, last October, the US Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against Google — alleging that the company is “unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising”.The UK’s competition watchdog has also raised concerns about the ad market dominance of Google and Facebook, asking\xa0for views on breaking up Google back in 2019. The UK government has since said it will establish a pro-competition regulator to put limits on big tech.France’s competition watchdog orders Google to pay for news reuseThis report was updated with additional information and an on the record comment from Google, as well as additional information from L’Alliance""]",Springbox AI,"['NavigationClose', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Google’s', 'de la Presse d’Information Générale', 'APIG', 'Google’s', 'Pierre Louette', 'Groupe Les Echos –', 'AlliancePresse', 'Google', 'IPG', 'APIG’s', 'IPG', 'Google', 'Google News ShowcaseGoogle', 'News Showcase', 'Google', 'News Showcase', 'Showcase', 'EU', 'EU', 'Google', 'News Showcase', 'Google’s News Showcase', 'Le Figaro', 'Google’s', 'IPG', 'Google', 'IPG', 'APIG', 'EU', 'News Showcase', 'IPG', 'Google News', 'Alliance', 'FCA', 'Showcase', 'EU', 'EU', 'Google', 'Google News', 'Google’s', 'Alliance’s', 'Google', 'FCA', 'Google', 'Google', 'Google Ads', 'Justice Department', 'Google', 'L’AllianceclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Cornet is its first female partner. Eight Roads is backed by Fidelity and has over $6 billion assets under management globally.Cornet will be focusing on the software and fintech sectors and previously led a number of investments for the firm, having risen from associate to partner within five years. It’s an out of the ordinary career trajectory, as VC is notorious for having a “no succession” culture, unless partners effectively buy into funds.Cornet commented: “I am hugely optimistic about what is to come for European technology entrepreneurs. We are seeing more and more amazing founders and innovative businesses across the whole European region with ambitions and abilities to become global champions, and I look forward to helping them scale up.”Speaking with TechCrunch, Cornet added: “I feel so, so fortunate because I think we’ve been living during a once in a lifetime transformation in general in tech and also in Europe. To build some of those companies, and just be part of the ecosystem has been fantastic. I know how much more exciting things are going to be in the next couple of years.”Cornet previously led investments into Spendesk, the Paris-based spend management platform; Thinksurance, the Frankfurt-based B2B insurtech; and Compte-Nickel, one of the first European neobanks that was successfully acquired by BNP Paribas in 2017. She also sits on the boards of VIU Eyewear, OTA Insight and Fuse Universal.France-born Cornet’s previous career includes investment banking, Summit Partners, and she joined Eight Roads Ventures in 2015. She was a “rising star” at the GP Bullhound Investor of the Year Awards 2020.Commenting, Davor Hebel, managing partner at Eight Roads Ventures Europe, said: “We are delighted with Lucile’s success so far at Eight Roads. She has made a huge impact in Europe and globally since joining the firm. She has a tremendous work ethic and drive… identifying the best European companies and helping them scale into global winners. Her promotion also speaks to our desire to continue to develop our best investment talent and promote from within.”Eight Roads Ventures launches new $375M scale-up fund for European and Israeli startupsSpeaking to me in an interview, Hebel added: “We always believed in a slightly different approach and we say when we hire people, even from the start, we want them to have judgment, and we want them to have that presence when they meet entrepreneurs. So it was always part of the model for us to say, we might not hire many people, but we really want them to have the potential to grow and stay with us and have the path and the potential to do so.”In 2020, Eight Roads Ventures Europe invested in Cazoo, Otrium, Spendesk, Odaseva and most recently Tibber, completed eight follow-on investments and exited Rimilia.

https://t.co/63GSyqyvhP,2021-01-21T12:01:34,"Israel’s startup ecosystem powers ahead, amid a year of change","['Released in 2011, “Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel’s Economic Miracle” was a book that laid claim to the idea that Israel was an unusual type of country. It had produced, and was poised to produce, an enormous number of technology startups, given its relatively small size. The moniker became so ubiquitous, both at home and abroad, that “Israel Startup Nation” is now the name of the country’s professional cycling team.But it’s been hard to argue against this position in the last 10 years, as the country powered ahead, famously producing ground-breaking startups like Waze, which was eventually picked up by Google for more than $1 billion in 2013. Waze’s 100 employees received about $1.2 million on average, the largest payout to employees in Israeli high tech at the time, and the exit created a pool of new entrepreneurs and angel investors.Israel’s heady mix of questioning culture, tradition of national military service, higher education, the widespread use of English, appetite for risk and team spirit makes for a fertile place for fast-moving companies to appear.And while Israel doesn’t have a Silicon Valley, it named its high-tech cluster “Silicon Wadi” (“wadi” means dry desert river bed in Arabic and colloquial Hebrew).After a record year for Israeli startups, 16 investors tell us what’s nextMuch of Israel’s high-tech industry has emerged from former members of the country’s elite military intelligence units, such as the Unit 8200 Intelligence division. From age 13 Israel’s students are exposed to advanced computing studies, and the cultural push to go into tech is strong. Traditional professions attract low salaries compared to software professionals.Israel’s startups industry began emerging in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A significant event came with acquisition by AOL of the the ICQ messaging system developed by Mirabilis. The Yozma Programme (Hebrew for “initiative”) from the government, in 1993, was seminal: It offered attractive tax incentives to foreign VCs in Israel and promised to double any investment with funds from the government. This came decades ahead of most western governments.It wasn’t long before venture capital firms started up and major tech companies like Microsoft, Google and Samsung had R&D centers and accelerators located in the country.So how are they doing?At the start of 2020, Israeli startups and technology companies were looking back on a good 2019. Over the last decade, startup funding for Israeli entrepreneurs increased by 400%. In 2019 there was a 30% increase in startup funding and a 102% increase in M&A activity. The country was experiencing a six-year upward funding trend. And in 2019, Bay Area investors put $1.4 billion into Israeli companies.2020 was a record year for Israel’s security startup ecosystemBy the end of last year, the annual Israeli Tech Review 2020 showed that Israeli tech firms had raised a record $9.93 billion in 2020, up 27% year on year, in 578 transactions — but M&A deals had plunged.Israeli startups closed out December 2020 by raising $768 million in funding. In December 2018 that figure was $230 million, in 2019 it was just under $200 million.Late-stage companies drew in $8.33 billion, from $6.51 billion in 2019, and there were 20 deals over $100 million totaling $3.26 billion, compared to 18 totaling $2.62 billion in 2019.Top IPOs among startups were Lemonade, an AI-based insurance firm, on the New York Stock Exchange; and life sciences firm Nanox, which raised $165 million on the Nasdaq.The winners in 2020 were cybersecurity, fintech and Internet of Things, with food tech coming on strong. But while the country has become famous for its cybersecurity startups, AI now accounts for nearly half of all investments into Israeli startups. That said, every sector is experiencing growth. Investors are also now favoring companies that speak to the COVID-era, such as cybersecurity, e-commerce and remote technologies for work and healthcare.There are currently more than 30 tech companies in Israel that are valued over $1 billion. And four startups passed the $1 billion valuation just last year: mobile game developer Moon Active; Cato Networks, a cloud-based enterprise security platform; ride-hailing app developer Gett got $100 million ahead of its rumored IPO; and behavioral biometrics startup BioCatch.And there was a reminder that Israel can produce truly “magical” tech: Tel Aviv battery storage firm StoreDot raised money from Samsung Ventures and Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for its battery which can fully charge a motor scooter in five minutes.Quick-charging battery startup StoreDot gets $60M on $500M valuation led by DaimlerUnfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic put a break on mergers and acquisitions in 2020, as the world economy closed down.M&A was just $7.8 billion in 93 deals, compared to over $14.2 billion in 143 M&A deals in 2019. RestAR was acquired by American giant Unity; CloudEssence was acquired by a U.S. cyber company; and Kenshoo acquired Signals Analytics.And in 2020, Israeli companies made 121 funding deals on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and global capital markets, raising a total of $6.55 billion, compared to $1.95 billion raised in capital markets in Israel and abroad in 2019, as IPOs became an attractive exit alternative.However, early-round investments (seed and A rounds) slowed due to pandemic uncertainty, but picked up again toward the end of the year. As in other countries in “COVID 2020”, VC tended to focus on existing portfolio companies.COVID brought unexpected upsides: Israeli startups, usually facing longs flight to Europe or the U.S. to raise larger rounds of funding, suddenly found that Zoom was bringing investors to them.Israeli startups adapted extremely well in the COVID era, and that doesn’t look like it’s changing. Startup Snapshot found that 55% of startups profiled had changed (or considered changing) their product due to COVID-19. Meanwhile, remote-working — which comes naturally to Israeli entrepreneurs — is “flattening” the world, giving a great advantage to normally distant startup ecosystems like Israel’s.Via Transportation raised $400 million in Q1. Next Insurance raised $250 million in Q3. Seven exit transactions with over the $500 million mark happened in Q1-Q3/2020, compared to 10 for all of 2019. These included Checkmarx for $1.1 billion and Moovit, also for a billion.There are three main hubs for the Israeli tech scene (in order of size): Tel Aviv, Herzliya and Jerusalem.Jerusalem’s economy and therefore startup scene suffered after the second Intifada (the Palestinian uprising that began in late September 2000 and ended around 2005). But today the city is far more stable, and is therefore attracting an increasing number of startups. And let’s not forget visual recognition company Mobileye, now worth $9.11 billion (£7 billion), came from Jerusalem.Extra Crunch membership now available to readers in IsraelIsrael’s government is very supportive of its high-tech economy. When it noticed seed-stage startups were flagging, the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) announced the launch of a new funding program to help seed-stage and early-stage startups, earmarking NIS 80 million ($25 million) for the project.This will offer participating companies grants worth 40% of an investment round up to $1.1 million and 50% of a total investment round for startups in the country or whose founders come from under-represented communities — Arab Israeli, ultra-Orthodox and women — in the high-tech industry.Investments in Israeli seed-stage startups decreased both absolutely and as a percentage of total investments in Israeli startups (to 6% from 11%). However, the decline may also be a function of large tech firms setting up incubation hubs to cut up and absorb talent.Another notable aspect of Israel’s startups scene is its, sometimes halting, attempt to engage with its Arab Israeli population. Arab Israelis account for 20% of Israel’s population but are hugely underrepresented in the tech sector. The Hybrid Programme is designed to address this disparity.It, and others like it, is a reminder that Israel is geographically in the Middle East. Since the recent normalization pact between Israel and the UAE, relations with Arab states have begun to thaw. Indeed, more than 50,000 Israelis have visited the United Arab Emirates since the agreement.In late November, Dubai-based DIFC FinTech Hive — the biggest financial innovation hub in the Middle East — signed a milestone agreement with Israel’s fintech (Aviv). Both entities will now work together to facilitate the cross-border exchange of knowledge and business between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.Perhaps it’s a sign that Israel is becoming more at ease with its place in the region? Certainly, both Israel’s tech scene and the Arab world’s is set to benefit from these more cordial relations.Our Israel survey is here.

Even more interesting, the Raspberry Pi Foundation is using its own RP2040 chip, which means that the foundation is now making its own silicon.If you’re not familiar with microcontrollers, those devices let you control other parts or other devices. You might think that you can already do this kind of stuff with a regular Raspberry Pi. But microcontrollers are specifically designed to interact with other things.They’re cheap, they’re small and they draw very little power. You can start developing your project with a breadboard to avoid soldering. You can pair it with a small battery and it can run for weeks or even months. Unlike computers, microcontrollers don’t run traditional operating systems. Your code runs directly on the chip.Like other microcontrollers, the Raspberry Pi Pico has dozens of input and output pins on the sides of the device. Those pins are important as they act as the interface with other components. For instance, you can make your microcontroller interact with an LED light, get data from various sensors, show some information on a display, etc.The Raspberry Pi Pico uses the RP2040 chip. It has a dual-core Arm processor (running at 133MHz), 264KB of RAM, 26 GPIO pins including three analog inputs, a micro-USB port and a temperature sensor. It doesn’t come with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. And it costs $4.If you want to run something on the Raspberry Pi Pico, it’s quite easy. You plug your device to your computer using the micro-USB port. You boot up the Raspberry Pi Pico while pressing the button. The device will appear on your computer as an external drive.Raspberry Pi Foundation announces Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB of RAMIn addition to C, you can use MicroPython as your development language. It’s a Python-inspired language for microcontrollers. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has written a ton of documentation and a datasheet for the Pico.Interestingly, the Raspberry Pi Foundation wants to let others benefit from its own chip design. It has reached out to Adafruit, Arduino, Pimoroni and Sparkfun so that they can build their own boards using the RP2040 chip. There will be an entire ecosystem of RP2040-powered devices.This is an interesting move for the Raspberry Pi Foundation as it can go down this path and iterate on its own chip design with more powerful variants. It provides two main advantages —\xa0the ability to control exactly what to put on board, and price.Image Credits: Raspberry Pi Foundation']",skin cancer detection,"['Raspberry Pi Foundation', 'NavigationClose', 'Raspberry Pi FoundationMeet', 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'the Raspberry Pi Foundation', 'Raspberry Pi', 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'KB', 'RAM', 'GPIO', 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'Raspberry Pi Foundation', 'Raspberry Pi', 'The Raspberry Pi Foundation', 'the Raspberry Pi Foundation', 'Adafruit', 'Arduino', 'Sparkfun', 'the Raspberry Pi Foundation', 'Raspberry Pi FoundationclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'PiRaspberry Pi FoundationRaspberry Pi', 'Raspberry Pi Pico', 'the Raspberry Pi Foundation', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/O1nN2fbMpk,2021-01-21T09:00:54,Porsche and Axel Springer increase investment into early-stage fund APX to €55M,"['Berlin-based early-stage fund APX today announced that its two investors, European publisher Axel Springer and sports car maker Porsche, have increased their investment in the fund to a total of €55 million.With this, APX, which launched in 2018, is now able to deploy up to €500,000 in pre-Series A seed funding per company. That’s up from up to €100,000 when the fund launched. So far, the group has invested in more than 70 companies and plans to increase this number to close to 200 by 2022.When APX launched, the fund didn’t disclose the total investment from Porsche and Axel Springer. Today, the team said that the new investment “more than doubles APX’s total amount for investing in new and current companies.” APX also stressed that the total volume of the fund is now “at least” €55 million, in part because the investors can always allocate additional funding for outliers.In addition to the new funding, APX also today announced that it is doing away with its 100-day accelerator program and instead opting for a long-term commitment to its companies, including participation in future rounds.“We will try and invest into 50 or more companies this year — and we were at 35 last year. So this is quite some growth,” APX founding managing director (and folk music aficionado) Henric Hungerhoff told me. “We think that our deal flow systems and our entire operations are settled in well enough that we can have quality founders in our portfolio. That’s our goal — and that might even increase to 70 the year after. […] We see really nice synergies or network effects within our portfolio, with founders helping other founders and learning from each other.”Image Credits: APXHungerhoff tells me that the team is quite confident in its ability now to identify quality deal flows. The team is using a data-driven approach. And while it leverages its own network and that of its founders, it has also set up a scout program at leading European universities to identify potential founders, for example.As APX founding managing director, and the former CEO of Axel Springer’s Plug and Play accelerator, Jörg Rheinboldt noted, APX never asks its founders to pitch. Instead, the team has multiple conversations with them about the product they want to build, how they came up with the idea — and how it changed over time.“And then, we do multiple things simultaneously,” Rheinboldt said. “One is, we look at team dynamics. How do the founders interact? We also stress them a little bit — in a friendly way — where someone asks very fast questions, or we focus a little bit on one person and see how the others rescue them. We want to know about the team dynamics and then we want to understand the strategy, how we can help them best?”The idea here is to be able to invest quickly. In addition, though, with the new funding, the team isn’t just able to invest into more companies but also invest more into the individual companies.Image Credits: APX“We want to invest deeper per startup at a very early stage,” Hungerhoff said. “So far, […] our typical approach was a non-dilution, pro-rata follow-on strategy with most of our portfolio companies. And this is something we want to pledge in the future. Looking at the past, 100% of the times in equity rounds, we do the pro-rata follow-on or more, but now, we have developed a strategy that we will, for the fastest-moving of fastest-growing companies, deploy significantly more cash in a very early phase, which means an amount of up to €500,000.”What the team saw was that the companies in its portfolio would raise a small pre-seed round from APX and other investors, with APX typically taking a 5% stake in the startup. Most founders would then go on and raise extended pre-seed or seed rounds soon thereafter.“We more felt like we missed out when we saw these companies raising really nice financing rounds and we did our investment,” Rheinbolt said. “We felt very good that we can do a pro-rata investment. but we looked at each other and said: we knew this, we knew that they would do this 12 weeks ago. We could have given them a check and maybe the round would have been done in eight weeks and maybe [our stake] wouldn’t be 5% but 7%.”Given this new focus on supporting startups throughout their lifecycle, it’s no surprise that APX did away with the 100-day program as well. But the team still expects to be quite hands-on. With a growing network, though, the partners also expect that founders will be able to learn from each other, too. “We now see the value that is coming from this,” Hungerhoff said. For example, a team that we’ve invested in two months ago, they’re now thinking about the angel round. They can actually get the best advice on this — or just experienced sharing — from another team, rather than talking to Jörg who did this maybe 30 years ago — no offense.”The team also spends a lot of time thinking about its community, which now includes founders from 20 countries. The COVID pandemic has obviously moved most of the interactions online. Before COVID, APX often hosted events in its offices, which helped create the kind of serendipity that often leads to new ideas and connections. Looking ahead, the team still believes that there is a lot of value in having face-to-face meetings, but at the same time, maybe not every company needs to move to Berlin and instead visit for a few days every now and then.‘The money is still there,’ says APX managing director Jörg RheinboldtBonus: Here is Hungerhoff’s latest album with St. Beaufort.

https://t.co/cF94yAgm4D,2021-01-21T09:00:18,Softr scores $2.2M seed for its no-code website and web app platform powered by Airtable,"['No-code — software that lets you accomplish tasks that previously required coding skills — is an increasingly hot space, even if the basic premise has been promised and not fully realised for many years. Related to this are companies like Airtable, which attempt to make building relational databases and interrogating them as easy as creating a spreadsheet. Now Softr, a startup out of Berlin, wants to push the no-code concept further by making it easy to build websites on top of Airtable without the need to write code.Recently soft-launched on Product Hunt, today the young company is disclosing $2.2 million in seed funding, having previously been bootstrapped by its two Armenian founders, CEO Mariam Hakobyan and CTO Artur Mkrtchyan. Leading the round is Atlantic Labs, along with Philipp Moehring (Tiny.VC) and founders from GitHub, SumUp, Zeitgold, EyeEm and Rows.Started in 2019, Softr has built a no-code platform to enable anybody to build websites and web apps based on data housed in Airtable. The idea is to let Airtable do the database grunt work, combined with Softr’s relatively flexible but template-driven approach to website and web app creation.Softr’s Hakobyan explains that out of the box the startup offers templates for anything from a simple marketing website to web apps for an e-commerce store, job board, marketplace and more. Those applications can include functionality like user authentication, gated content, payments, upvoting and commenting, etc.“Softr has zero learning curve and can literally be used by anyone without a tech background, as it abstracts away all the technical aspects and focuses the user on product building and content, rather than technology,” she explains. “Softr uses Airtable as the database, as it makes it easy creating and sharing relational databases, without having to learn SQL or scripting. Airtable has gotten pretty popular in the last few years and is used not only by individuals but also Fortune 500 companies”.Image Credits: SoftrTo that end, Hakobyan says Softr’s magic is that it uses the concept of “pre-built building blocks” (listings, user accounts, payments, etc.) and business logic to handle most of the heavy lifting on behalf of the website creator. “When using blocks and templates… 70% of the work is already done for the user,” she explains.In addition, Softr connects to popular services like Stripe, PayPal, Mailchimp, Zapier, Integromat, Hotjar, Google Analytics, HubSpot, Drift and others.Softr is currently used by “several thousands of makers and startups”. Examples of applications that customers have built on Softr include a language learning school with membership, a babysitters’ booking marketplace and a community with gated content and online courses.Armed with capital, Softr plans to expand its customer base to non-tech functions of SMBs to help them build internal tooling, such as employee directories, product inventories, real estate listings, etc., and to automate manual processes.']",Jetsons Robotics,"[""AirtableSteve O'Hear@sohear / 10:00 AM"", 'Product Hunt', 'Mariam Hakobyan', 'Atlantic Labs', 'Philipp Moehring', 'VC', 'GitHub', 'SumUp', 'Zeitgold', 'EyeEm', 'Rows', 'Softr’s Hakobyan', 'SQL', 'Mailchimp', 'Zapier, Integromat', 'HubSpot', 'Drift', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropeFundings & ExitsRecent FundingStartupsTCAtlantic', ""AirtableSteve O'Hear10:00 AM"", 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/kk1j3Anzv2,2021-01-21T05:57:57,This startup says its AI can better spot a healthy embryo — and improve IVF success,"['With every year, AI is beginning to bring more standardized levels of diagnostic accuracy in medicine. This is true of skin cancer detection, for example, and lung cancers.Now, a startup in Israel called Embryonics says its AI can improve the odds of successfully implanting a healthy embryo during in vitro fertilization. What the company has been developing, in essence, is an algorithm to predict embryo implantation probability, one they have trained through IVF time-lapsed imaging of developing embryos.It’s just getting started, to be clear. So far, in a pilot involving 11 women ranging in age from 20 to 40, six of those individuals are enjoying successful pregnancies, and the other five are awaiting results, says Embryonics.Still, Embryonics is interesting for its potential to shake up a big market that’s been stuck for decades and continues to grow only because of external trends, like millennial women who are putting off having children owing to economic concerns.Consider that the global in vitro fertilization market is expected to grow from roughly $18.3 billion in 2019 to nearly double that number in the next five years by some estimates. Yet the tens of thousands of women who undergo IVF each year have long faced costs of anywhere from $10,000 to $15,000 per cycle (at least in the U.S.), along with long-shot odds that grow worse with age.Kegg, a connected fertility tracker and Kegel trainer for women, launches out of betaIndeed, it’s the prospect of reducing the number of IVF rounds and their attendant expenses that drives Embryonics, which was founded three years ago by CEO Yael Gold-Zamir, an M.D. who studied general surgery at Hebrew University, then became a researcher in an IVF laboratory owing to an abiding interest in the science behind fertility.As it happens, she would be introduced to two individuals with complementary interests and expertise. One of them was David Silver, who had studied bioinformatics at the prestigious Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and who, before joining Embryonics last year, spent three years as a machine learning engineer at Apple and three years before that as an algorithm engineer at Intel.The second individual to whom Gold-Zamir was introduced was Alex Bronstein, a serial founder who spent years as a principal engineer with Intel and who is today the head of the Center for Intelligent Systems at Technion, as well as involved with several efforts involving deep learning AI, including at Embryonics and at Sibylla, a nascent outfit focused on algorithmic trading in capital markets.Embryonics currently remains a small outfit, but the three, along with 13 full-time employees who’ve joined them, appear to be making progress.Fueled in part by $4 million in seed funding led by the Shustermann Family Investment Office and the Israeli Innovation Authority, Embryonics says it’s about to receive regulatory approval in Europe that will enable it to sell its software — which the team says can better recognize patterns in small cell clusters than a human — to fertility clinics across the continent.Using a database with millions of anonymized patient records from different centers around the world, says Gold-Zamir, the company is already eyeing next steps, too. Most notably, beyond moving into the U.S. with its embryo analysis software, Embryonics wants to work with fertility clinics on improving what’s called hormonal stimulation.As Bronstein observes, every woman who goes through IVF or fertility preservation goes through the process — which involves getting injected with hormones from 8 to 14 days — to induce their ovaries to produce as many mature eggs as possible. But right now, there are just three general protocols and a “lot of trial and error in trying to establish the right one,” he says. Through deep learning, Embryonics thinks it can begin to understand both the right mix of hormones each individual should be taking, as well as the different times they should be taken.And there’s more in the works if all goes as planned. “Embryonics’s goal is to provide a holistic solution, covering all aspects of the process,” says Gold-Zamir, who is raising four children of her own, along with running the company.It’s too soon to say whether the nascent outfit will succeed. But it certainly seems to be at the forefront of a technology that is fast changing after more than 40 years wherein many IVF clinics worldwide have simply assessed embryo health by looking at days-old embryos on a petri dish under a microscope to assess their cell multiplication and shape.In the spring of 2019, investigators from Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City published own their conclusion \xa0that AI can evaluate embryo morphology more accurately than the human eye after using 12,000 photos of human embryos taken precisely 110 hours after fertilization to train an algorithm to discriminate between poor and good embryo quality.Femtech poised for growth beyond fertilityThe investigators said that each embryo was first assigned a grade by embryologists that considered various aspects of the embryo’s appearance. The investigators then performed a statistical analysis to correlate the embryo grade with the probability of a successful pregnancy outcome. Embryos were considered good quality if the chances were greater than 58% and poor quality if the chances were below 35%.After training and validation, the algorithm was able to classify the quality of a new set of images with 97% accuracy.\xa0']",,"['AI', 'IVF', 'NavigationClose', 'AI', 'IVF successConnie Loizos@cookie /', 'Tammy Bar-ShayWith', 'AI', 'Embryonics', 'AI', 'IVF', 'Embryonics', 'Embryonics', 'IVF', 'Kegg', 'Kegel', 'IVF', 'Yael Gold-Zamir', 'Hebrew University', 'IVF', 'David Silver', 'Technion-Israel Institute of Technology', 'Embryonics', 'Apple', 'Intel', 'Gold-Zamir', 'Alex Bronstein', 'Intel', 'the Center for Intelligent Systems', 'Technion', 'AI', 'Embryonics', 'Sibylla', 'Embryonics', 'the Shustermann Family Investment Office', 'the Israeli Innovation Authority', 'Embryonics', 'Gold-Zamir', 'Embryonics', 'Bronstein', 'IVF', 'Embryonics', 'Gold-Zamir', 'IVF', 'Weill Cornell Medicine', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'AI', 'IVF', 'Loizos6:57 AM', 'AI', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The company is also getting a new name and will be called Indy going forward. The startup has been building an accounting automation application for freelancers and small companies.Singular is leading today’s funding round. You might not be familiar with Singular, but it makes a ton of sense to see the VC firm on the cap table. Former Alven partners Jeremy Uzan and Raffi Kamber left the Paris-based VC firm to raise their own fund. Uzan previously invested in Indy when he was at Alven and he’s following up with Singular.Existing investors Alven and Kerala are also investing once again. Overall, Indy has managed to attract 40,000 clients who pay a monthly subscription fee to access the service.Indy first started with a product specifically designed for freelancers, self-employed people, doctors, architects, lawyers, etc. It can help you replace your accountant altogether. You first connect the service to your bank account. Indy then imports all your transactions and tries to tag and categorize as many transactions as possible.You can go back and add missing data. You also can add receipts or invoices right next to your transactions. Once this is done, you know how much VAT you’re supposed to get back at the end of the year.Indy then automatically fills out administrative forms based on your data. You can then download your tax documents or send them directly from Indy.You can also use the platform to get an overview of your business. You can see your corporate revenue, track your expenses, and see how much you earn per year based on personal expenses and your own pay.Over time, Indy has expanded its service so that it supports more types of companies. In addition to freelancers, Indy supports EURL, SARL, SAS and SASU. In 2020, the startup has tripled its revenue.And the company plans to improve its product to support even more self-employed people, including people selling stuff under the BIC status in France. Indy plans to hire 100 people in 2021 in Lyon.Indy has even bigger plans, as it has been evaluating the U.S. as a potential market.

So it made sense to work with the Indian company on new form factors and applications for its charging technologies.Indeed, the consumer market that Powermat had hoped to capture had been, by that point, broadly commoditized, so the tech developer needed a new direction.Cleaning rooftop solar installations can be a costly endeavor, running companies anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 per year, according to Jetsons Robotics chief executive, Jatin Sharma. The use of robots to replace human labor can save money, but the autonomous solution that the company wanted to build necessitated some kind of wireless charging dock, he said.Contact-based charging meant too many variables in the outdoor environment, but an inductive charger would be too costly. Until the company worked with Powermat on a solution, Sharma said.Backed by 100X.VC, Sharma’s robots are already cleaning roughly 1.7 megawatts of solar installations on a daily basis.For Powermat, the solar cleaning robots are a good test of the company’s new industrial focus, according to chief technology officer Itay Sherman.“You can look at it like maturation of the market,” Sherman said. “Powermat had been a pioneer in driving wireless technology. This market is maturing and we are moving on to markets where the technology and innovation is important. We have decided to shift our efforts to these emerging markets. Robotics is one, medical devices, IOT, and the automotive market are others.”']",Share on Twitter ,"['Powermat', 'Jetsons Robotics', 'NavigationClose', 'Powermat', 'Jetsons Robotics', 'Powermat', 'Powermat', 'Jatin Sharma', 'Powermat', 'Powermat', 'Itay Sherman', 'Sherman', 'IOT', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Powermat', 'Shieber6:12 AM', 'Jetsons Robotics', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/p0joc9FSAc,2021-01-21T03:16:08,Digital securities platform iSTOX closes $50 million Series A to make private equity accessible to more investors,"['Oi Yee Choo, chief commercial officer of digital securities platform iSTOX. Image Credits: iSTOXISTOX, a digital securities platform that wants to make private equity investment more accessible, has added new investors from Japan to its Series A round, bringing its total to $50 million. Two of its new backers are the government-owned Development Bank of Japan and JIC Venture Growth Investments, the venture capital arm of Japan Investment Corporation, a state-backed investment fund.Other participants included Juroku Bank and Mobile Internet Capital, along with returning investors Singapore Exchange, Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings and Hanwha Asset Management.Founded in 2017 and owned by blockchain infrastructure firm ICHX, iSTOX’s goal is to open private capital opportunities, including startups, hedge funds and private debt, that are usually limited to a small group of high-net-worth individuals and more institutional and accredited investors. (It also serves accredited investors outside of Singapore, as long as they meet the country’s standards by holding the equivalent amount in assets and income.) ISTOX allows users to make investments as small as SGD $100 (about USD $75.50) and says it is able to keep fees low by using blockchain technology for smart contracts and to hold digital securities, which makes the issuance process more effective and less costly.ISTOX’s Series A round was first announced in September 2019, when the company said it had raised an undisclosed amount from Thai investment bank Kiatnakin Phatra Financial Group while participating in the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) FinTech Regulatory Sandbox. The Singaporean government has been especially supportive of blockchain technology, launching initiatives to commercialize its use in fintech, data security, logistics and other sectors.Singapore’s government launches blockchain innovation program with $8.9 million in fundingISTOX completed the sandbox program in February 2020, and was approved by the MAS for the issuance, custody and trading of digitized securities. The new funding will be used for geographical expansion, including in China, where it already has an agreement in the city of Chongqing, and Europe and Australia, where it is currently working on issuance deals. ISTOX also plans to add new investment products, including private issuances that investors can subscribe to in “bite-size portions.”In a press statement, iSTOX chief commercial officer Oi Yee Choo said, “Capital markets are transforming rapidly because of advancements in technology. The regulator MAS and our institutional investors have been far-sighted and progressive, and they support the change wholeheartedly.”The company is among several Asia-based fintech platforms that want to democratize the process of investing. For retail investors, there are apps like Bibit, Syfe, Stashaway, Kristal.ai and Grab Financial’s investment products.Because iSTOX works with accredited and institutional investors, however, its most direct competitors include the recently launched DBS Digital Exchange, which is also based in Singapore. ISTOX’s advantage is that it offers more kinds of assets. Right now, it facilitates the issuance of funds and bonds, but this year, it will start issuing private equity and structured products as well. The company’s securities are also fully digitized, which means they are created on the blockchain, instead of being recorded on the blockchain after they are issued, which means iSTOX is able to offer faster settlement times.Indonesian robo-advisor app Bibit raises $30 million led by Sequoia Capital India']",Genflow,"['Digital', 'NavigationClose ScreenDigital', 'Shu@catherineshu', 'CommentOi Yee Choo', 'Development Bank of Japan', 'JIC Venture Growth Investments', 'Japan Investment Corporation', 'Juroku Bank', 'Mobile Internet Capital', 'Singapore Exchange', 'Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings', 'Hanwha Asset Management', 'ICHX', 'SGD $100', 'Kiatnakin Phatra Financial Group', 'the Monetary Authority of Singapore', 'FinTech Regulatory Sandbox', 'MAS', 'Oi Yee Choo', 'MAS', 'Kristal.ai', 'Grab Financial’s', 'DBS Digital Exchange', 'Bibit', 'Sequoia Capital IndiaclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCAsiablockchainDevelopment Bank of Japandigital securitiesinvestingiSTOXJIC Venture Growth', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Last year, India’s antitrust group gave a go-ahead to the deal to the Indian firms.“We hereby advise that we have no adverse observations with limited reference to those matters having a bearing on listing/de-listing/continuous listing requirements within the provisions of Listing Agreement, so as to enable the company to file the scheme with Hon’ble NCLT [National Company Law Tribunal],” the notification read. SEBI has advised Future to share various aspects of its ongoing litigation with Amazon to NCLT, whose approval for the deal is pending.India’s Reliance Retail to acquire Future Group’s units for $3.4 billionAmazon bought 49% stake in one of Future’s unlisted firms in 2019 in a deal that was valued at over $100 million. As part of the deal, Future could not have sold assets to rivals, Amazon has said in court filings.Things changed last year after the coronavirus pandemic starved the Indian firm of cash, Future Group chief executive and founder Kishore Biyani said at a recent virtual conference. In August, Future Group said that it had reached an agreement with Ambani’s Reliance Industries, which runs India’s largest retail chain, to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses for $3.4 billion.Amazon later protested the deal by reaching an arbitrator in Singapore and asked the court to block the deal between the Indian retail giants. Amazon secured emergency relief from the arbitration court in Singapore in late October that temporarily halted Future Group from going ahead with the sale.The two estranged partners also fought at the Delhi High Court last year, which in a rare glimmer of hope for the American giant rejected Future’s plea for an ad-interim injunction to restrain Amazon from writing to regulators and other authorities to raise concerns over — and halt — the deal between the two Indian giants.Indian court rejects retail giant Future Group’s plea against AmazonAn Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that the firm will continue to pursue legal remedies.\xa0“The letters issued by BSE & NSE clearly state that the comments of SEBI on the ‘draft scheme of arrangement’ (proposed transaction) are subject to the outcome of the ongoing Arbitration and any other legal proceedings. We will continue to pursue our legal remedies to enforce our rights,” the spokesperson said.At stake is India’s retail market that is estimated to balloon to $1.3 trillion by 2025, up from $700 billion in 2019, according to consultancy firm BCG and local trade group Retailers’ Association India.

David is passionate about open-source and infrastructure software and previously worked in the Technology Investment Banking Group at Morgan Stanley.\tMore posts by this contributorBottom-up SaaS: A framework for mapping pricing to customer valueMany of today’s most successful software companies, from Atlassian and Datadog to Zoom, subscribe to the bottom-up SaaS go-to-market model. In this model, the user purchases software directly from a website, without ever speaking to a sales person. The product essentially sells itself.The bottom-up model has a few key benefits: Companies spend dramatically less on sales than their peers, allowing them to invest more in product; they can sustain hypergrowth for longer because they are not as reliant on raw sales headcount to win business; and they tend to be more profitable in the long run, leading to premium valuations.For all these reasons, more and more SaaS startups are choosing to adopt the bottom-up go-to-market model. But for every Atlassian or Zoom, there are many more companies that fail — often because they don’t understand the hidden challenges and costs that come with the bottom-up model.Before proceeding further, it’s important to note that bottom-up is not the right starting strategy for every company. A few quick ways to see if bottom-up is the right place to start for you:Product: People can easily try your product.Decision-maker: Your decision-maker is a line-level employee (not C-Suite).Users: Teams and individuals can get value from your product (doesn’t have to be full enterprise roll-out).Data: The data involved isn’t something that compliance would need to review.For companies that meet these criteria, there are three important questions that you must be able to answer:Who needs to work together to make a bottom-up SaaS model work?What is the value you deliver to your customer and how do you determine pricing that matches that value?When do you hire a sales team? (Spoiler alert — it’s sooner than you think!)In this piece, we will tackle each of those questions in turn and share some of the best answers we’ve seen from companies that are making it work.Who needs to work together to make a bottom-up SaaS model work?Unlike most traditional companies who rely on a head of sales to keep tabs on customers and how much each one is paying, most successful bottom-up companies rely on a combination of product, sales, customer support, marketing and community teams to manage revenue.']",drawing TechCrunch’s attention,"['David Cahn', 'Hiroshi Watanabe', 'Getty ImagesCaryn MarooneyContributorShare', 'Caryn Marooney', 'Coatue Management', 'Facebook, Instagram', 'WhatsApp', 'Oculus', 'The OutCast Agency', 'Salesforce.com', 'Amazon', 'David', 'the Technology Investment Banking Group', 'Morgan Stanley', 'SaaS', 'Zoom', 'Spoiler', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Caryn Marooney', 'David Cahn2:15 PM GMT+1•October 28', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/m37mBZU89M,2021-01-21T00:01:01,Genflow nabs $11M investment from BGF,"['Genflow, a London and LA-based brand-building agency that offers an e-commerce and mobile tech platform to let influencers start companies, has raised $11 million in funding.Leading the round is U.K. investor BGF. The injection of capital will be used by Genflow to further scale its offering and for international expansion.Founded in 2016 by entrepreneur Shan Hanif to help social media influencers develop their brands and extract revenue from their audiences, Genflow combines aspects of a traditional branding agency — such as strategy, design and planning — and a tech company with its own software stack.This sees Genflow position itself as a brand-as-a-service (BaaS) platform, which helps influencers develop their own digital and physical products instead of promoting other brands, and enables them to launch their own membership club, gated community, mobile app or direct to consumer brand.“Genflow offers the complete infrastructure from design, development, manufacturing and logistics through to strategy, marketing and content creation to drive revenue and profit,” explains the company.Out of the box influencer strategies to accelerate awareness for your startupGenflow says its client base are established influencers who typically have large followings on Instagram and YouTube.“Genflow allows an influencer to start their own business instead of the traditional brand deals so if someone with an audience wants truly their own audience and business Genflow does that for them,” says Hanif. “We provide them the complete infrastructure to launch a business: design, manufacturing, development, content, strategy and marketing all in one place. This gives us the unique ability to execute to a very high level that drives revenue”.Hanif says influencers typically approach Genflow either with an idea or when they need help figuring out what brand they can launch. “We use ‘Genlytics,’ our in-house built software, to see what the best brand they can release by checking their analytics, breakdown of their followers, what brands they have worked with in the past and to see how much they can potentially sell,” he explains.Next, Genflow onboards the client and begins the brand building process, offering broadly two options: Gated content, membership clubs, community and mobile apps, or developing direct to consumer brand with physical products.The first is akin to having your own OnlyFans, Patreon or social media platform. The second is a classic D2C e-commerce play and includes designing the products, and working with factories to create samples, manufacture the products and then handle all logistics etc.In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 followers“In both cases then we plan the launch of the brand, the marketing strategy and then work with the influencer to launch the brand itself,” adds Hanif.“What’s interesting is that traditionally in startups you find a problem, get a team, some funding then try to find customers. What we have invented is the ‘audience first approach’ where we already have the audience and now just need the right products and it’s instantly a success. The metrics that I see for our brands are not normal: conversion rates that are 5-30%, 20% repeat purchase buys and around 6:1 return on Facebook ads.“We are proud that every brand we have launched to date is profitable and growing year on year so we know our approach works.”\xa0']",Curtsy,"['BGF', 'NavigationClose', 'BGF', 'Genflow', 'Shan Hanif', 'Genflow', 'Genflow', 'Instagram', 'YouTube', 'Genflow', 'Hanif', 'Hanif', 'Genflow', 'Genlytics', 'Genflow', 'OnlyFans', 'Patreon', 'Hanif', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropeFundings & ExitsRecent', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

After all, how big could the OKR software market really be?It’s a subniche of corporate planning tools! In a world where every company already pays for Google or Microsoft’s productivity suite, and some big software companies offer similar planning support, how substantial could demand prove for pure-play OKR startups?The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.Pretty substantial, we’re finding out. After OKR-focused Gtmhub announced its $30 million Series B the other day, The Exchange reached out to a number of OKR-focused startups we’ve previously covered and asked about their 2020 growth.Gtmhub had released new growth metrics along with its funding news, plus we had historical growth data from some other players in the space. So let’s peek at new and historical numbers from Gthmhub, Perdoo, WorkBoard, Ally.io, Koan\xa0and WeekDone.Growth (and some caveats)A startup growing 400% in a year from a $50,000 ARR base is not\xa0impressive. It would be much more impressive to grow 200% from $1 million ARR, or 150% from $5 million.So, percentage growth is only so good, as metrics go. But it’s also one that private companies are more likely to share than hard numbers, as the market has taught startups that sharing real data is akin to drowning themselves. Alas.As we view the following, bear in mind that a simply higher percentage growth number does not indicate that a company added more net ARR than another; it could be growing faster from a smaller base. And some companies in the mix did not share ARR growth, but instead disclosed other bits of data.

The app, which evolved out of an earlier effort for renting dresses, now allows women to list their clothes, shoes and accessories for resale, while also reducing many of the frictions involved with the typical resale process.The new round was led by Index Ventures, and included participation from Y Combinator, prior investors FJ Labs and 1984 Ventures, and angel investor Josh Breinlinger (who left Jackson Square Ventures to start his own fund).To date, Curtsy has raised $14.5 million, including over two prior rounds, which also included investors CRV, SV Angel, Kevin Durant, Priscilla Scala and other angels.Like other online clothing resale businesses, Curtsy aims to address the needs of a younger generation of consumers who are looking for a more sustainable alternative when shopping for clothing. Instead of constantly buying new, many Gen Z consumers will rotate their wardrobes over time, often by leveraging resale apps.Image Credits: CurtsyHowever, the current process for listing your own clothes on resale apps can be time-consuming. A recent report by Wired, for example, detailed how many women were spinning their wheels engaging with Poshmark in the hopes of making money from their closets, to little avail. The Poshmark sellers complained they had to do more than just list, sell, package and ship their items — they also had to participate in the community in order to have their items discovered.Curtsy has an entirely different take. It wants to make it easier and faster for casual sellers to list items by reducing the amount of work involved to sell. It also doesn’t matter how many followers a seller has, which makes its marketplace more welcoming to first-time sellers.“The big gap in the market is really for casual sellers — people who are not interested in selling professionally,” explains Curtsy CEO David Oates. “In pretty much every other app that you’ve heard about, pro sellers really crowd out everyday women. Part of that is the friction of the whole process,” he says.Peer-to-peer dress rental startup Curtsy lets you rent out your wardrobeOn Curtsy, the listing process is far more streamlined.The app uses a combination of machine learning and human review to help the sellers merchandise their items, which increase their chances of selling. When sellers first list their item in the app, Curtsy will recommend a price, then fill in details like the brand, category, subcategory, shipping weight and the suggested selling price, using machine learning systems training on the previous items sold on its marketplace. Human review fixes any errors in that process.Also before items are posted, Curtsy improves and crops the images, as well as fixes any other issues with the listing, and moderates listings for spam. This process helps to standardize the listings on the app across all sellers, giving everyone a fair shot at having their items discovered and purchased.Another unique feature is how Curtsy caters to the Gen Z to young Millennial user base (ages 15-30), who are often without shipping supplies or even a printer for producing a shipping label.Image Credit: Curtsy / Photo credit: Brooke RayFirst-time sellers receive a free starter kit with Curtsy-branded supplies for packaging their items at home, like poly mailers in multiple sizes. As they need more supplies, the cost of those is built into the selling flow, so you don’t have to explicitly pay for it — it’s just deducted from your earnings. Curtsy also helps sellers to schedule a free USPS pickup to save a trip to the post office, and it will even send sellers a shipping label, if need be.“One of the things we realized quickly is Gen Z does not really have printers. So we actually have a label service and we’ll send you the label in the mail for free from centers across the country,” says Oates.Later, when a buyer of an item purchased from Curtsy is ready to resell it, they can do so with one tap — they don’t have to photograph it and describe it again. This also speeds up the selling process.Poshmark is pushing into the public market at a high-end valuation as the resale market sizzlesOverall, the use of technology, outsourced teams who improve listings and extra features like supplies and labels can be expensive. But Curtsy believes the end result is that they can bring more casual sellers to the resale market.“Whatever costs we have, they should be in service of increased liquidity, so we can grow faster and add more people,” Oates says. “In case of the label service, those are people who otherwise wouldn’t be able to participate in selling online. There’s no other app that would allow them to sell without a printer.”Image Credits: CurtsyThis system, so far, appears to be working. Curtsy now has several hundred thousand people who buy and sell on its iOS-only app, with an average transaction rates of three items bought or sold per month. When the new round closed late in 2020, the company was reporting a $25 million GMV revenue run rate, and average monthly growth of around 30%. Today, Curtsy generates revenue by taking a 20% commission on sales (or $3 for items under $15).The team, until recently, was only five people — including co-founders David Oates, William Ault, Clara Agnes Ault and Eli Allen, plus a contract workforce. With the Series A, Curtsy will be expanding, specifically by investing in new roles within product and marketing to help it scale. It will also be focused on developing an Android version of its app in the first quarter of 2021 and further building out its web presence.“Never before have we seen such a strong overlap between buyers and sellers on a consumer-to-consumer marketplace,” said Damir Becirovic of Index Ventures, about the firm’s investment. “We believe the incredible love for Curtsy is indicative of a large marketplace in the making,” he added.']",Share on Twitter ,"['Gen Z', 'NavigationClose', 'Gen Z', 'ASarah Perez@sarahintampa', 'Curtsy / Photo', 'Brooke RayCurtsy', 'Index Ventures', 'Y Combinator', 'FJ Labs', 'Josh Breinlinger', 'Jackson Square Ventures', 'Curtsy', 'SV Angel', 'Kevin Durant', 'Priscilla Scala', 'Curtsy', 'Curtsy', 'Curtsy', 'David Oates', 'Curtsy', 'Curtsy', 'Curtsy', 'Curtsy', 'Curtsy', 'the Gen Z', 'Curtsy / Photo', 'Brooke RayFirst-time', 'Curtsy', 'Curtsy', 'USPS', 'Gen Z', 'Curtsy', 'Curtsy', 'Curtsy', 'GMV', 'Curtsy', 'David Oates', 'William Ault', 'Clara Agnes Ault', 'Eli Allen', 'Android', 'Damir Becirovic', 'Index Ventures', 'Curtsy', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Gen Z', 'ASarah Perez10:39 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/iPbNTQ4xTq,2021-01-11T21:41:25,Flexible VC: A new model for startups targeting profitability,"['David TetenContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tDavid Teten is founder of Versatile VC and writes periodically at teten.com and @dteten.\tMore posts by this contributor15 steps to fundraising a new VC or private equity fund12 ‘flexible VCs’ who operate where equity meets revenue shareJamie FinneyContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tJamie Finney is a founding partner at Greater Colorado Venture Fund, where he blogs about his work on VC and small communities. \r\n\tMore posts by this contributorFlexible VC: A new model for startups targeting profitabilityOf the Inc. 5000 companies, only 6.5% raised money from VCs and 7.7% raised from angels. Where else can fast-growing companies get funding?More and more startups are pursuing revenue-based VCs, but it’s not a good fit for everyone. A new category of investors has emerged offering a hybrid between VC and revenue-based investment (RBI), which we call “flexible VC.”From RBI, flexible VCs borrow the ability to reap meaningful returns without demanding founders build for an exit. From traditional equity VC, flexible VC borrows the option to pursue and reap the rewards of an outsized exit. Every flexible VC structure allows founders to access immediate risk capital while preserving exit, growth trajectory and ownership optionality. \n\t\t\tBefore raising capital, we encourage founders to dig into the nuances between different flexible VC structures.\t\t\t\t\tOur categorization is not a technical one. Rather, we want to accommodate the wide variety of instruments currently offered by flexible VC investors, detailed below. As two fund managers employing flexible VC, we think it is a healthy addition to the ecosystem and will yield more predictable and stable healthy returns for investors.Flexible VC 101: Equity meets revenue shareThis is currently the most common investment structure: The flexible VC investor purchases either equity ownership, or a convertible right to equity, and a right to regularly scheduled payments based on a percentage of revenues.By tying payments to actual revenues, founders and investors remain aligned around the company’s real-time performance, good or bad.“Too often, investment structures force the management team to make decisions between misaligned growth and investment (return) objectives. This structure allows for alignment on the front end, and real-time flexibility for performance metrics,” says Samira Salman, a family office investor and advisor.Payments are commonly delayed for a grace period of 12-36 months. John Berger, director of Operations and Impact Solutions at Toniic, observed that this has clear investor benefits: “The grace period became a feature because it benefits investors in regions like the U.S. where there can be tax differences between short- and long-term gains. It has moved from its origins as a tax benefit and can be viewed as a feature that benefits founders.” After the grace period, the return payments begin, often lasting until a return cap is hit, such as 2-5 times the original investment.To account for these revenue share payments, the investor’s ownership (or convertible right to ownership) is simultaneously reduced. Once the return cap is reached, the investor is typically left with a residual stake — a fraction of the pre-revenue share ownership. At any point, should the founder wish to pursue a traditional equity VC round, or get bought, the revenue share is paused, and the investor’s then-current ownership converts to equate to a traditional equity VC investor.Flexible VC 102: VariationsFlexible VCs have created structures based on other company performance metrics than revenues, such as profits or founder salaries. These different company performance metrics provide a slight variation in how the investor and founder relationship is defined. For example, profit-sharing structures ensure payments do not begin until the company is profitable, though likely delaying returns to the investor and complicating payment calculations.Similarly, when flexible VC structures are based off of the founder’s own compensation (often via salary or dividends), investors are specifically tying their returns to the financial success of the founder. This translates less directly to company performance compared to a revenue or profit share, but offers uniquely personal alignment. These variations in founder alignment allow flexible VCs to specialize in the types of companies they work with.The state of flexible VCIn all these cases, capital is provided to fuel forecasted growth without creating a commitment to a particular vision for future funding rounds, exit goals and associated blitzscaling. The founder retains full control over whether they want to optimize for hypergrowth (usually at the expense of profitability) or for organic, profitable growth. Flexible VC opens up a new risk capital option for bootstrappers, minorities, family-owned and countless other founder segments left out by the traditional funding landscape.A range of small VCs are deploying with flexible VC structures, but we believe the total amount of AUM deployed with this strategy is well under $50 million. Similar to the explosion of seed funds in the past decade, we (and some limited partners too) believe these Flexible VCs are on the forefront of what will become a major segment of the venture ecosystem.We detail below the major categories of VC:Funder categoryEquity ownershipReturns primarily based on\xa0Composition of returnsExample VCEquity VCYes, typically preferred equity.15%-20% sold per round. On average, founders own just 43% of equity by Series B, declining thereafter.The value ascribed by subsequent investors (in a secondary); buyers (acquisition); or the public markets (IPO).Volatile, uncapped.Andressen Horowitz, ff Venture Capital, HOF Capital, Sequoia.Flexible VC: Revenue-basedYes, nonvoting common shares (if converted).5%-20% initial stake, with 50%-90% of this redeemable.Gross revenues (generally 2%-8%).2x-5x return cap + path to uncapped equity returns.Capacity Capital, Greater Colorado Venture Fund, Indie.VC, Reformation Partners, UP Fund, Versatile VC.Flexible VC: Compensation-basedYes, via conversion rights at a valuation cap.“Founder earnings” (Founder salaries + dividends + retained earnings).2x-5x return cap + path to uncapped equity returns.Chisos.Flexible VC: Blended ReturnYes, via conversion rights at a valuation cap.Profits, founder salaries, and/or dividends declared.Typically ~3x+ return cap + path to uncapped equity returns. Discretionary dividends and salary share built in.Collab Capital, Earnest Capital, TinySeed.Revenue-share investingNo.Gross revenues (generally 2%-8%).1.35x-2.2x return cap.Novel Growth Partners, Lighter Capital, Rev Up, Corl.Flexible VC versus other venture capital modelsFlexible VC investors offer founders some of the same advantages as equity VCs:Aligned incentives.\xa0Whether it is a breakout success or complete failure and loss of capital, investors are along for the ride. When the company hits potholes, flexible VC investors usually don’t have the nuclear options of firing management and/or doing a recapitalization. Their only option is to work with management to try to fix the problems.Few strings attached.\xa0Founders have autonomy to spend the funds in whatever way they like.Long-term alignment.\xa0Many flexible VCs retain a small residual stake in the company after the return cap is reached, driving alignment well beyond the horizon of the revenue share, similar to the long-term orientation of equity VC.Seed-stage compatible. Like traditional equity VC investors, flexible VCs accommodate early-stage investment risk within their portfolios better than a traditional RBI funder.Eligible for favorable treatment under qualified small business stock exemption, if structured as equity. This applies if the investment converts into common stock; details are beyond this essay’s scope.Flexible VCs also offer investors some of the same advantages as RBI:Clear return expectations.\xa0The return cap is a stated multiple of the investment, typically 2x-5x.Early liquidity. Equity VC is a “get rich slow” business. Flexible VC creates early liquidity that can be either reinvested or distributed to LPs.Improved financial management. All parties want the company to be able to afford the payment obligations and, ideally, deliver a quick return. As a result, unfounded hockey-stick graphs and unicorn promises give way to financial fluency, realistic expectations, frank conversations about what a business can credibly achieve and transparency.Profitability is prioritized.\xa0The revenue that is going to grow the company immediately is the same revenue that is going to get investors to their return cap. If the company is profitable, the revenue share becomes increasingly affordable. This drives an earlier focus on profitability than is typical for a company backed by traditional equity VC.Founder retains control. Flexible VCs typically purchase nonvoting common stock, if they purchase stock (one even assigns their voting rights to the founders). This keeps the founder in the driver’s seat of the company.Attractive to women and underrepresented founders. See Why Are Revenue-Based Investors Investing in Women & Diverse Entrepreneurs?Flexible VC also offers some unique advantages:Straightforward equity interface.\xa0If an equity round is needed to fund breakout growth beyond what the flexible VC funds, the mechanics of including a flexible VC in an equity VC round are predetermined and simple.Prepared for blitzscaling, but neither required nor expected.\xa0Blitzscaling typically means prioritizing user growth over revenue growth and revenue growth over profitability. Tim O’Reilly, CEO, O’Reilly Media, argues, “Blitzscaling isn’t really a recipe for success but rather survivorship bias masquerading as a strategy.” With flexible VC, not every company is expected to achieve breakout growth, but that possibility is accounted for up front.Particular application in impact capital. Our research has found that impact investors appear to be particularly interested in flexible VC. An impact investor typically needs some economic return to function, but doesn’t necessarily want the company as a whole to exit, given exits often have a negative impact on the company’s founding mission. Flexible VC allows impact VCs to thread this needle.That said, nothing is cost-free.

https://t.co/daGmC8kZi1,2021-01-20T21:11:43,African edtech startup uLesson lands a $7.5 million Series A,"['ULesson, an edtech startup based in Nigeria that sells digital curriculum to students through SD cards, has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding. The round is led by Owl Ventures, which closed over half a billion in new fund money just months ago. Other participants include LocalGlobe and existing investors, including TLcom Capital and Founder Collective.The financing comes a little over a year since uLesson closed its $3.1 million seed round in November 2019. The startup’s biggest difference between now and then isn’t simply the millions it has in the bank, it’s the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its entire value proposition.ULesson launched into the market just weeks before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic. The startup, which uses SD cards as a low-bandwidth way to deliver content, saw a wave of smart devices enter homes across Africa as students adapted to remote education.“The ground became wet in a way we didn’t see before,” founder and CEO Sim Shagaya said. “It opens up the world for us to do all kinds of really amazing things we’ve wanted to do in the world of edtech that you can’t do in a strictly offline sense,” the founder added.Similar to many edtech startups, uLesson has benefited from the overnight adoption of remote education. Its positioning as a supplementary education tool helped it surface 70% month over month growth, said Shagaya. The founder says that the digital infrastructure gains will allow them to “go online entirely by Q2 this year.”Sim Shagaya’s uLesson African edtech startup raises $3.1MIt costs an annual fee of $50, and the app has been downloaded more than 1 million times.With fresh demand, Shagaya sees uLesson evolving into a live, online platform instead of an offline, asynchronous content play. The startup is already experimenting with live tutoring: it tested a feature that allowed students to ask questions while going through pre-recorded material. The startup got more than 3,000 questions each day, with demand so high they had to pause the test feature.“We want you to be able to push a button and get immediate support from a college student sitting somewhere in the continent who is basically a master in what you’re studying,” he said. The trend of content-focused startups adding on a live tutoring layer continues when you look at Chegg, Quizlet, Brainly and others.The broader landscapeE-learning startups have been booming in the wake of the coronavirus. It’s led to an influx of tutoring marketplaces and content that promises to serve students. One of the most valuable startups in edtech is Byju’s, which offers online learning services and prepares students for tests.But Shagaya doesn’t think any competitors, even Byju’s, have cracked the nut on how to do so in a digital way for African markets. There are placement agencies in South Africa and Kenya and offline tutoring marketplaces that send people to student homes, but no clear leader from a digital curriculum perspective.Owl Ventures’ new pair of funds gives edtech a $585 million boost“Everybody sees that Africa is a big opportunity,” Shagaya said. “But everybody also sees that you need a local team to execute on this.”Shagaya thinks the opportunity in African edtech is huge because of two reasons: a young population, and a deep penetration of private school-going students. Combined, those facts could create troves of students who have the cash and are willing to pay for supplementary education.The biggest hurdle ahead for uLesson, and any edtech startup that benefitted from pandemic gains, is distribution and outcomes. ULesson didn’t share any data on effectiveness and outcomes, but says it’s in the process of conducting a study with the University of Georgia to track mastery.“Content efforts and products [will] live or die at the altar of distribution,” Shagaya said. The founder noted that in India, for example, pre-recorded videos do well due to social nuances and culture. ULesson is trying to find the perfect sauce for videos in markets around Africa and embed that into the product.']","White House, dark mode: Biden admin refreshes presidency’s website, vows accessibility","['uLesson', 'NavigationClose ScreenAfrican', 'uLesson', 'ANatasha', 'Owl Ventures', 'LocalGlobe', 'TLcom Capital', 'Founder Collective', 'uLesson', 'ULesson', 'the World Health Organization', 'Sim Shagaya', 'uLesson', 'Shagaya', 'Shagaya’s', 'Shagaya', 'uLesson', 'Byju’s', 'Shagaya', 'Byju’s', 'Shagaya', 'uLesson', 'ULesson', 'the University of Georgia', 'Shagaya', 'ULesson', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'uLesson', 'ANatasha', 'Owl Ventures', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/6PH76JEZWM,2021-01-18T16:43:08,"It may not be as glamorous as D2C, but beauty tech is big money","['Sindhya ValloppillilContributorShare on Twitter Sindhya Valloppillil is the founder and CEO of Skin Dossier, a venture partner at Next Gen Ventures, a freelance writer and formerly a beauty industry executive and marketing professor.\r\n\r\n\tLast week, Procter & Gamble (P&G) announced that it was terminating plans to acquire razor startup Billie following a U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit to stop the deal.Last year, Edgewell Personal Care ditched its debt-heavy $1.37 billion deal for Harry’s, Inc, formerly valued at $1 billion after the FTC sought to block the acquisition.In addition to these FTC challenges, it is also now becoming clear that relying on VC-subsidized products and celebrating outrageous valuations can be problematic for D2C brands. With a few wonderful and rare exceptions such as Rothy’s (which raised $42 million but was profitable from the beginning and generated $140 million in revenue within two years of launching), D2C unicorns are addicted to the cycle of venture funding to feed growth in order to maintain a high valuation multiple. \n\t\t\tThe path to profitability has become a more important part of the startup story versus growth at all costs.\t\t\t\t\tThis works for a while; however, when the path to profitability appears murky and exit options either don’t appear or only appear from nontech companies with very conservative multiples, the walls start crumbling.In a WWD article, Odile Roujol, the former CEO of Lancôme who launched venture fund\xa0FAB Ventures, said, “Generally speaking, the era of $1 billion valuations for beauty companies is over. The people that struggle have been the companies that spend so much money in just a few years.” She went on to say, “The big corporations now … are not ready to spend $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion on such a brand like Glossier.”This change in sentiment from acquirers is further fueled by recent research on the challenges of turning hypergrowth companies profitable. In his Harvard Business School case study “Direct to Consumer Brands,” Professor Sunil Gupta wrote, “Acquiring DTC brands is easy for incumbent conglomerates, but making them profitable is challenging. More than three years after Unilever acquired Dollar Shave Club, it was still unprofitable.”Unilever executives learned that the average cost of acquiring a new customer online was about the same as in stores. David Taylor, CEO of P&G, said his company was still figuring out how to turn recently acquired direct-to-consumer brands into profitable businesses.Taylor summarized this dilemma, saying, “There are many, many launches that grow fast … a business model that makes money is a higher challenge.” Since making these realizations, incumbent conglomerates will be more cautious when considering the acquisition of hyped D2C brands that raised lots of venture capital.Beauty tech is a better bet: Meitu and Perfect Corp.What’s cooler than beauty companies that are (or were) valued at $1 billion? Beauty tech SaaS companies that are worth $5.2 billion at IPO. We don’t hear much about the leading global beauty tech companies such as Meitu and Perfect Corp. because their founders are not celebrity influencers, they don’t have massive Instagram followings here in the U.S. and they are not celebrated in our media.

https://t.co/qiRnLpafwL,2021-01-14T19:54:58,5 consumer hardware VCs share their 2021 investment strategies,"['Consumer hardware has always been a tough market to crack, but the COVID-19 crisis made it even harder.TechCrunch surveyed five key investors who touch different aspects of the consumer electronics industry, based on our TechCrunch List of top VCs recommended by founders, along with other sources.We asked these investors the same six questions, and each provided similar thoughts, but different approaches:Hans Tung, managing partner, GGV CapitalDayna Grayson, co-founder and general partner, Construct CapitalCyril Ebersweiler, general partner, SOSVBilal Zuberi, partner, Lux CapitalRob Coneybeer, managing director, Shasta VenturesDespite the pandemic, each identified bright spots in the consumer electronic world. One thing is clear, investors are generally bullish on at-home fitness startups. Multiple respondents cited Peloton, Tonal and Mirror as recent highlights in consumer electronics.Said Shasta Venture’s Rob Coneybeer, “With all due respect to my friends at Nest (where Shasta was a Series A investor), Tonal is the most exciting consumer connected hardware company I’ve ever been involved with.”Besides asking about the trends and opportunities they’re pursuing in 2021, the investors we spoke to also identified other investors, founders and companies who are leaders in consumer hardware and shared how they’ve reshaped their investment strategies during the pandemic. Their responses have been edited for space and clarity.Hans Tung, GGV CapitalWhich consumer hardware sector shows the most promise for explosive growth?For consumer hardware, offering end users a differentiated experience is extremely important. Social interactions, gamification and high-quality PGC (professionally generated content) such as with Peloton, Xiaomi and Tonal is a must to drive growth. It’s also easy to see how the acceleration of the digital economy created by COVID-19 will also drive growth for hardware.First, services improved by the speed and reliability of 5G such as live streaming, gaming, cloud computing, etc. will create opportunity for new mobile devices and global mass market consumers will continue to demand high-quality, low-cost hardware. For example, Arevo is experimenting with “hardware as a service” with a 3D printing facility in Vietnam.For enterprise hardware, security, reliability and fast updates are key competitive advantages. Also as a result of 5G… manufacturing automation and industrial applications. Finally IoT for health and safety may find its sweet spot thanks to COVID-19 with new wearables that track sleep, fitness and overall wellness.How did COVID-19 change consumer hardware and your investment strategy?One opportunity for consumer hardware companies to consider as a result of COVID-19 is how they engage with their customers. They should think of themselves more like e-commerce companies, where user experience, ongoing engagement with the consumer and iteration based on market feedback rule the day. While Peloton had this approach well before COVID, it has built a $46 billion company thinking about their products in this way.For example, some consumers felt the bike was too expensive so instead of responding with a low-end product, the company partnered with Affirm to make their hardware more affordable with pay-as-you-go plans. A Peloton bike is not a one-and-done purchase; there is constant interaction between users, and the company that drives more satisfaction in the hardware adds more value in the business.Entering 2021, in what way is hardware still hard?Hardware is still hard because it takes more to iterate fast. The outcome for competitors relative to speed-to-market can be dramatic. For example, every year I look at future generation of EVs with lots of innovations and cool features from existing OEMs but see very few of these making it to market compared to Tesla and other pure players that are cranking out vehicles. Their speed of execution is impressive.Who are some leaders in consumer hardware — founders, companies, investors?John Foley, founder and CEO of Peloton. John and the Peloton team have cracked the code on the integration of community experience and hardware.Sonny Vu, founder of Misfit and founder/CEO of Arevo, maker of ultrastrong, lightweight continuous carbon fiber products on demand.

https://t.co/nTT94Hmg7U,2021-01-20T20:01:42,Amazon offers Biden resources for COVID-19 vaccine rollout,"['Following Joseph Biden’s swearing in as the 46th president of the United States, Amazon is offering help in the administration’s stated goals for rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine. In a letter provided to TechCrunch, Worldwide Consumer CEO Dave Clark congratulates Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, while promising, “to assist you in reaching your goal of vaccinating 100 million Americans in the first 100 days of your administration.”The note references a pledge set by Biden while introducing members of the pandemic team during a press conference in December of last year.“My first 100 days won’t end the COVID-19 virus. I can’t promise that,” the then-president-elect said. “But we did not get in this mess quickly, we’re not going to get out of it quickly, it’s going to take some time. But I’m absolutely convinced that in 100 days we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better.”More recently, COVID-19 task force member epidemiologist Michael Osterholm called the goal “aspirational […] but doable,” adding that it would take time to ramp up.In his letter, Clark details Amazon’s response to the virus, as many warehouse and other workers were employed throughout as essential workers. Included in the resources on offer are deals with healthcare providers who can administer vaccines on-site.“We have an agreement in place with a licensed third-party occupational health care provider to administer vaccines on-site at our Amazon facilities,” Clark writes. “We are prepared to move quickly once vaccines are available. Additionally, we are prepared to leverage our operations, information technology, and communications capabilities and expertise to assist your administration’s vaccination efforts. Our scale allows us to make a meaningful impact immediately in the fight against COVID-19, and we stand ready to assist you in this effort.”White House, dark mode: Biden admin refreshes presidency’s website, vows accessibility\xa0']","Work From Home is dead, long live Work From Anywhere","['Amazon', 'Biden', 'NavigationClose', 'Biden', 'Mark Makela', 'Getty Images / Getty ImagesFollowing', 'Amazon', 'Worldwide Consumer', 'Dave Clark', 'Biden', 'Kamala Harris', 'Biden', 'Michael Osterholm', 'Clark', 'Amazon’s', 'Amazon', 'Clark', 'House', 'Biden', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'BidenvaccineAmazon', 'Biden', 'rolloutBrian Heater9:01 PM', 'Joseph Biden’s', 'Amazon', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/JwsvI3nc74,2021-01-20T19:31:47,TikTok’s new Q&A feature lets creators respond to fan questions using text or video,"['TikTok is testing a new video Q&A feature that allows creators to more directly respond to their audience’s questions with either text or video answers, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. The feature works across both video and livestreams (TikTok LIVE), but is currently only available to select creators who have opted into the test, we understand.Q&As have become a top way creators engage fans on social media, and have proven to be particularly popular in places like Instagram Stories and in other social apps like Snapchat-integrated YOLO, or even in smaller startups.On TikTok, however, Q&As are now a big part of the commenting experience, as many creators respond to individual comments by publishing a new video that explains their answer in more detail than a short, text comment could. Sometimes these answers are meant to clarify or add context, while other times creators will take on their bullies and trolls with their video responses. As a result, the TikTok comment section has grown to play a larger role in shaping TikTok trends and culture.Q&As are also a key means for creators to engage with fans when livestreaming. But it can be difficult for creators to keep up with a flood of questions and comments through the current live chat interface.F3, a Stories-style Q&A app for Gen Z teens, raises $3.9MSeeing how creators were already using Q&As with their fans is how the idea for the new feature came about. Much like the existing “reply to comments with video” feature, the Q&A option lets creators directly respond to their audience questions. Where available, users will be able to designate their comments as questions by tapping the Q&A button in a video’s comment field, or they can submit questions directly through the Q&A link on the creator’s profile page.For creators, the feature simplifies the process of responding to questions, as it lets them view all their fans’ questions in one place.There’s no limit to the number of questions that a creator can receive, though they don’t have to reply to each one.The feature was first spotted by social media consultant Matt Navarra, who posted screenshots of what the feature looks like in action, including how it appears on users’ profiles.New!

The pace of change is accelerating now, especially in Washington. At the time of this writing, Biden is expected to imminently launch a new legislative proposal for comprehensive immigration reform. As the world sits back and watches, we are focusing great collective attention on upgrading our political, sociological and technological structures so that each human has the chance to succeed.One of the things I adore about my practice of supporting international professionals with U.S. immigration is bearing witness to the process of individual transformation; it is an honor to support people in their personal journey from living in a world of effects to becoming the cause.The immediate focus of the proposed legislation is centered around a solution for Dreamers (who are in the U.S. without documentation) as well as supporting the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers and children. For more of my recent thoughts on this topic, check out my recent podcast explaining many of the changes. The draft bill is expected to span hundreds of pages, so please follow this Dear Sophie column for more updates as I track and explore the details, especially related to tech immigration.Innovation will be supported by many new immigration opportunities coming into greater focus. Biden’s campaign platform celebrated how “Immigrants are essential to the strength of our country and the U.S. economy.” The Biden team has prioritized immigration as a key focus within COVID, with an immediate goal of rewriting most Trump-era rules. For context, Trump issued more than 400 immigration-related executive orders and proclamations during his term.H-1Bs: Although H-1Bs have been in the news a lot regarding new wage rules changing the order of the lottery and litigation, the lottery is still happening this spring, and if you want to sponsor candidates, the time to act is now, regardless of what is happening in Washington.

https://t.co/RbB9NO6JrJ,2021-01-20T19:25:37,"Remote workers are greener, but their tech still has a real carbon cost","['The massive shift to remote work due to COVID-19 has resulted in a huge reduction in emissions from vehicles and other sources, but it comes with costs of its own. A new study puts tentative carbon costs on the connectivity and data infrastructure that make working from home possible — and gives you an excuse to leave the camera off.The researchers, from Purdue, Yale and MIT, attempted to analyze the carbon, land and water costs of internet infrastructure.“In order to build a sustainable digital world, it is imperative to carefully assess the environmental footprints of the Internet and identify the individual and collective actions that most affect its growth,” they write in the paper’s introduction.Using a single metric is too reductive, they argue: Carbon emissions are a useful metric, but it’s also important to track the sources of the power, the water cost (derived from what’s needed to cool and operate data centers) and the theoretical “land cost” needed to produce the product. If it sounds a little hand-wavy, that’s because any estimate along these lines is.Work From Home is dead, long live Work From Anywhere“In any calculation of this type at this global scale, you need to make a lot of assumptions and a lot of the data that you need are missing,” said lead study author, Yale’s Kaveh Madani, in an email to TechCrunch. “But it is a good start and best we could do using the available data.” (Madani noted that a lack of transparency in the industry, rather than a lack of statistical and scientific rigor, is the greater hindrance to the study’s accuracy.)An example of their findings is that an hour of HD video streaming produces up to 440 grams of Carbon Dioxide emissions — up to 1,000g for YouTube or 160g for Zoom and video conferencing due to differing video quality. For comparison, the EPA says a modern car produces 8,887 grams per gallon of gas. If you’re taking an hour of video meetings a day instead of commuting 20 miles to work, you’re definitely in the green, as it were, by an order of magnitude or more.Image Credits: Madani et alBut no one is arguing that the work from home shift or increase in digital consumption is a bad thing. “Of course, a virtual meeting is better for the environment than driving to a meeting location, but we can still do better,” said Madani.The issue is more that we think of moving bits around as having marginal environmental cost — after all, it’s bits being flipped or sent along fiber, right? Yes, but it’s also powered by enormous data centers, transmission infrastructure and, of course, the wasteful eternal cycle of replacing our devices — though that last one doesn’t figure into the paper’s estimates.If we don’t know the costs of our choices, we can’t make them in an informed way, the researchers warn.“Banking systems tell you the positive environmental impact of going paperless, but no one tells you the benefit of turning off your camera or reducing your streaming quality. So without your consent, these platforms are increasing your environmental footprint,” Madani said in a Purdue news release.Leaving your camera off for a call you don’t need to be visible for makes for a small — but not trivial — savings in carbon emissions. Similarly, lowering the quality on your streaming show from HD to SD could save almost 90% of the energy used to transmit it (though of course your TV and speakers won’t draw any less power).That doomscrolling habit, already a problem, seems even worse when you think that every flick of the thumb indirectly leads to a puff of hot, gross air out of a data center somewhere and a slight uptick in the air conditioning bill. Social media in general doesn’t use as much data as HD streaming, but the rise of video-focused networks like TikTok means they could soon catch up.Madani explained that, puff pieces writing misleading summaries of their research aside, the study does not prescribe any simple remedies like turning off your camera. Sure, you can and should, he argues, but the change we should be looking for is systemic, not individual. What are the chances millions of people will independently and regularly decide to turn off their cameras or lower the streaming quality from 4K to 720p? Pretty low.How to do remote work right, from the teams that know it bestBut on the other hand, if the costs of these services are made clear, as Madani and his team attempt to do in a preliminary way, perhaps pressure can be applied to the companies in question to make changes on the infrastructure side that save more energy in a day with an improved algorithm than 50 million people would with conscious decisions that they faintly resent.“Consumers deserve to know more about what is happening. People currently don’t know what is going on when they press the Enter button on their computers. When they don’t know, we can’t expect them to change behavior,” Madani said. “[Policy makers] should step in, raise concerns about this sector, try to regulate it, force increased transparency, impose pollution taxes and develop incentive mechanisms if they do not want to see another unsustainable, uncontrollable sector in the future.”The change to digital has created some amazing efficiencies and reduced or eliminated many wasteful practices, but in the process it has introduced new ones. That’s just how progress works — you hope the new problems are better than the old ones.The study was published in the journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling.']",WhiteHouse.gov,"['NavigationClose', 'Olivier Doiliery', 'COVID-19', 'Purdue, Yale', 'MIT', 'Anywhere“In', 'Yale’s Kaveh Madani', 'Madani', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'YouTube', 'Zoom', 'EPA', 'Madani', 'TikTok', '720p', 'Madani', 'Resources, Conservation', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Coldewey8:25 PM', 'COVID-19', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/aWgiDaFIki,2021-01-20T16:16:18,Joe Biden’s new gig,"[""Jim MessinaContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tJim Messina is a political and corporate advisor and CEO of The Messina Group. He previously served as the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and as the campaign manager for Obama's successful 2012 reelection campaign.\tAfter serving as Obama-Biden campaign manager and White House deputy chief of staff and now living in San Francisco and working with the tech sector, I am hopeful about the Biden-Harris administration’s ability to put in place smart policies and regulatory stability to further unleash the industry’s vast potential — not to mention the effect their calm and measured leadership could have on our greater economy.However, with new leadership comes new perspectives on many of the most critical issues facing Silicon Valley. While the bonds between the innovation economy and the Obama-Biden administration resulted in national prosperity, the tech sector is now intertwined in nearly every facet of American life.The resulting tension means the new administration will take its role as regulator seriously and investors and businesses alike should not overlook how quickly President Biden will move on policy — especially as it relates to the future of work and getting the U.S. economy back on track.There’s no question the gig companies had a banner year in 2020. Even with ride-hailing usage down dramatically, the strength of meal, grocery and just about everything else delivered combined with the victory in California of Proposition 22 has driven up market caps and positioned many startups for going public. Yet, while the West Coast may be feeling emboldened, the Beltway has another trajectory in mind.Congress has been working on gig worker classification legislation named the PRO Act for months. The bill closely mirrors the maligned California Assembly Bill 5 that Proposition 22 mostly reversed. It’s broadly supported by labor and could see some traction this year. Labor is already working hard to line up support from the various congressional coalitions, and at the same time gig economy companies are gearing up to fight it with their unlimited resources.The question is — what will President Biden do? Long ago he voiced his support for AB 5 and laid out plans to solve worker misclassification during the campaign, but he’s also hiring and appointing staff to the administration deeply experienced in tech. President Biden has been governing longer than most startup founders have been alive, he’s a master at understanding forces in Washington and how to reach a compromise. He knows that what’s rarely discussed during legislative debate is how the law will actually be implemented. \n\t\t\tWe shouldn’t be surprised if the Biden administration convenes the Department of Labor and the industry to determine how companies actually enact worker protections.\t\t\t\t\tDespite most bills being thousands of pages, they’re rarely prescriptive. Those details are left up to agencies. President Biden has oversight of the Department of Labor, which, if the PRO Act is passed, will be responsible for its implementation.We shouldn’t be surprised if the Biden administration convenes the Department of Labor and the industry to determine how companies actually enact worker protections. President Biden’s nominee for Labor Secretary, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, while a staunch supporter of labor, is also well-regarded by the business sector as someone they can work with and reach a compromise.We just have to look to the states to understand why this outcome is so plausible. The gig companies already have Proposition 22-type campaigns underway in six states and are running legislation in a half dozen more. By the end of 2021 there will be law on the books codifying worker protections in nearly a third of the country, modeled on Proposition 22.This kind of momentum is hard to ignore and labor knows it. Although labor is aligned in its support of the PRO Act, the alignment becomes blurry when considering state action. For example, many northeastern states have had a thriving black car and taxi industry for decades.This means labor’s position on gig laws in New York and New Jersey are quite different than places like Washington state or Illinois where gig workers are still relatively new and the ink is drying on regulations supported by Uber and Lyft just a few years ago. Labor is aligned as much as they can be and enough to support the PRO Act, but there isn’t a national movement and that leaves room for compromise.This is all good news for the tech sector. It’s a fantasy to think that regulation wouldn’t eventually come to protect the very workers who power the gig economy. And that’s a good thing — tech has a moral responsibility to do right by its workers. However, those regulations shouldn’t and won’t be imposed on tech. Rather it will take weeks and months of campaigns and bills winding their way through the states and Congress, culminating with negotiations and compromises.Or maybe even years of renewed regulatory processes. All of which will be overseen by a new president who has witnessed firsthand over his career how innovation can help the nation grow and recover.After four years of Trump’s stubborn denialism, magic thinking and economic harm, Biden will promote policy rigor, public spiritedness and private sector ingenuity to work together for innovative solutions. It will be hard work and I promise you it won’t be pretty, but we should expect the dawn of a new era of U.S. tech-driven dynamism.""]",he assumed the newly created title of president,"['Joe Biden', 'NavigationClose', 'Getty ImagesJim MessinaContributorShare', 'Jim Messina', 'The Messina Group', 'the White House', 'Operations', 'Barack Obama', 'Obama', 'Obama-Biden', 'White House', 'Biden-Harris', 'Obama-Biden', 'Biden', 'Congress', 'California Assembly', 'Labor', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'the Department of Labor', 'Biden', 'the Department of Labor', 'Biden', 'the Department of Labor', 'Biden', 'Labor', 'Marty Walsh', 'Uber', 'Labor', 'Congress', 'Trump’s', 'Biden', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/mCVicnnde0,2021-01-20T18:41:39,"White House, dark mode: Biden admin refreshes presidency’s website, vows accessibility","['WhiteHouse.gov, the official website for all presidential actions and efforts, is among the first things to be changed up under the freshly inaugurated President Biden. A fashionable dark mode appeared, as well as a large text toggle for straining eyes, and the webmaster has committed to making the whole site conform to the latest accessibility guidelines.The look isn’t so very different from the previous administration’s site — they’re both fairly modern and minimal experiences, with big photos up front and tidy lists of priorities and announcements once you drill down into a category.Image Credits: White HouseBut one big design change implemented by the new administration that many will appreciate is the inclusion of a dark mode, or high contrast mode, and a large type toggle.Dark modes have been around forever, but became de rigeur when Apple implemented its own system-wide versions on iOS and macOS a while back. It’s just easier on the eyes in many ways, and at any rate it’s nice to give users options.The WhiteHouse.gov dark mode changes the headline type from a patriotic blue to an eye-friendly off-white, with links a calming Dijon. Even the White House logo itself goes from a dark blue background to full black with a white border. It’s all very tasteful, and if anything seems like a low-contrast mode, not high.The large type mode does what it says, making everything considerably bigger and easier to tap or click. The toggles, it must be said, are a bit over-prominent, but they’ll probably tweak that soon.There’s also a Spanish-language option, no doubt welcome by the millions of Americans whose first language that is. This was not present on the previous White House/Casa Blanca page.More forward-looking is the pledge in the accessibility section:This commitment to accessibility for all begins with this site and our efforts to ensure all functionality and all content is accessible to all Americans.Our ongoing accessibility effort works towards conforming to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1, level AA criteria.The WCAG guidelines are a set of best practices for designing a website so that its content can be easily accessed by people who use screen readers, need captions for audio or can’t use a mouse or touchscreen easily. The guidelines aren’t particularly hard to meet, but as many have pointed out, it’s harder to retrofit a website to be accessible than to design it for accessibility from the start. Government sites are required to be accessible, but have varying levels of conformity.One thing I noticed was that many of the photos on the White House website have alt text or visible captions attached — these help visually impaired visitors understand what’s in an image. Here’s an example:Image Credits: White House\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Normally that alt text would be read out by a screen reader when it got to the image, but it’s generally not made visible.Unless the metadata was stripped from the previous administration’s site (it’s archived here), none of the photos I checked had text descriptions there, so this is a big improvement. Unfortunately some photos (like the big header photo on the front page) don’t have descriptions, something that should probably be remedied.Fable aims to make disability-inclusive design as simple as a serviceAccessibility in other places will mean prompt inclusion of plaintext versions of governance items and announcements (versus PDFs or other documents), captions on official videos and other media, and as the team notes, lots of little improvements that make the site better for everyone who visits.It’s a small thing in a way, compared with the changes expected to accompany the new administration, but small things tend to pile up and become big things.As Microsoft’s Isaac Hepworth noted, there’s still lots of work to do, and that’s why U.S. Digital Services hid a little message in the source code:Image Credits: White HouseIf you’re interested in helping out, sign up here.Matt Cutts on solving big problems with lean solutions at the US Digital Service']",speech,"['White House', 'Biden', 'NavigationClose ScreenWhite House', 'Biden', 'White HouseWhiteHouse.gov', 'Biden', 'HouseBut', 'Apple', 'Dijon', 'the White House', 'White House', 'Casa Blanca', 'the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines', 'the White House', 'White House', 'Microsoft', 'Isaac Hepworth', 'U.S. Digital Services', 'White HouseIf', 'Matt Cutts', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'HouseWhite House', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/t7a176EUMI,2021-01-20T17:55:26,Monzo founder Tom Blomfield is departing the challenger bank and says he’s ‘struggled’ during the pandemic,"['Monzo founder Tom Blomfield is departing the U.K. challenger bank entirely at the end of the month, staff were informed earlier today.Blomfield held the role of CEO until May last year when he assumed the newly created title of president and resigned from the Monzo board. However, having been given the time and space to consider his long-term future at the bank he helped create six years ago, and with a refreshed executive team now in place, he says it is time to “hand over the baton”.In a brief but candid telephone interview, Blomfield also revealed that, as well as being unhappy during the last couple of years as CEO when the company scaled well beyond a “scrappy startup”, the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns exacerbated pressures placed on his own mental well-being. “I’m very happy to talk about what’s gone on with me, because I don’t think people do it enough”, he says.“I stopped enjoying my role probably about two years ago… as we grew from a scrappy startup that was iterating and building stuff people really love, into a really important U.K. bank. I’m not saying that one is better than the other, just that the things I enjoy in life is working with small groups of passionate people to start and grow stuff from scratch, and create something customers love. And I think that’s a really valuable skill but also taking on a bank that’s three, four, five million customers and turning it into a 10 or 20 million customer bank and getting to profitability and IPOing it, I think those are huge exciting challenges, just honestly not ones that I found that I was interested in or particularly good at”.In early 2019 after realising he was “doing too much and not enjoying it,” Blomfield began talking to Monzo investor Eileen Burbidge of Passion Capital, and Monzo Chair Gary Hoffman, about changing roles and how he needed more help. Then, he says, “COVID just exacerbated things,” a period when Monzo also had to cut staff, shutter its Las Vegas office and raise bridge funding in a highly publicised down round.Monzo confirms £60M down round, with a new pre-money valuation of £1.24B“I think [for] a lot of people in the world — and you and I have spoken about this — going through a pandemic, going through lockdown and the isolation involved in that has an impact on people’s mental health,” says Blomfield. “I don’t think I was any different, so I was really struggling. I had a really, really supportive exec team around me and a really supportive set of investors on board and I was really grateful that when I put my hand up and said, ‘I need help,’ they were super receptive to that”.Blomfield also comes clean about his role as president, a title that was intended as a way to provide the time and space for him to get well and figure out if he would return longer-term to Monzo or depart entirely. Contrary to rumours, Blomfield says he wasn’t pushed out by investors. Instead, the Monzo board actually put pressure on him to remain as CEO longer than he wanted or perhaps should have (a version of events corroborated by my own sources). “When I took that president role, it was not certain one way or another what would happen,” Blomfield says, apologising in case I felt I was misled when I reported the news.(The truth is, within weeks of running that news piece, I knew it was far from certain Blomfield would ever return, with multiple sources, including people close to and worried about Blomfield, confiding in me how burned out the Monzo founder was. As weeks turned into months and following additional sourcing, I had enough information to write a follow-up story much earlier but chose to wait until a formal decision was taken.)TechCrunch’s Steve O’Hear interviewing Monzo’s Tom Blomfield. Image Credits: Startup GrindMeanwhile, Blomfield describes his resignation as a Monzo employee as “bitter-sweet,” and is keen to praise what the Monzo team has already achieved, including since his much-reduced involvement. “I think the team has done phenomenally well over the last year or so in really difficult circumstances,” he says. In particular, he cites Monzo’s new CEO TS Anil as doing a “phenomenal” job, while describing Sujata Bhatia, who joined as COO last year, as “an absolute machine, a real operator”.Monzo recruits former Amex exec Sujata Bhatia as its new COOTo that end, Monzo now has almost 5 million customers, up from 1.3 million in 2019. Monzo’s total weekly revenue is now 30% higher than pre-pandemic, helped no doubt by over 100,000 paid subscribers across Monzo Plus and Premium in the last five months (sources tell me the company surpassed £2 million in weekly revenue in December for the first time in its history). Albeit at a lower valuation, the challenger bank also raised £125 million from new and existing investors during the pandemic.Blomfield also says that Anil and Bhatia and other members of the Monzo executive team have specific skills — that he simply doesn’t have — related to scaling and managing a bank approaching 5 million customers. And even if he did, he has learned the hard way that there are aspects of running a large company that not everyone enjoys.“Going from a CEO where you’re front and centre dealing with all of the different pressures every day to a much lighter role is a huge huge weight off my shoulders and has given me the time and space to recover”, he adds. “I’m now feeling pretty great. I’m enjoying life again”.As for what’s next for Blomfield, he says he wants to “chill out” for a bit and perhaps take a holiday. He’s also finishing his vaccination training so that he can volunteer to help deliver the U.K.’s national COVID-19 vaccination rollout. A recent tweet by Blomfield about a side project also led to speculation that he has begun a new venture. Not true, says Blomfield, telling me it was a five-day project designed to get back into coding and play with a robotic 2D printer. And while he’s very much left Monzo, he says he’ll continue cheering on the company from the outside.Monzo, the UK challenger bank, picks up additional £60M in funding']",from the company’s above-range IPO price of $42,"['Tom Blomfield', 'NavigationClose ScreenMonzo', 'Tom Blomfield', 'CommentMonzo', 'Tom Blomfield', 'Blomfield', 'Monzo', 'Blomfield', 'Blomfield', 'Monzo', 'Eileen Burbidge', 'Passion Capital', 'Monzo Chair', 'Gary Hoffman', 'Monzo', 'Blomfield', 'Blomfield', 'Monzo', 'Blomfield', 'Monzo', 'Blomfield', 'Blomfield', 'Blomfield', 'Monzo', 'Steve O’Hear', 'Monzo', 'Tom Blomfield', 'Blomfield', 'Monzo', 'Monzo', 'Monzo', 'Anil', 'Sujata Bhatia', 'COO', 'Amex', 'Sujata Bhatia', 'Monzo', 'Monzo', 'Monzo Plus', 'Blomfield', 'Anil', 'Bhatia', 'Monzo', 'COVID-19', 'Blomfield', 'Monzo', 'Monzo', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'BlomfieldMonzo', 'Tom Blomfield', 'Tom Blomfield', 'Blomfield', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Bhgik5sGLx,2021-01-20T17:17:44,EU chief warns over ‘unfiltered’ hate speech and calls for Biden to back rules for big tech,"['In a speech to the European Parliament today marking the inauguration of U.S. president Joe Biden, the president of the European Commission has called for Europe and the U.S. to join forces on regulating tech giants, warning of the risks of “unfiltered” hate speech and disinformation being weaponized to attack and undermine democracies.Ursula von der Leyen pointed to the shock storming of the U.S. capital earlier this month by supporters of outgoing president Donald Trump as an example of how wild claims being spread and amplified online can have tangible real-world consequences, including for democratic institutions.“Just a few days ago, several hundred [Trump supporters] stormed the Capitol in Washington, the heart of American democracy. The television images of that event shocked us all.\xa0That is what happens when words incite action,” she said. “That is what happens when hate speech and fake news spread like wildfire through digital media. They become a danger to democracy.”Europe seizes on social media’s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulationEuropean institutions are also being targeted with “hate and contempt for our democracy spreading unfiltered through social media to millions of people”, she warned, pointing to similarly disturbing attacks that have taken place in the region in recent years. Such as an attempt by right-wing extremists in Germany to storm the Reichstag building last summer and the 2016 murder of U.K. politician Jo Cox by a fascist extremist.“Of course, the storming of the [U.S.] Capitol was different. But in Europe, too, there are people who feel disadvantaged and are very angry,” she said, suggesting feelings of exclusion and injustice can make people vulnerable to believing the “rampant” conspiracy theories that platforms have allowed to circulate freely online, and which she characterized as “often a confused mixture of completely absurd fantasies”.“We must make sure that messages of hate and fake news can no longer be spread unchecked,” she added, reiterating the case for regulating social media by pressing the case for imposing “democratic limits on the untrammelled and uncontrolled political power of the internet giants”.The European Commission has already set out its blueprint for overhauling the region’s digital rulebook when it unveiled the draft Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act last month. Although it won’t be including hard legal limits on disinformation in the package — preferring to continue with a voluntary, but beefed up code of conduct for content that falls into a grey area where it may be harmful but isn’t actually illegal.Von der Leyen said the aim for the regulations is to ensure “if something is illegal offline it must also be illegal online”. The Commission has also said the tech policy package is about forcing platforms to take more responsibility for the content they spread and monetize.But it’s not yet clear how the proposed laws will ultimately tackle the tricky issue of how assessments are made to remove (or reinstate) speech; and whether platforms will continue to make those judgements (under a regulator’s guidance and watchful eye), or whether they end up entirely independent of platform control.What the Commission has suggested is closer to the former but the proposal has to go through the EU’s co-legislative process — so such details are likely to be debated and could be amended prior to adoption into law.Understanding Europe’s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook“We want the platforms to be transparent about how their algorithms work. We cannot accept a situation where decisions that have a wide-ranging impact on our democracy are being made by computer programs without any human supervision,” von der Leyen went on. “And we want it laid down clearly that internet companies take responsibility for the content they disseminate.”She also reiterated the concern expressed in recent days about the unilateral actions taken by tech giants to close down Trump’s megaphone — echoing comments by political leaders across Europe earlier this month who dubbed the display of raw platform power, from companies like Twitter, as “problematic”; and said it must result in regulatory consequences for tech giants.\xa0\xa0“No matter how right it may have been for Twitter to switch off Donald Trump’s account five minutes after midnight, such serious interference with freedom of expression should be based on laws and not on company rules,” she said, adding: “It should be based on decisions of politicians and parliaments and not of Silicon Valley managers.”In the speech, the EU president also expressed hope that the Biden administration will be inclined to arc toward Europe’s agenda on digital regulation — as part of the anticipated post-Trump reboot of EU-U.S. relations.The Commission recently adopted a new transatlantic agenda in which it laid out a number of policy areas it hopes for joint-working with the U.S. — with tech governance key among the areas of hoped for policy cooperation.Europe will push to work with the US on tech governance, post-TrumpVon der Leyen reiterated the idea that a joint Trade and Technology Council could be “a first step” toward the EU and US fashioning a “digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide”.“It is in this digital field that Europe has so much to offer the new government in Washington”, she suggested. “The path we have taken in Europe can be an example for approaches at international level. As has long been the case with the General Data Protection Regulation.“Together we could create a digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide: From data protection and privacy to the security of technical infrastructure. A body of rules based on our values: human rights and pluralism, inclusion and protection of privacy.”While there’s evidently a keen appetite in the EU to reset U.S. relations post-Trump, it remains to be seen how much of a policy reboot the Biden administration will usher in, vis-à-vis big tech.He has not been as vocal a critic of platform giants as other Democratic challengers for the presidency. And the Obama administration, which he of course served in, had very cosy ties to Silicon Valley.Concerns have also been raised in recent days about Biden’s potential picks for a key appointment at the justice office — in light of antitrust probes of big tech versus the prospective appointees’ deep links to tech giants and/or promotion of historical mergers. So it hardly looks like a model for a full and clean reset.While the tricky issue of pro-privacy reform of U.S. surveillance laws — which EU commissioners have warned will be needed to resolve the legal uncertainty clouding data transfers from the region to the U.S. (and which tech giants themselves have largely avoided in their own lobbying) — seems likely to need legislation from Congress, rather than being a change that could be driven solely by the Biden administration.The chances of the incoming president being inclined to champion such a relatively wonky tech-policy issue when he has so much else in his “needs urgent attention” in-tray also seem relatively slim. But even slender odds can look promising after the Trump era.\xa0\xa0Tech in the Biden era']",released recently,"['EU', 'Biden', 'NavigationClose', 'Biden', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Thierry Monasse/Corbis / Getty ImagesIn', 'the European Parliament', 'Joe Biden', 'the European Commission', 'Donald Trump', 'Jo Cox', 'Capitol', 'The European Commission', 'Digital', 'Digital Markets Act', 'Von der Leyen', 'Commission', 'rulebook“We', 'Trump’s', 'Donald Trump’s', 'EU', 'Biden', 'post-Trump', 'EU', 'Commission', 'Trade and Technology Council', 'EU', 'worldwide”', 'the General Data Protection Regulation', 'EU', 'Biden', 'Obama', 'Biden', 'EU', 'Congress', 'Biden', 'Trump', 'Biden', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Acteuplatform', 'Biden', 'the European Parliament', 'Joe Biden', 'the European Commission', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/IWeS8UJTmA,2021-01-20T16:16:18,Joe Biden’s new gig,"[""Jim MessinaContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tJim Messina is a political and corporate advisor and CEO of The Messina Group. He previously served as the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and as the campaign manager for Obama's successful 2012 reelection campaign.\tAfter serving as Obama-Biden campaign manager and White House deputy chief of staff and now living in San Francisco and working with the tech sector, I am hopeful about the Biden-Harris administration’s ability to put in place smart policies and regulatory stability to further unleash the industry’s vast potential — not to mention the effect their calm and measured leadership could have on our greater economy.However, with new leadership comes new perspectives on many of the most critical issues facing Silicon Valley. While the bonds between the innovation economy and the Obama-Biden administration resulted in national prosperity, the tech sector is now intertwined in nearly every facet of American life.The resulting tension means the new administration will take its role as regulator seriously and investors and businesses alike should not overlook how quickly President Biden will move on policy — especially as it relates to the future of work and getting the U.S. economy back on track.There’s no question the gig companies had a banner year in 2020. Even with ride-hailing usage down dramatically, the strength of meal, grocery and just about everything else delivered combined with the victory in California of Proposition 22 has driven up market caps and positioned many startups for going public. Yet, while the West Coast may be feeling emboldened, the Beltway has another trajectory in mind.Congress has been working on gig worker classification legislation named the PRO Act for months. The bill closely mirrors the maligned California Assembly Bill 5 that Proposition 22 mostly reversed. It’s broadly supported by labor and could see some traction this year. Labor is already working hard to line up support from the various congressional coalitions, and at the same time gig economy companies are gearing up to fight it with their unlimited resources.The question is — what will President Biden do? Long ago he voiced his support for AB 5 and laid out plans to solve worker misclassification during the campaign, but he’s also hiring and appointing staff to the administration deeply experienced in tech. President Biden has been governing longer than most startup founders have been alive, he’s a master at understanding forces in Washington and how to reach a compromise. He knows that what’s rarely discussed during legislative debate is how the law will actually be implemented. \n\t\t\tWe shouldn’t be surprised if the Biden administration convenes the Department of Labor and the industry to determine how companies actually enact worker protections.\t\t\t\t\tDespite most bills being thousands of pages, they’re rarely prescriptive. Those details are left up to agencies. President Biden has oversight of the Department of Labor, which, if the PRO Act is passed, will be responsible for its implementation.We shouldn’t be surprised if the Biden administration convenes the Department of Labor and the industry to determine how companies actually enact worker protections. President Biden’s nominee for Labor Secretary, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, while a staunch supporter of labor, is also well-regarded by the business sector as someone they can work with and reach a compromise.We just have to look to the states to understand why this outcome is so plausible. The gig companies already have Proposition 22-type campaigns underway in six states and are running legislation in a half dozen more. By the end of 2021 there will be law on the books codifying worker protections in nearly a third of the country, modeled on Proposition 22.This kind of momentum is hard to ignore and labor knows it. Although labor is aligned in its support of the PRO Act, the alignment becomes blurry when considering state action. For example, many northeastern states have had a thriving black car and taxi industry for decades.This means labor’s position on gig laws in New York and New Jersey are quite different than places like Washington state or Illinois where gig workers are still relatively new and the ink is drying on regulations supported by Uber and Lyft just a few years ago. Labor is aligned as much as they can be and enough to support the PRO Act, but there isn’t a national movement and that leaves room for compromise.This is all good news for the tech sector. It’s a fantasy to think that regulation wouldn’t eventually come to protect the very workers who power the gig economy. And that’s a good thing — tech has a moral responsibility to do right by its workers. However, those regulations shouldn’t and won’t be imposed on tech. Rather it will take weeks and months of campaigns and bills winding their way through the states and Congress, culminating with negotiations and compromises.Or maybe even years of renewed regulatory processes. All of which will be overseen by a new president who has witnessed firsthand over his career how innovation can help the nation grow and recover.After four years of Trump’s stubborn denialism, magic thinking and economic harm, Biden will promote policy rigor, public spiritedness and private sector ingenuity to work together for innovative solutions. It will be hard work and I promise you it won’t be pretty, but we should expect the dawn of a new era of U.S. tech-driven dynamism.""]", MIT have developed a new method for growing plant tissues in a lab,"['Joe Biden', 'NavigationClose', 'Getty ImagesJim MessinaContributorShare', 'Jim Messina', 'The Messina Group', 'the White House', 'Operations', 'Barack Obama', 'Obama', 'Obama-Biden', 'White House', 'Biden-Harris', 'Obama-Biden', 'Biden', 'Congress', 'California Assembly', 'Labor', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'the Department of Labor', 'Biden', 'the Department of Labor', 'Biden', 'the Department of Labor', 'Biden', 'Labor', 'Marty Walsh', 'Uber', 'Labor', 'Congress', 'Trump’s', 'Biden', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Biden', 'Biden', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.But a peek at aggregate results for the world’s largest VC market provides only part of the picture. We need to narrow our lens and peer more deeply into standout categories to understand how the U.S. venture capital market managed to post its biggest year ever in terms of dollars invested, despite seeing deal volume slip for a second consecutive year.This morning, we’re scraping data together to better understand.First, we want to see how unicorns performed in Q4 2020. This column noted in late December that it felt like unicorn creation was rapid in the quarter; how did that hold up?Then we’ll dig into PitchBook data concerning the fintech sector, a huge recipient of venture capital time, attention and money.Fintech’s 2020 is a good perspective to view both the year and its wild final quarter. So this morning, as America itself resets, let’s take a moment to understand last year just a little bit better as we get into this new one.UnicornsOne of the most curious things about the unicorn era is the rising bet it represents.

But, quarter after quarter, the number of unexited unicorns rises.

https://t.co/na1VXuTJ1O,2021-01-20T14:54:01,MIT develops method for lab-grown plants that eventually lead to alternatives to forestry and farming,"['Researchers at MIT have developed a new method for growing plant tissues in a lab — sort of like how companies and researchers are approaching lab-grown meat. The process would be able to produce wood and fibre in a lab environment, and researchers have already demonstrated how it works in concept by growing simple structures using cells harvested from zinnia leaves.This work is still in its very early stages, but the potential applications of lab-grown plant material are significant, and include possibilities in both agriculture and in construction materials. While traditional agricultural is much less ecologically damaging when compared to animal farming, it can still have a significant impact and cost, and it takes a lot of resources to maintain. Not to mention that even small environmental changes can have a significant effect on crop yield.Forestry, meanwhile, has much more obvious negative environmental impacts. If the work of these researchers can eventually be used to create a way to produce lab-grown wood for use in construction and fabrication in a way that’s scalable and efficient, then there’s tremendous potential in terms of reducing the impact on forestry globally. Eventually, the team even theorizes you could coax the growth of plant-based materials into specific target shapes, so you could also do some of the manufacturing in the lab, by growing a wood table directly for instance.There’s still a long way to go from what the researchers have achieved. They’ve only grown materials on a very small scale, and will look to figure out ways to grow plant-based materials with different final properties as one challenge. They’ll also need to overcome significant barriers when it comes to scaling efficiencies, but they are working on solutions that could address some of these difficulties.Lab-grown meat is still in its infancy, and lab-grown plant material is even more nascent.

According to Chief Marketing Officer Conrad Lisco, this acquisition allows the company to offer the industry’s “first end-to-end marketing solution,” combining consumer data, digital advertising, regulatory compliance (thanks to Fyllo’s acquisition of CannaRegs last year) and, through DataOwl, CRM and loyalty tied into a business’ point-of-sale system.As an example, founder and CEO Chad Bronstein (previously the chief revenue officer at digital marketing company Amobee) said that retailers will be able to use the Fyllo platform to send promotional texts to regular customers while, crucially, ensuring those campaigns are fully in compliance with state and local regulations. He added that eventually, the platform could be used beyond cannabis, in other regulated industries.“Beauty, gambling, etc. — the same things need to happen in every regulated industry, they would all benefit from loyalty and compliance automation,” Bronstein said.In addition, he argued that mainstream brands are increasingly interested in using data around cannabis and CBD consumers, as borne out in a Forrester study commissioned by Fyllo.Cannabis marketing company Fyllo acquires CannaRegs for $10MLisco said this acquisition comes at a crucial time for the cannabis industry, with dispensaries classified as essential businesses in many states, as well as continuing momentum behind marijuana legalization.“In 2020, cannabis came of age,” he said. “We would say it went from illicit to essential in 10 months … 2021 is really about watching endemic [marijuana] brands try to scale, so that they can capitalize on the explosive growth. They’ve historically been excluded from the kinds of integrated marketing capabilities that other non-endemic [mainstream] brands get to use when they go to market.”Bronstein said Fyllo aims to bring those capabilities to marijuana brands, first by bringing its compliance capabilities into the DataOwl product. The company also aims to create a national cannabis loyalty platform, allowing a marijuana retailer in one state to easily expand its marketing capabilities into other states in a compliant fashion.The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. DataOwl co-founders Dan Hirsch and Vartan Arabyan are joining Fyllo, as is the rest of their team, bringing the company’s total headcount to 110.“By integrating with Fyllo, DataOwl’s solutions will reach the widest possible audience via the industry’s most innovative marketing platform,” Hirsch said in a statement.2020 was a defining year for cannabis: What comes next?']",recovered its first booster last year,"['Fyllo', 'NavigationClose ScreenCannabis', 'Fyllo', 'DataOwl', 'Fyllo', 'Conrad Lisco', 'Fyllo’s', 'CannaRegs', 'DataOwl', 'Chad Bronstein', 'Amobee', 'Fyllo', 'Bronstein', 'CBD', 'Forrester', 'Fyllo', 'Fyllo', 'CannaRegs', 'Fyllo', 'DataOwl', 'Dan Hirsch', 'Vartan Arabyan', 'Fyllo', 'Fyllo', 'DataOwl', 'Hirsch', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'TechFundings & ExitsM&AStartupscannabisCannaRegsDataOwldigital', 'AcquisitionsCannabis', 'Fyllo', 'DataOwl', 'Fyllo', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

This puts the total Starlink constellation size at almost 1,000, as the company has expanded its beta access program for the service to the U.K. and Canada, with a first deployment in the latter country serving a rural First Nations community in a remote part of the province of Ontario.The launch took off from Florida at 8:02 AM EST (5:02 AM PST), with delivery of the satellites following as planned at around an hour after lift-off. The booster on this launch flew seven times previously, as mentioned — including just in December when it was used to deliver a SiriusXM satellite to orbit to support that company’s satellite radio network.Today’s launch was also notable because it included a landing attempt in so-called “envelope expansion” conditions, which means that the winds in the landing zone where SpaceX’s drone recovery ship was stationed at sea actually exceeded the company’s previously defined safety window for making a landing attempt.As a result of today’s success, SpaceX will likely now have higher tolerances for wind speeds in order to attempt recovery, which should translate to fewer cancellations of launches based on weather conditions in the landing zone.Watch SpaceX launch a SiriusXM broadcasting satellite live during its 25th flight of 2020']",HiPeople,"['Falcon', 'NavigationClose', 'Falcon', 'Etherington@etherington', 'SpaceXSpaceX', 'Falcon', 'First Nations', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'MuskFalcon', 'Falcon', 'Falcon', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/VTuQw9ewSL,2021-01-20T13:08:46,Valve and five PC games publishers fined $9.4M for illegal geo-blocking,"['A lengthy antitrust investigation into PC games geo-blocking in the European Union by distribution platform Valve and five games publishers has led to fines totalling €7.8 million (~$9.4 million) after the Commission confirmed today that the bloc’s rules had been breached.The geo-blocking practices investigated since before 2017 concerned around 100 PC video games of different genres, including sports, simulation and action games.In addition to Valve — which has been fined just over €1.6 million — the five sanctioned games publishers are: Bandai Namco (fined €340,000), Capcom (€396,000), Focus Home (€2.8 million), Koch Media (€977,000) and ZeniMax (€1.6 million).The Commission said the fines were reduced by between 10% and 15% owing to cooperation from the companies, with the exception of Valve, which it said chose not to cooperate (a “prohibition Decision” rather than a fine reduction was applied in its case).Valve has been contacted for comment. Update: A company spokesman said: “During the seven year investigation Valve has cooperated fully, providing all requested evidence and information to the Commission. We disagree with these findings, and plan to appeal the decision.”An in-depth antitrust investigation was announced publicly by the Commission in February 2017, with a formal statement of objections issued just over two years later — when it accused the companies of “entering into bilateral agreements to prevent consumers from purchasing and using PC video games acquired elsewhere than in their country of residence” in contravention of EU rules.EU goes after Valve for ‘geo-blocking’ Steam activation codesThe mechanisms used by the companies to prevent certain cross-border sales of certain PC games were geo-blocked Steam activation keys and bilateral licensing and distribution agreements to restrict certain cross-border sales.EU lawmakers has now found that these business practices partitioned certain European markets according to national borders — denying regional consumers the benefits of the EU’s Digital Single Market to shop around for the best offer.Commenting in a statement, EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up competition policy for the bloc, said: “Today’s sanctions against the ‘geo-blocking’ practices of Valve and five PC video game publishers serve as a reminder that under EU competition law, companies are prohibited from contractually restricting cross-border sales. Such practices deprive European consumers of the benefits of the EU Digital Single Market and of the opportunity to shop around for the most suitable offer in the EU.”According to the Commission’s investigation, geo-blocking of Steam activation keys prevented activation of certain of the five games’ publishers titles outside of Czechia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.It said agreements between the companies to geo-block activation keys had lasted between one and five years and were found to have been implemented at various times between September 2010 and October 2015.While four of the games publishers (not Capcom) were found to have entered into licensing and distribution agreements with various PC games distributors (not Valve) in the European Economic Area (EEA) which contained clauses which restricted cross-border sales of the affected titles within the EEA, including the aforementioned Central and Eastern European countries.The Commission said these agreements lasted generally longer (“between three and 11 years”), and were implemented at different times between March 2007 and November 2018.Since the investigation started, EU lawmakers have passed a regulation against unjustified geo-blocking. Although the legislation only applies to PC video games distributed on CDs or DVDs, not to downloads. So games are only partially covered.A Commission review of how the geo-blocking regulation is operating, published last November, discussed a possible extension of its scope in a range of areas, including for games. However it did not make a strong case for that change. (It also found demand for cross-border access to games, and software generally, relatively low versus other content services.)But while games distributed via digital downloads look set to remain outside the scope of the EU’s unjustified geo-blocking regulation, the fines against Valve et al. show that geo-blocking can still be a legal minefield as contractual agreements to restrict cross-border sales run counter to the bloc’s antitrust rules.The specific breaches are of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area which prohibit agreements between companies that prevent, restrict or distort competition within the EU’s Single Market, per the Commission.Update 2:\xa0Valve has now sent additional details of its disagreement with the Commission’s findings, and denied that it did not cooperate with the investigation. It also warned the elimination of region locks could result in games publishers raising prices in some “less affluent” regions to avoid price arbitrage.Its spokesman told us:During the seven year investigation, Valve cooperated extensively with the European Commission (“EC”), providing evidence and information as requested. \xa0However, Valve declined to admit that it broke the law, as the EC demanded. \xa0Valve disagrees with the EC findings and the fine levied against Valve.The EC’s charges do not relate to the sale of PC games on Steam – Valve’s PC gaming service. Instead\xa0the EC alleges that Valve enabled geo-blocking by providing Steam activation keys and – upon the publishers’ request – locking those keys to particular territories (“region locks”) within the EEA.\xa0 Such keys allow a customer to activate and play a game on Steam when the user has purchased it from a third-party reseller. Valve provides Steam activation keys free of charge and does not receive any share of the purchase price when a game is sold by third-party resellers (such as a retailer or other online store).The region locks only applied to a small number of game titles. \xa0Approximately just 3% of all games using Steam (and none of Valve’s own games) at the time were subject to the contested region locks in the EEA.Valve believes that the EC’s extension of liability to a platform provider in these circumstances is not supported by applicable law. Nonetheless, because of the EC’s concerns, Valve actually turned off region locks within the EEA starting in 2015, unless those region locks were necessary for local legal requirements (such as German content laws) or geographic limits on where the Steam partner is licensed to distribute a game. \xa0The elimination of region locks may also cause publishers to raise prices in less affluent regions to avoid price arbitrage. There are no costs involved in sending activation keys from one country to another, and the activation key is all a user needs to activate and play a PC game.EU lawmakers to push audio-visual sector on geoblockingThis report was updated with comment from Valve. We also made a correction after initially stating that the EU’s investigation had taken four years, starting in 2017. That was the date the Commission announced it was launching an in-depth investigation. But, per Valve, the probe took longer — spanning seven years.']",Landbot,"['NavigationClose', 'Lomas@riptari /', 'Flickr', 'the European Union', 'Commission', 'Bandai Namco', 'Capcom', 'Focus Home', 'Koch Media', 'ZeniMax', 'Commission', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'Digital Single Market', 'EU', 'the EU Digital Single Market', 'Capcom', 'the European Economic Area', 'EEA', 'The Commission', 'EU', 'EU', 'Single Market', 'Commission', 'Commission’s', 'the European Commission', 'EC', 'Valve', 'EC', 'EC', 'EC', 'EC', 'EEA', 'Valve’s', 'EC', 'EC', 'EEA', 'EU', 'Commission', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'the European Union', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

It follows a $1.1 million pre-seed in late 2019. Notably, the seed round was closed fully remote, without any in-person meetings. “Just like the hiring processes of HiPeople’s clients,” founders Jakob Gillmann and Sebastian Schüller told me in an email.HiPeople says the investment will be used to support growth so that more recruiters can hire remotely using automated reference checks. Longer term, the company is developing a candidate analytics platform to provide rich data and insights on each candidate and enable what it frames as “data-driven” hiring.“Abstractly-speaking HiPeople is in the talent insights business,” say Gillmann and Schüller. “Its mission is to enable better hiring by automatically collecting and analyzing talent data, and providing rich insights. HiPeople currently solves this by automating candidate reference checks from request, to collection, and analysis. This allows companies to extend the information they have on a candidate without additional manual work”.The idea behind the software-as-a-service is that HiPeople’s approach creates a seamless user experience for the recruiter, and “verified, in-depth reference checks they can trust”. As a result, the startup claims that its users on average collect 2x the amount of references on a candidate, in 50% of the time. “Traditionally, reference checks are underutilized due to the highly manual process, and often only exclusively used for executive hiring. HiPeople dusts off reference checks, and enables rich talent insights by rethinking how they are done,” says HiPeople’s founders.HiPeople’s customers span fast-growing startups to tech scale-ups and more established upper mid-market companies. For example, process mining company Celonis, which doubled its workforce in the last 12 months to 1,200 employees globally, uses HiPeople to improve hiring quality for roles in San Francisco, Munich and Tokyo. “By programmatically conducting reference checks the company hires talent based on verified insights on topics like areas of improvement, skills, teamwork style, or work values,” explains HiPeople.Adds Moonfire’s Mattias Ljungman: “Workflow automation of repetitive processes, and insights on the candidate that go beyond the limitations of the CV, are a clear pain for anybody in recruiting. The Covid-influenced reality of remote work, hence remote hiring practices, has increased the complexity of finding the right talent. HiPeople created a way to enable anybody who is hiring to make better decisions, whilst improving processes and increasing hiring velocity”.Gillmann and Schüller tell me that in Europe, HiPeople mainly competes with the existing infrastructure and processes recruiters use to manually conduct references checks. In the U.S., companies like Xref or Crosschq are more direct competitors in terms of automating reference checks.Atomico co-founder and partner Mattias Ljungman is leaving to start his own seed fund']",who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison,"['NavigationClose', 'Mattias Ljungman’s', 'Capnamic Ventures', 'Cherry Ventures', 'HiPeople’s', 'Jakob Gillmann', 'Sebastian Schüller', 'Gillmann', 'Schüller', 'Mattias Ljungman', 'CV', 'velocity”', 'Schüller', 'Xref', 'Mattias Ljungman', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropeFundings &', 'Mattias Ljungman’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Previous investors Nauta Capital, Encomenda and Bankinter also participated in the round.We last chatted to Landbot back in 2018 when it raised a $2.2 million seed and had 900+ customers. It’s grown that to ~2,200 paying customers, with some 50,000 individuals now using its tool (across both free and paid accounts).Since its seed it’s also increased recurrent revenues 10x — and is expecting growth to keep stepping up, fuelled by the new financing.Landbot gets $2.2M for its on-message ‘anti-AI’ chatbotIt says the coronavirus pandemic has supercharged demand for conversational landing pages as all sorts of businesses look for ways to automate higher volumes of digitally inbound customer comms, without needing to make major investments in in-house IT.Landbot’s customers range from SMEs to specific teams and products within larger organisations, with the startup name-checking the likes of Nestlé, MediaMarkt, Coca-Cola, Cepsa, PcComponentes and Prudential among its customer roster.“We are seeing strong traction from industries like eCommerce, Financial Services and Marketing Agencies,” CEO & co-founder Jiaqi Pan tells TechCrunch. “The ecommerce segment is one we have seen the most growth in since COVID-19, where we increased 2x the number of customers from ecommerce industry.”The new funding will be used to double Landbot’s team during 2021 (currently it employs 40 people) —\xa0with hiring planned across sales, marketing and engineering.The startup, which launched its “no code” flavor of chatbot builder back in 2017, previously relocated HQ from Valencia to Barcelona to help with recruitment.Since Landbot’s launch, the burgeoning “no code/low code” movement has become a fully fledged trend driven by demand for productivity — and lead-boosting digital services outstripping most businesses’ supply of expert in-house techies able to build stuff.Hence the rise of service-builder tools that make customizable tech capabilities accessible to non-technical staff.The pandemic has merely poured more fuel on this fire — and low-friction tools like Landbot are clearly reaping the rewards.‘No code’ will define the next generation of softwareInterestingly, as well as competing with other conversational chatbot builders, like San Francisco-based ManyChat, Landbot says it’s seeing traction from customers who are seeking to replace web forms with more engaging chat interfaces.Its drag-and-drop chatbot builder tool supports information workers to design what Landbot bills as “an immersive web page experience filled with gifs and visual elements to capture the attention of the end-user” — so you can understand the appeal for SMEs to be able to replace their boring old static forms with an experience any smartphone user is familiar with from using messaging apps like WhatsApp.“In terms of the main competitor in the no-code space, we have some overlap with ManyChat as the most direct competitor for Chatbot. On the other hand, as we have a lot of customers using us to replace their forms we are competing also against form builders like Typeform,” says Pan, the latter another Barcelona-based startup which similarly bills itself as a platform for “conversational” and “interactive” data collection.Landbot notes it recently acquired India-based Morph.AI, a chat-based marketing automation tool, which it’s using to help convert social, website and ad traffic into leads — also with the aim of further expanding into presence in the Asian market.To date, 90% of its customers are international, with 60% coming from the U.S., U.K. and Germany.Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Juan Revuelta, general partner of Swanlaab, said: “The beauty of Landbot is in the drag and drop solution of the product. The simplicity is critical to making this product accessible to everyone across many different types of business. If you’re a small company you don’t have the luxury of time or money to solve issues in customer service or run lavish marketing campaigns.“Landbot helps all businesses to have truly frictionless conversations with customers and exchange the data they need to make smarter decisions and scale.

Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce platform, also came under scrutiny as market regulators opened an investigation into its alleged monopolistic practices.Some argue that the recent clampdown on Jack Ma’s internet empire signals Beijing’s growing unease with the country’s super-rich and private-sector power brokers.China postpones Ant’s colossal IPO after closed-door talk with Jack Ma“Today, Alibaba and its archrival, Tencent, control more personal data and are more intimately involved in everyday life in China than Google, Facebook and other American tech titans are in the United States. And just like their American counterparts, the Chinese giants sometimes bully smaller competitors and kill innovation,” wrote Li Yuan for The New York Times.“You don’t have to be a member of the Communist Party to see reasons to rein them in.”In the 50-second clip, Ma is seen talking directly into the camera against what appears to be decorative paintings depicting a water town typical of Zhejiang. An art history book is shown amid a stack of books, alongside a vase of fresh flowers and a ceramic figurine of a stout, reclining man who looks relaxed and content.Ma addressed the 100 teachers receiving the Jack Ma Rural Teachers Award, which was set up by the Jack Ma Foundation to identify outstanding rural teachers every year. It’s unclear from where Ma was speaking, but the video briefly shows him visiting a rural boarding school in Zhejiang on January 10. The award ceremony was moved online this year due to the pandemic, Ma told the award recipients.When Ma announced his retirement plan, he pledged to return to his teaching roots and devote more time to education philanthropy, though the founder still holds considerable sway over Alibaba by keeping a seat in the powerful Alibaba Partnership. The legendary billionaire began his career as an English teacher in Hangzhou, and on Weibo, China’s Twitter equivalent, he nicknames himself the “ambassador for rural teachers.”Jack Ma officially retires as Alibaba’s chairman']",announced,"['Jack Ma’s', 'NavigationClose', 'Jack Ma’s', 'Jack Ma / Source', 'window)Alibaba', 'Ma’s', 'Ant Group', 'Jack Ma’s', 'Ant’s', 'Ant', 'Jack Ma’s', 'Ant’s', 'Jack', 'Alibaba', 'Li Yuan', 'The New York Times', 'the Communist Party', 'Ma', 'the Jack Ma Foundation', 'Ma', 'Ma', 'Ma', 'Alibaba Partnership', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Jack Ma’s', 'Liao9:13 AM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/ncD48yT6nK,2021-01-20T07:20:29,Former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski among list of last-minute Trump pardons,"['Anthony Levandowski, the former Google engineer and serial entrepreneur who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison on one count of stealing trade secrets, has received a pardon from President Donald Trump.The full pardon, which was one of 73 issued late Tuesday evening, means Levandowski will avoid a prison cell. The president also commuted 70 sentences. Levandowski received his sentence in August 2020. However, Judge Alsup, who presided over the case, said he didn’t need to report to prison until the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic had passed.“My family and I are grateful for the opportunity to move forward, and thankful to the President and others who supported and advocated on my behalf,” Levandowski told TechCrunch.Anthony Levandowski sentenced to 18 months in prison as new $4B lawsuit against Uber is filedLevandowski’s pardon was supported by technology founders and investors, including Founders Fund’s co-founder Peter Thiel and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey; trial lawyers Miles Ehrlich and Amy Craig; and businessman and investor Michael Ovitz. Other people connected to Thiel organizations also supported Levandowski, including Trae Stephens, partner at Founders Fund and Blake Masters, who is COO at Thiel Capital and president of The Thiel Foundation.Here is the full description, which includes people who supported the pardon, that was posted by the White House:Anthony Levandowski — President Trump granted a full pardon to Anthony Levandowski. This pardon is strongly supported by James Ramsey, Peter Thiel, Miles Ehrlich, Amy Craig, Michael Ovitz, Palmer Luckey, Ryan Petersen, Ken Goldberg, Mike Jensen, Nate Schimmel, Trae Stephens, Blake Masters, and James Proud, among others. Mr. Levandowski is an American entrepreneur who led Google’s efforts to create self-driving technology. Mr. Levandowski pled guilty to a single criminal count arising from civil litigation. Notably, his sentencing judge called him a “brilliant, groundbreaking engineer that our country needs.” Mr. Levandowski has paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good.Levandowski has been a polarizing figure in the autonomous vehicle industry. He is by all accounts — even among some of his harshest critics — a brilliant engineer. His bravado and risk-taking, combined with a likable, even affable personality, won him followers and rivals.He has been vilified as a thieving tech bro, unceremoniously ejected from Uber, and forced into bankruptcy by a $179 million award against him. He has also been heralded as a star engineer who was an early pioneer of autonomous vehicles. Levandowski was one of the founding members in 2009 of the Google self-driving project, which was internally called Project Chauffeur. He was rewarded handsomely\xa0 — about $127 million by Google — for his work on Project Chauffeur, according to the court documents.The criminal case that led to Levandowski’s sentencing in August is part of a multi-year legal saga that has entangled Levandowksi, Uber and Waymo, the former Google self-driving project that is now a business under Alphabet.In 2016, Levandowski left Google and started Otto with three other Google veterans:\xa0Lior Ron, Claire Delaunay and Don Burnette. Uber acquired Otto less than eight months later. Two months after the acquisition, Google made two arbitration demands against Levandowski and Ron. Uber wasn’t a party to either arbitration. However, under the indemnification agreement between Uber and Levandowski, the company was compelled to defend him.While the arbitrations played out, Waymo separately filed a lawsuit against Uber in February 2017 for trade secret theft and patent infringement. Waymo alleged in the suit, which went to trial but ended in a settlement in 2018, that Levandowski stole trade secrets, which were then used by Uber.Under the settlement, Uber agreed to not incorporate Waymo’s confidential information into their hardware and software. Uber also agreed to pay a financial settlement that included 0.34% of Uber equity, per its Series G-1 round $72 billion valuation. That calculated at the time to about $244.8 million in Uber equity.While Levandowski wasn’t a defendant in the Waymo v Uber suit, he would soon face a bigger obstacle.In August 2019, the U.S. District Attorney charged Levandowski alone with 33 counts of theft and attempted theft of trade secrets while working at Google.\xa0Levandowski and the U.S. District Attorney\xa0reached a plea deal in March 2020. Under that agreement, Levandowski admitted to downloading thousands of files related to Project Chauffeur. Specifically, he pleaded guilty to count 33 of the indictment, which is related to taking what was known as the Chauffeur Weekly Update, a spreadsheet that contained a variety of details including quarterly goals and weekly metrics as well as summaries of 15 technical challenges faced by the program and notes related to previous challenges that had been overcome.Anthony Levandowski pleads guilty to one count of trade secrets theft under plea dealThe U.S. District Attorney’s office had recommended a 27-month sentence. Levandowski had sought a fine, 12 months home confinement and 200 hours of community service. Alsup ultimately determined that home confinement would “[give] a green light to every future brilliant engineer to steal trade secrets. Prison time is the answer to that.”Instead, Alsup sentenced Lewandowski to 18 months, but delayed his prison time until the pandemic was under control.\xa0Levandowski also agreed to pay $756,499.22 in restitution to Waymo and a fine of $95,000.']",GSMA cancels Mobile World Congress due to coronavirus concerns,"['Google', 'Anthony Levandowski', 'NavigationClose', 'Anthony Levandowski', 'Justin Sullivan / Getty ImagesAnthony Levandowski', 'Google', 'Donald Trump', 'Levandowski', 'Levandowski', 'Alsup', 'Levandowski', 'Anthony Levandowski', 'Uber', 'Founders Fund’s', 'Peter Thiel', 'Oculus', 'Palmer Luckey', 'Miles Ehrlich', 'Amy Craig', 'Michael Ovitz', 'Levandowski', 'Trae Stephens', 'Founders Fund', 'Blake Masters', 'COO', 'Thiel Capital', 'The Thiel Foundation', 'the White House', 'Anthony Levandowski', 'Trump', 'Anthony Levandowski', 'James Ramsey', 'Peter Thiel', 'Miles Ehrlich', 'Amy Craig', 'Michael Ovitz', 'Palmer Luckey', 'Ryan Petersen', 'Ken Goldberg', 'Mike Jensen', 'Nate Schimmel', 'Trae Stephens', 'Blake Masters', 'James Proud', 'Levandowski', 'Google’s', 'Levandowski', 'Levandowski', 'Levandowski', 'Levandowski', 'Levandowski’s', 'Levandowksi, Uber', 'Google', 'Levandowski', 'Otto', 'Ron', 'Claire Delaunay', 'Don Burnette', 'Otto', 'Google', 'Levandowski', 'Ron', 'Uber', 'Levandowski', 'Uber', 'Levandowski', 'Levandowski', 'Levandowski', 'Chauffeur Weekly Update', 'Anthony Levandowski', 'Levandowski', 'Alsup', 'Alsup', 'Lewandowski', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LevandowskiGooglewaymoFormer Google', 'Anthony Levandowski', 'Korosec8:20 AM', '2021Anthony Levandowski', 'Google', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/dv5Gf6sXmu,2021-01-20T01:51:46,"Wattpad, the storytelling platform, is selling to South Korea’s Naver for $600 million","['Wattpad, the 14-year-old, Toronto-based, venture-backed storytelling platform with reach into a number of verticals, is being acquired by Naver, the South Korean conglomerate, in a $600 million cash-and-stock deal.Naver plans to incorporate at least part of the business into another of its holdings, the publishing platform Webtoon, which Naver launched in 2004, brought to the U.S. in 2014, and that features thousands of comic strips created by its users. It also has a huge audience. According to Naver, Webtoon was averaging more than 67 million monthly users as of last August.On its face, the deal appears to make sense. According to Korea’s Pulse News, some of the region’s webtoons are finding a broader geographic audience and crossing over into film. (Below is a trailer for one popular series called “The Secret of Angel.”)Similarly, Wattpad, which originally launched as an e-reading app, has evolved into a highly popular platform where users publish their original work and more than 90 million people visit monthly to read them. (Indeed, according to a story published last week in The Verge, Wattpad has published more than a billion stories over the years,\xa0 and it claims its users spend a collective 22 billion minutes per month reading these.)Like Webtoon, Wattpad has been more focused on streaming media, given the many platforms now needing fresh content, from Netflix to Apple to farther-flung outfits, like GoJek’s GoPlay, launched by the Indonesian ride-hailing giant in 2019. (In addition to Wattpad Studios, Wattpad also launched a book publishing division in 2019.)Storytelling app Wattpad raises $51M at a $398M valuationCEO Jun Koo Kim of Webtoon said in a press release about the new tie-up that it represents a “big step towards us becoming a leading global multimedia entertainment company.”Meanwhile, CEO Seong-Sook Han of Naver — a search engine giant whose properties include the popular Tokyo-based messaging app Line — said in a separate release that Wattpad co-founders Allen Lau and Ivan Yuen will continue post-acquisition to lead the company they have built.As for whether the acquisition is a win for Wattpad’s investors, it appears to be a moderate one. (It’s hard to discern much without knowing the terms under which each outfit invested.)Wattpaid had raised $117.8 million from investors in Asia, the United States and Canada over the years and closed its most recent round with $51 million from Tencent Holdings, BDC, Globe Telecom’s Kickstart Ventures, Peterson Group, Canso and Raine Ventures.That last deal, announced in 2018, assigned the company a post-money valuation of $398 million according to PitchBook.']",told the investigating magistrate,"['Wattpad', 'millionConnie Loizos@cookie /', 'WattpadWattpad', 'Naver', 'Korea’s Pulse News', 'Wattpad', 'Verge', 'Wattpad', 'Wattpad', 'Apple', 'GoJek', 'Wattpad Studios', 'Wattpad', 'Wattpad', 'Jun Koo Kim', 'Seong-Sook', 'Wattpad', 'Allen Lau', 'Ivan Yuen', 'Wattpad’s', 'Tencent Holdings', 'BDC', 'Globe Telecom’s', 'Kickstart Ventures', 'Peterson Group', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEntertainmentM&ATCNaverwattpadWattpad', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/omDOURg8ha,2021-01-19T23:47:42,Brave web browser adds native support for peer-to-peer IPFS protocol,"['The decentralized tech community is aiming to find support for technologies that go beyond cryptocurrency support.In a blog post today the team at Brave announced that they have worked with Protocol Labs to integrate native support for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) inside their browser. The peer-to-peer file-sharing standard launched in 2015 and has been gathering support among open-source advocates who laud the protocol’s ability to stop companies and government bodies from taking down content across the web, as well as the more functional performance improvements, offline file-viewing capabilities and underlying reliability.IPFS shares plenty of similarities with BitTorrent and allows files to be hosted by a multitude of users distributed across networks. With the update, Brave users will be able to access content from web addresses starting with ipfs:// and will be able to host an IPFS node themselves. The company says that adding support for IPFS will help improve “the overall resilience of the Internet.”Why The Internet Needs IPFS Before It’s Too LateBrave is a likely home for the IPFS protocol given the company’s affinity for all things decentralized. The startup founded by Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich says it now has 24 million monthly active users. Some of Brave’s most unique features have involved blockchain or peer-to-peer tech. In 2018, Brave announced a beta of Tor Tabs bringing the decentralized Onion protocol into the mix.Last year, Opera announced that it was bringing limited support for IPFS to its Android application.Decentralization tech is finding more mainstream interest as tech companies have slowly warmed up to the opportunities in cryptocurrency. Last week, TechCrunch looked into how Twitter was looking to help build out a decentralized network for social media platforms.Twitter’s decentralized futureIt’s unclear whether this is a technology that more mainstream browsers will opt to support natively, given the clear potential for abuse that exists in allowing users to work around file takedowns and the fact that it is a pretty niche technology for the time being.']",raised $2 billion in new funding,"['IPFS', 'NavigationClose', 'IPFS', 'CommentThe', 'Brave', 'Protocol Labs', 'the InterPlanetary File System', 'IPFS', 'IPFS', 'BitTorrent', 'IPFS', 'IPFS', 'IPFS', 'Mozilla', 'Brendan Eich', 'Brave', 'Opera', 'IPFS', 'Android', 'Twitter', 'Twitter’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'EichWeb', 'IPFS', 'Brave', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/UBT0MtU3mv,2021-01-20T00:54:05,Reflections on the first all-virtual CES,"['I’ve spent more time than I care to mention over the last several years wondering aloud about the value of in-person trade shows. There’s something seemingly antiquated in the idea of jamming a bunch of people in a room, walking from booth to booth. Sure, they’ve fulfilled an important need in the past, but aren’t they just a relic in this hyperconnected world?I’ve always assumed that if trade shows were to go extinct, it would be a gradual process — a slow fade into cultural irrelevance, like bookstores and record stores (both things I miss dearly). Technology has, for many intents and purposes, dramatically reduced their relative value to our society.While it’s undoubtedly true that Spotify and the Kindle Store are lacking in much of the appeal and all of the charm of their real-world counterparts, we’re happy to sacrifice all that and more at the alter of convenience.A rampaging pandemic has effectively given us a year without in-person trade shows. That means, among other things, we’ve had a much more immediate control variable in this question about trade shows. Last year’s CES managed to get in just under the wire. The next major consumer electronics show — Mobile World Congress — was eventually canceled after much hand-wringing.GSMA cancels Mobile World Congress due to coronavirus concernsThe CTA (the governing body behind CES) appeared to have been planning a scaled-back in-person version of the show this year, following a similar move by the team behind the Berlin-based IFA over the summer. By July, however, it was clear that such a plan was untenable. To put it bluntly, the United States didn’t have its shit together when it comes to keeping this virus in check (I’d be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge that we just hit 400,000 deaths on the day I’m writing this).CES 2021 was far from the first tech show to go all virtual over this past year. The size and scope of the event, on the other hand, are relatively unique here. Per the CTA, the 2020 show drew north of 170,000 attendees. The majority of the tech events I’ve attended virtually in the past year have been put on by a single company. CES is obviously a different beast entirely.The CTA’s (nee CEA) role in the industry certainly afforded it a fair bit of goodwill up front. The show, after all, dates back to the late-60s. It has ebbed and flowed over the years (taking hits from external forces like the 2008 financial crisis), but it has remained a constant. Those of us who’ve been doing this for a while tend to face the show with equal parts anticipation and dread. But the companies always come out.CES cancels Las Vegas event, goes online-onlyPer the CTA’s numbers, nearly 2,000 companies launched products at the 2021 event. The figure pales in comparison to the 4,419 companies exhibiting last year, but that’s to be expected. In addition to the uncertain nature of the event, it’s been a remarkably crappy year for plenty of companies. I certainly had my questions and doubts going in — chief among them was the value of an event like this for a startup? Without an in-person element, wasn’t this just yet another chance to get lost in the noise?I heard similar feedback from startups on the side, though ultimately nearly 700 chose to exhibit at the show. I know because I ended up going through all of them for the purposes of our coverage. It brought back a kind of visceral memory of the year I challenged myself to walk every square inch of the show, and ended up being challenging for entirely different reasons.Ultimately, this was the element I missed the most. For me, CES’s biggest appeal has been the element of discovery. Eureka Park, the jam-packed startup portion of the show at the Sands Expo, is easily the best part. The vast majority of exhibitors are not for us, but I still get a charge stumbling on something new and innovative I’ve not seen before. The blogger instinct that lives dormant inside kicks in and I can’t wait to get back in front of my laptop to tell the world.There was no Eureka Park this year — not even a virtual version. There’s just no good way to approximate a show floor online — at least none that I’m aware of. A couple of existing contacts offered to send me stuff in the mail to look out. Sensel, for instance, has a new version of its trackpad (which it announced today will be integrated into Lenovo’s latest ThinkPad). But for obvious reasons, it’s just not possible to get all 700 startups to send review units to my one-bedroom in Queens.More than anything, the virtual event highlighted the technology limitations of an event at this scale. Press conferences are simple enough (though I found frustration in the various different platforms the CTA employed). More often than not, these felt like lengthy commercials for the exhibiting company. The in-person versions are, as well, of course, but we tend to be blinded by the spectacle. For my own purposes, there just wasn’t a lot that that couldn’t have been accomplished more efficiently with a press release.The nature of news releases was far more nebulous this year. More companies seemingly took liberties by dumping their news well ahead of the show. Other companies offered their own sort of counter programming. One of the biggest advantages to these events when it comes to my own peace of mind is how they regulate the news flow. I know going into the year that there’s going to be one hair-pullingly difficult week at the beginning of the year where a ton of news is announced.With CES less of a center of gravity this year, I anticipated seeing a less segmented news flow. I’ve commented to colleagues over the last couple of years that there’s “no more slow season” when it comes to hardware news, and this will likely only increase that sentiment. Obviously there’s upside in having things more evenly spread out, but I’ve got the feeling we’re moving toward something more akin to a series of small CES-like events throughout the year, and the thought makes my blood turn cold.The pandemic was top of mind in the tech of CES 2021It’s been clear in recent years that companies would rather break out from the noise of CES in favor of their own events, following in Apple’s footsteps. Virtual events are a perfect opportunity to adopt that approach. Apple, meanwhile, moved from one event to a series of one smaller event every month toward the end of the year. When you’re not asking people to fly across the country or world to attend an event, the bar for what qualifies as news lowers considerably. Perhaps instead of having thousands of companies vying for our attention at one event, we’re moving toward a model in which there are instead thousands of events. The mind boggles.I have some hyper-specific grievances about the CTA’s format, but I’ll save them for the post-event survey that I may or may not get around to filling out. I still found value in the virtual event. It was an excuse to talk to a bunch of startups I wasn’t familiar with. Ultimately, however, I think the event served as a testament to the fact that as much as we bemoan all of the headaches and head colds that come with an event like CES, there’s still a lot of value to be had in the in-person event.There’s little doubt that the CTA and the rest of these sorts of organizations are champing at the bit to return to in-person events, even as a bumpy vaccine rollout leaves a big question mark around the expected timeline. There’s a very good chance that we’ll view 2020/2021 as the beginning of the end for the in-person trade show. But given the sorts of limitations we’ve seen in the past year, I’m not ready to declare them fully dead any time soon.']",Podchaser,"['Brian Heater@bheater', 'Spotify', '’ve', 'CES', 'Mobile World Congress', 'Mobile World Congress', 'IFA', 'The CTA’s', 'CEA', 'CTA', 'Eureka Park', 'Lenovo’s', 'CTA', 'CES', 'Apple’s', 'Apple', 'CTA', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/LlqVTqadXh,2021-01-19T23:20:49,Elon Musk said it was ‘Not a Flamethrower’,"['After two days locked up in an Italian prison, American Max Craddock was finally able to make his case to a judge.“It’s not a weapon of war,” his lawyer told the investigating magistrate. “It’s a toy they sell to children.”Craddock had been arrested in the Sardinian port city of Olbia in June 2018 after trying to board a private party bus with a collectible flamethrower from Elon Musk’s latest startup, The Boring Company. Craddock had painted his flamethrower black, and written on it the name of a floating music festival in the Bahamas he had attended the previous year while starring in reality TV show Unanchored.Alarmed by the sight of what he thought was a gun, the bus driver refused to drive off, and then called the police.Elon Musk’s Boring Co. flamethrower is real, $500 and up for pre-order“They were very chill at first,” Craddock told TechCrunch in a recent phone interview. “But as the night went on, it kept getting worse. I spent the first night in jail in Olbia and then they took me to prison.”When Craddock managed to get a lawyer, she told him the judge would probably just let him go with a warning. Instead, the magistrate ordered him back to his cell. That was when Craddock, pictured below, learned possession of a flamethrower in Italy can carry a 10-year prison sentence.A few months later, author John Richardson was sitting down to work at his home in London when there was a loud knock at the door. He opened it and five police officers barged in wearing tasers and tactical gear.“I think a couple of them also had handguns,” Richardson told TechCrunch. “But I’m slightly hazy on that because my legs went wobbly.”The police officers sat Richardson down on his sofa and informed him that they had a warrant to search the premises. “I was like, ‘what’s going on here?’ ” Richardson recalled. “Then something clicked and I said, ‘Is this about the flamethrower?’ ”The raid was indeed about his flamethrower.Craddock and Richardson are not the only Boring Company customers to have fallen foul of law enforcement.More than 1,000 flamethrower purchasers abroad have had their devices confiscated by customs officers or local police, with many facing fines and weapons charges. In the U.S., the flamethrowers have been implicated in at least one local and one federal criminal investigation. There have also been at least three occasions in which the Boring Company devices have been featured in weapons hauls seized from suspected drug dealers.The upshot: What Musk and his army of fans thought was just another of his money-spinning larks is having real-world consequences for people and countries not in on the joke.The Boring Company did not respond to detailed questions from TechCrunch for this story.The spark of an ideaInspired by Los Angeles traffic, Musk launched The Boring Company in December 2016. The startup’s mission was to solve urban traffic jams by moving cars through tiny tunnels. But re-engineering sewer tunneling technology to build a revolutionary subterranean transportation network doesn’t come cheap. In an effort to drum up awareness and funds, Musk announced in December 2017 a limited run of novelty flamethrowers designed and branded by The Boring Company.It was a scheme that had produced results earlier that year. Musk raised $1 million just weeks after launching sales of a $20 Boring Company hat.“I’m a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie,” Musk told Joe Rogan during an infamous podcast in 2018. “They have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs, and, like, the kids love that one.”The device uses a standard propane gas canister and is functionally similar to propane torches for melting ice, killing weeds or applying roofing materials. But with its rifle-style stock, pistol grip and sci-fi styling, the Boring Company’s flamethrower had a very different aesthetic — more post-apocalyptic party accessory than everyday yard maintenance.Musk did his best to hype sales, tweeting to his Twitter followers, which numbered about 22 million at the time: “Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty ‘match’ to ignite!”Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 9, 2018He also threw a launch party in Los Angeles, where Craddock was one of the first 1,000 customers to collect a flamethrower, just before his European trip. “I removed the gas canister, put the flamethrower in my carry-on, and had no trouble on the flights,” he said.Musk’s influence and the appeal of the product provided a winning combination.“I had no intention of going around setting fire to stuff,” said Richardson. “I just thought it looked pretty cool, and was something I could potentially flip for a lot more money down the line.”The Boring Company would make 20,000 flamethrowers and sell them at $500 each, netting the young company $10 million.‘Not’ a FlamethrowerThe 20,000 flamethrowers quickly sold out, with orders flooding in from around the world. As the shipping date neared, however, The Boring Company realized its scorching new product could also be a legal hot potato.“We are told that various countries would ban shipping of it, that they would ban flamethrowers,” Musk told Rogan in 2018. “So, to solve this problem for all of the customs agencies, we labelled it, ‘Not a Flamethrower.’ ““Did it work? Was it effective?” asked Rogan. “I don’t know. I think so. Yes,” Musk replied.The correct answer was no.Elon Musk’s flamethrower has already made well over $3.5 millionIn London, the flamethrower came to the attention of Operation Viper, a rapid response team dedicated to tackling gun crime. Working with customs officials, Viper tracked Musk’s flamethrowers en route to the nation’s capital. “There has been a debate as to whether these are firearms,” one of the Viper officers wrote in an email to Richardson. “Similar flamethrowers have been seized right across London.” One Londoner had his laptop and several cellphones confiscated along with the flamethrower.Flamethrower raids were also happening around the U.K. and across Europe. A YouTube vlogger in Manchester was targeted by police after featuring the Boring Company’s gadget in one of his videos, while up to 1,000 purchasers in Switzerland had devices confiscated and were issued fines. One took his case to court, saying the flamethrower was little different from a school Bunsen burner. He lost.Not just a European problemWithout the immediacy of a Customs check, the backlash to Musk’s flamethrowers in the United States took longer to arrive. But in June 2019, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate introduced a bill that would criminalize owning and using Musk’s flamethrower.“Elon Musk’s Boring Company released a new flamethrower… without any concern to the training of the purchasers or their reasons for buying,” reads S1637. “This bill establishes that owning and using a flamethrower is a criminal act, unless it is used for agricultural, construction or historical collection purposes. These dangerous devices should not be sold to civilians, and use needs to be restricted to trained professionals.”Not every police force believes that new laws are necessary — finding that existing ones are enough. In June 2020, police in Springfield, Massachusetts stopped a car for a missing inspection sticker. One of the officers noticed what he thought was a rifle hidden beneath a seat — actually a Boring Company flamethrower. Its owner, passenger Brandon McGee, was charged with carrying a dangerous weapon and an “infernal machine” (a device for endangering life or property using fire).The same month, FBI agents executing a search warrant against a Pennsylvania man, Brandon Althof Long, stumbled across his Boring Company flamethrower propped against a wall. Long had been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to riot and cause civil disorder, and conspiracy to use fire to commit a felony, during riots in Ohio protesting police brutality.The agents seized the flamethrower out of concern for their safety, which a U.S. district judge later ruled lawful. “Other individuals could be located inside the house and the flamethrower could have been used to endanger officers as they retreated from Long’s home,” she wrote.Novel items like flamethrowers are rarely specified in law, says Ryan Calo, a law professor and co-founder of the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington. “Some items – like guns or spring knives – are weapons ‘per se,’ meaning that they are always weapons. But most statutes have an ‘or other deadly weapon’ clause as well, meaning that anything that is capable of causing serious bodily harm, even a rock, can be a weapon in the right circumstances,” he said.The problem is, what circumstances? A flame-spouting weed-killer might not attract the interest of police, whereas a similar device styled like an assault rifle is more likely to be considered threatening. “And if you use the item during the commission of another crime, this can lead to a distinct offense of using a deadly weapon to commit a felony,” said Calo.For all Musk’s portrayal of the Not a Flamethrower as just an entertaining toy, police forces — and criminals — in North America are increasingly treating them as dangerous weapons. In rural Wisconsin, a two-year narcotics investigation led police to arrest two men in July 2020 with a hoard of drugs, cash and weapons. Among the cocaine, pistols and assault rifles prominently displayed in the traditional seizure photo was a Boring Company flamethrower. Similar seizures were displayed by police in Canada in December and again this month.Guelph Police Service lays out items seized including Not a Flamethrower, the novelty item sold by The Boring Company. Image credit: Guelph PoliceNo company has complete control over what customers do with its products. However, this isn’t the first time a product connected to Musk has been misused.Tesla, the electric automaker led by Musk, has been criticized for naming its advanced driver assistant system Autopilot and for calling the $10,000 add-on option Full Self-Driving (FSD), even though the driver must remain engaged at all times and is legally liable. A German court has banned the company from using the terms “Autopilot” or “full potential for autonomous driving” on its website or in other marketing materials.Elon Musk rails against German court decision on Tesla Autopilot terminologySafety advocates have argued that using terms like Autopilot and FSD misrepresents the capabilities of the system. The name, along with the lack of an in-cabin camera that monitors the driver, has led owners to push well beyond the bounds of the system.Videos showing Tesla owners misusing Autopilot and FSD abound on YouTube. Some have had run-ins with law enforcement. One Canadian man was charged for sleeping in his Tesla as it drove down the highway.Eternal flameImage Credits: Bryce DurbinJohn Richardson eventually got his Not a Flamethrower back from the Metropolitan police. He now intends to keep it out of the public eye, at least until it’s worth selling. “I’m happy to sit on it for however long,” he said. “And if there is a zombie apocalypse, at least I’ve got one.”For now, Craddock remains the only person that TechCrunch can identify as having been incarcerated solely for possessing a Not a Flamethrower. “It was a hair-raising experience,” he said. “I’m in the middle of nowhere in Sardinia, on 24-hour lockdown with an older guy giving off Mafia vibes.”After nearly a week in prison, Craddock was abruptly handed his belongings (flamethrower aside) and set free. “My lawyer asked the judge, ‘Do you really want to be the guy on international news keeping an American in jail over this toy?’ ” he said. “I think that was the key to getting me out.”Craddock took the first plane home. He says he now regrets taking the flamethrower abroad, and carrying it in public: “I would have preferred not to have spent that week in an Italian prison, but now I’ve got a hell of a story.”He also has another flamethrower.“As soon as I got back, I built myself a new one,” said Craddock. “You can follow YouTube videos with links to all the things you need.

https://t.co/a4RC5roVFx,2021-01-19T23:06:23,Podchaser raises $4M to build a comprehensive podcast database,"['Podchaser, a startup building what it calls “IMDB for podcasts,” recently announced that it has raised $4 million in a funding round led by Greycroft.In other words, it’s a site where — similar to the Amazon-owned Internet Movie Database — users can look up who’s appeared in which podcasts, rate and review those podcasts and add them to lists. In fact, CEO Bradley Davis told me that the startup’s “vibrant, exciting community of podcast nerds” have already created 8.5 million podcast credits in the database.Davis said this is something he simply wanted to exist and was, in fact, convinced that it had to exist already. When he realized that it didn’t, he posted on Reddit asking whether anyone was willing to build the company with him — which is how he connected with his eventual co-founder and CTO Ben Slinger in Australia. (Podchaser is a fully distributed company, with Davis currently based in Oklahoma City.)To be clear, Davis doesn’t think podcast nerds are the only ones taking advantage of the listings. Instead, he suggested that it’s useful for anyone looking to learn more about podcasts and discover new ones, with Podchaser’s monthly active users quintupling over the past year.For example, he said that one of the most popular pages is politician Pete Buttigieg’s profile, where visitors don’t just learn about Buttigieg’s own podcast but see others on which he’s appeared. (You can also use Podchaser to learn more about TechCrunch’s Equity, Mixtape and Original Content podcasts, though those profiles could stand to be filled out a bit more.)Podcast analytics and attribution startup Chartable raises $2.25MThere has been endless discussion about how to fix podcast discovery, and while Davis isn’t claiming that Podchaser will solve it wholesale, he thinks it can be part of the solution — not just through its own database, but through the broader Podcast Taxonomy project that it’s organizing.“I think if we are successful at standardizing a lot of the terminology, and if we do an analysis of all podcasts, of how popular they are, that [will help many listeners] to cull and find the good stuff,” he said.Podchaser plans to add new features that will further encourage user contributions, like a gamification system and a discussion system.While the consumer site is free, the startup recently launched a paid product called Podchaser Pro, which provides reach and demographic data across 1.8 million podcasts. It also monetizes by providing podcast players with access to its credits through an API.Davis said the startup was “lucky” that it decided to build a database that’s “agnostic” from any specific podcast player.“So we had a lot of latitude to work with those platforms, we integrate with many of those platforms and you’re going to see a lot of our credits showing up [in podcast players],” he said.In addition to Greycroft, Advancit Capital, LightShed Ventures, Powerhouse Capital, High Alpha, Hyde Park Venture Partners and Poplar Ventures also participated in the round, as did TrendKite founder A.J. Bruno, Ad Results Media CEO Marshall Williams and Shamrock Capital Partner Mike LaSalle.“Even in the face of a pandemic, the podcast market continues to grow at a breakneck pace,” said Greycroft co-founder and chairman Alan Patricof in a statement. “The demand from consumers and brands is insatiable.

Led by London-based XTX Ventures, this round brings the company’s total funding up to $7 million. The raise includes existing investor Metropolis VC, along with new additions Liquid 2 Ventures, GEM Capital, GPS Ventures and Andrew Filev.We first noted the company back in 2016, when it pitched a method for using drones to spot construction errors before they become too expense. It’s a pretty massive field that various technology companies are attempting to solve through a variety of different means, ranging from quadrupedal robots to site-scanning hard hats.Last February, TraceAir announced a new drone management tool. “Haul Router provides the best mathematically objective hauls for each given drone scan,” the company noted at the time. “Any employee can use the tool to design a haul road and export the results to feed into grading equipment.”The pandemic has thrown the construction industry for a loop (along with countless others). But unlike other sectors, demand still remains high in many places. TraceAir is hoping its solution will prove beneficial as many outfits seek a way to continue the process in spite of uncertainty.“The Covid-19 pandemic created new challenges for the U.S. and worldwide construction industries, resulting in delayed projects and growing unemployment rates,” CEO Dmitry Korolev said in a release tied to the news. “Our platform allows industry leaders to manage projects more efficiently and collaborate with their teams remotely, minimizing the need for a physical presence on-site.”TraceAir says the additional funding will go toward its sales and marketing, along with future product developments, including an unnamed product set for release this quarter.Construction startup Scaled Robotics raises a €2M seed round']",new S-1 filing,"['TraceAir', 'NavigationClose ScreenDrone-', 'TraceAir', 'XTX Ventures', 'Metropolis VC', 'Liquid 2 Ventures', 'GEM Capital', 'GPS Ventures', 'Andrew Filev', 'TraceAir', 'Haul Router', 'TraceAir', 'Dmitry Korolev', 'Scaled Robotics', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'FilevconstructiondronesEmerging-Technologiesliquid 2', 'TraceAir', 'XTX Ventures', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/18GjZnyiAz,2021-01-19T22:29:44,Facebook and Instagram’s AI-generated image captions now offer far more details,"['Every picture posted to Facebook and Instagram gets evaluated by an image analysis AI in order to create a caption, and that AI just got a lot smarter. The improved system should be a treat for visually impaired users, and may help you find your photos faster in the future.Alt text is a field in an image’s metadata that describes its contents: “A person standing in a field with a horse,” or “a dog on a boat.” This lets the image be understood by people who can’t see it.These descriptions are often added manually by a photographer or publication, but people uploading photos to social media generally don’t bother, if they even have the option. So the relatively recent ability to automatically generate one — the technology has only just gotten good enough in the last couple years — has been extremely helpful in making social media more accessible in general.Ava expands its AI captioning to desktop and web apps, and raises $4.5M to scaleFacebook created its Automatic Alt Text system in 2016, which is eons ago in the field of machine learning. The team has since cooked up many improvements to it, making it faster and more detailed, and the latest update adds an option to generate a more detailed description on demand.The improved system recognizes 10 times more items and concepts than it did at the start, now around 1,200. And the descriptions include more detail. What was once “Two people by a building” may now be “A selfie of two people by the Eiffel Tower.” (The actual descriptions hedge with “may be…” and will avoid including wild guesses.)But there’s more detail than that, even if it’s not always relevant. For instance, in this image the AI notes the relative positions of the people and objects:Image Credits: FacebookObviously the people are above the drums, and the hats are above the people, none of which really needs to be said for someone to get the gist. But consider an image described as “A house and some trees and a mountain.” Is the house on the mountain or in front of it? Are the trees in front of or behind the house, or maybe on the mountain in the distance?In order to adequately describe the image, these details should be filled in, even if the general idea can be gotten across with fewer words. If a sighted person wants more detail they can look closer or click the image for a bigger version — someone who can’t do that now has a similar option with this “generate detailed image description” command. (Activate it with a long press in the Android app or a custom action in iOS.)Perhaps the new description would be something like “A house and some trees in front of a mountain with snow on it.” That paints a better picture, right? (To be clear, these examples are made up, but it’s the sort of improvement that’s expected.)The new detailed description feature will come to Facebook first for testing, though the improved vocabulary will appear on Instagram soon. The descriptions are also kept simple so they can be easily translated to other languages already supported by the apps, though the feature may not roll out in other countries simultaneously.WTF is computer vision?']",survey,"['Instagram’s AI', 'Instagram’s AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'Ava', 'AI', 'Automatic Alt Text', 'the Eiffel Tower', 'AI', 'Android', 'WTF', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Instagram’s AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/oL9SX8g5vC,2021-01-19T22:13:38,Netflix’s ‘Shuffle Play’ feature will roll out to all users worldwide this year,"['Netflix is always in search of a better way to instantly connect users to something to watch, instead of having them waste time unsuccessfully scrolling through all the available programming options. Now, the company says a recent test focused on solving this problem, Shuffle Play, has proven popular enough to roll out to all users worldwide.In the streamer’s Q4 2020 earnings, announced today, Netflix noted the product development only briefly. It referred broadly to a test of a new feature that “gives members the ability to choose to instantly watch a title chosen just for them versus browse.” It also noted the feature would reach all users worldwide sometime in the first half of 2021.Netflix confirmed to TechCrunch the test in question is Shuffle Play, which we first covered back in August 2020. However, the company tells us the actual name of the feature is something that’s still being tested.Shuffle Play puts a big button right on the Netflix home screen, beneath your profile icon. When clicked, Netflix randomly plays content its personalization algorithms think you’ll like. This could include a movie you’re currently watching, something you’ve saved to your watch list or a title that’s similar to something you’ve already watched, for example.Netflix shares soar as it passes 200M paying subscribersA variation has also been spotted in the TV app’s sidebar navigation. More recently, we’ve found this sidebar option relabeled as “Shuffle Play,” instead of “Play Something” as before.In addition, as you start scrolling down through the Netflix home screen on the TV, you’ll eventually come across a screen that explains what the option is for and points to the new button with a red arrow.“Not sure what to watch?” this page asks, before explaining how Shuffle Play works.Image Credits: TechCrunchThe button has already appeared on some users’ Netflix app for TV devices, due to the ongoing tests.In its letter to shareholders, Netflix said the user response to Shuffle Play has been positive — which is funny because the original responses to the feature on social media were decidedly mixed. However, the company doesn’t make its decisions based on what a handful of tweets once said, but rather in how Netflix members actually used the product, of course.Netflix also tells us the feature is still being tested only on TV devices, not other platforms like web or mobile. It declined to say how many users or what percentage had been opted into the test to date.Shuffle Play is the latest in a long series of tests where Netflix has tried to make it easier to find something to watch right away.In 2019, for example, Netflix tried out a shuffle mode that let you click on a popular show to start playing a random episode. This may have worked well when users wanted to play a random episode of\xa0their default pick, like the “The Office” or “Friends,” but Netflix has lost both.It has also promoted its shows on the login screen and as screensavers, and notoriously autoplayed previews until last year, when it finally caved in to user demand for a way to turn this off.Netflix’s horrible autoplay previews can be turned offOverall, the goal is to make the Netflix experience closer to that of traditional TV, where you could switch the set on and content just started playing.Netflix says Shuffle Play will roll out globally in the first half of 2021, but didn’t share more specifics.']",reported,"['NavigationClose ScreenNetflix’s', 'Shuffle Play', 'Netflix', 'Shuffle Play', 'Netflix', '’ve', 'Netflix', 'Shuffle Play', 'Netflix', 'Netflix', 'Shuffle Play', 'Netflix', 'the “The Office', 'Netflix', 'Shuffle Play', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsMediaNetflixstreamingstreaming servicetelevisiontvNetflix’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

In 2019, the Germany-based enterprise giant SAP snatched up Qualtrics for $8 billion just before it was to go public. \n\t\t\tQualtrics is either worth less than we would have guessed, or its first IPO range feels light.\t\t\t\t\tThat figure provides a good marker for how well SAP has done with the deal and how much value Qualtrics has generated in the intervening years. Keep in mind, however, that the value of software companies has risen greatly in the last few years, so the numbers we’ll see below benefit from a market-wide repricing of recurring revenue.Qualtrics estimates that it may be worth $22 to $26 per share when it goes public. Is that a lot? Let’s find out.Qualtrics’ first IPO rangeFirst, scale. Qualtrics is selling just under 50 million shares in its public offering. As you can math out, at more than $20 per share, the company is looking to raise north of $1 billion.After going public, Qualtrics anticipates having 510,170,610 shares outstanding, inclusive of its 7.4 million underwriter option. Using that simple share count, Qualtrics would be worth $11.2 billion to $13.3 billion.']",Share on Twitter ,"['Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'Steve Jennings', 'Getty ImagesEarlier', 'Qualtrics', 'S-1', 'SAP', 'Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEnterpriseFundings &', 'Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Obviously, most VCs are in Dublin, but we don’t want to miss out on those based elsewhere.Our survey will only be about investors, and only the contributions of VC investors will be included. More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey.The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.You can fill out the survey here.Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?This survey is part of a broader series of surveys we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.For example, here is the recent survey of London.You are not in Dublin, but would like to take part? That’s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your city next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.The survey is covering almost every country on the continent of Europe (not just EU members, btw), so just look for your country and city on the survey and please participate (if you’re a venture capital investor).Thank you for participating.

Disney+ had a massive first year (87 million paid subscribers!) and we recorded the biggest year of paid membership growth in our history.”EMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom made a similar point in a statement:Netflix ended 2020 on a high note, adding over 36 million subscribers and passing 200 million subscribers.

https://t.co/mGMAzCNheC,2021-01-19T20:15:22,How and when to build marketing teams at deep tech companies,"['Jessica LiContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tJessica is on the growth marketing team at Zageno, a multivendor, online marketplace for life science products, and is head of content at Elpha, a Y Combinator-backed community of 40,000+ women in tech. \tMore posts by this contributor4 strategies for deep tech startups recruiting top growth marketers4 strategies for deep tech founders who are fundraisingDeep tech startups develop cutting-edge innovations with the power to truly revolutionize society. The founding team members at these companies often come from deeply technical backgrounds, which powers rapid product progress but can create bottlenecks on the go-to-market side.In this post, I outline the answers to four key questions around marketing at early-stage deep tech companies that are post-revenue:What marketing teams at deep tech companies do.When to hire the marketing team.Whether the marketing team needs industry experience.How to source and evaluate talent for the marketing team.From this post, deep tech startups can formulate their marketing hiring strategy and attract and cultivate top talent to drive their go-to-market plan. Without business execution, even the most groundbreaking innovations do not achieve their intended impact.What do marketing teams at deep tech companies do? To set the context, I share below the typical projects of deep tech marketing teams, which look different from marketing in other industries given the greater product focus and complexity, regulatory oversight and longer time to market.Go-to-marketMarketers leverage the strength of the IP to establish collaborations with large companies, such as pharma companies and institutions, such as the government, universities or hospitals. To this end, marketers develop creative ways to gather lists of, and information on, key contacts at these potential partners. They also build sales collateral, such as demo videos, pitch decks and one-pagers, to more effectively reach and build long-term relationships with these prospects.More broadly, marketers also develop the go-to-market strategy beyond partnerships. To this end, marketers conduct in-depth market research on business models, monetization strategies and reimbursement channels.CommunicationsMarketers create original content to establish the company as a thought leader, build the company’s brand credibility through social media and apply for awards and honors to validate the potential of the company’s solution.ForecastingMarketers work with finance and product teams to formulate projections as the company moves into the clinical phase.When should deep tech companies hire marketers?The CEO and other members of the founding team take on marketing work in the formation stage to better understand and empathize with the needs, capabilities and opportunities in the department before bringing someone on full time.Once the product shows signs of repeatable revenue, a marketing lead is needed. Specifically, this is ahead of a large Series A round, after a small Series A round or when a commercial partner has expressed interest in larger, long-term contracts. Instead of the typical chief marketing officer or chief revenue officer title, deep tech startups call this person a chief commercial officer or chief partnerships officer.For additional support in the formation stage, companies bring on MBA interns and work with their investors. Prior to the Series A, platform teams at deep tech venture-capital funds are hands-on in helping with marketing through actually doing marketing projects for their portfolio companies, ideating on long-term marketing strategy with the founders through regular feedback sessions and connecting founders with vetted marketing contractors or agencies.For companies that require FDA approval, commercial advisors, consultants and board members fully take on the partnership strategy work (which represents the bulk of the marketing needs) prior to the Series A round. Similarly, external consultants, such as marketing agencies, can take over major projects like launch strategy. External consultants can then join the team should their performance be strong.For drug-development companies, the marketing leader is most crucial when the company enters the clinical phase and prepares for trials, regardless of funding stage.Do marketing hires need industry experience? Of course, it is ideal to hire someone with experience selling into the space and someone who is comfortable with the complex supply chains and long sales cycles. However, if the choice is between someone with functional expertise but no industry expertise and someone with industry experience but limited or no functional expertise, it is better to hire the former candidate and leverage the rest of the team for domain expertise. Deep tech is a niche area, so the other team members can support the marketer in developing industry expertise.']",Volta,"['Li@jessicafeiyali', 'Andy Roberts', 'Getty ImagesJessica', 'Jessica', 'IP', 'ForecastingMarketers', 'FDA', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsColumnLaborStartupsTCdeep techEC', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/WztgWtpqnR,2021-01-19T19:49:36,SpaceX bought two oil rigs to convert into offshore launch pads for Starship,"['SpaceX’s next spacecraft is in development in Texas, and CEO Elon Musk previously revealed that the company was planning to build floating spaceports for Starship operations, after a job ad was posted looking for someone to oversee their development. Now, SpaceX has purchased two oil rigs to convert for this purpose, as first reported by spaceflight.com’s Michael Baylor, and confirmed by CNBC.The rigs have been named Deimos and Phoibos by SpaceX, which are the names of the two moons of Mars (and the names of the gods of both dread and fear in Greek mythology before that). The rigs were originally designed for offshore deepwater drilling, up to a maximum depth of 8,500 feet. They’re currently located in Brownsville, a port city on the Gulf of Mexico near SpaceX’s Starship development site in Brownsville, Texas.These vessels measure 240 feet by 255 feet and will in theory be repurposed to support launching of Starship (and perhaps return landing, given their reusable design). Thus far, SpaceX has been launching and landing its Starship prototypes on land at its Boca Chica site, though it’s only done lower altitude flights so far. The company also operates two drone ships, which are 300 feet long by around 170 feet wide, as autonomous floating landing pads for its current Falcon 9 rocket boosters.SpaceX also posted another ad seeking a resort development manager to turn its south Texas facility into a “21st century spaceport,” specifically looking for someone with resort expertise. Meanwhile, Musk confirmed that he has moved to Texas last December, following a number of public suggestions that he would do so owing in part to California’s taxation and regulatory environment.Tesla picks Austin for its next US factory to build Cybertruck, Semi truck, Model YMusk’s other company Tesla also selected Austin as the site of its next gigafactory in the U.S., intended for assembly of its Cybertruck, Model Y and Tesla Semi, as well as Model 3 cars destined for customers on the east coast. SpaceX has maintained engine test facilities in McGreger, Texas, and set up Boca Chica as one of two Starship development sites alongside Florida, before making the south Texas location the sole focus for that spacecraft’s construction and testing after consolidating its efforts.']",said today,"['NavigationClose', 'StarshipDarrell Etherington@etherington /', 'Elon Musk', 'Michael Baylor', 'CNBC.The', 'Deimos', 'Falcon', 'Musk', 'Tesla', 'Austin', 'Cybertruck', 'Model YMusk’s', 'Tesla', 'Austin', 'Cybertruck', 'Tesla Semi', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'StarshipDarrell', 'Elon Musk', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/9JeAwHjK4y,2021-01-19T19:20:02,Uppbeat launches a freemium music platform aimed at YouTubers,"['A new music platform, Uppbeat, aims to make it easier for YouTubers and other content creators to find quality free music to use in their videos. The system, which is designed to navigate the complexities of copyright claims while also fairly compensating artists, offers an alternative to existing free music platforms, including YouTube’s own Audio Library and Creative Commons’ legal music for videos, for example.The idea for the startup comes from Lewis Foster and Matt Russell, the U.K.-based co-founders of another music-licensing company, Music Vine, which has been operating for about six years.Last year, the co-founders realized there was a growing opportunity to address the creator space with a slightly different product.“We were realizing, more and more, was that the creator space — YouTubers, streamers, podcasters — has become enormous, but there wasn’t a music platform that was doing a nice job for those type of users,” explains Foster. “So we sat down and thought about what the perfect music resource would look like for creators. That led to deciding to build Uppbeat,” he says.They began developing the Uppbeat website in September 2020 and launched it to the public on Monday.On the creators’ side, Uppbeat’s key focus is on eliminating headaches over copyright claims, particularly on YouTube.Currently, if a YouTuber gets a copyright claim over music in their video, it can cause them to lose income. Though YouTube has worked to address this problem over the years with new features and changes to its Content ID match system, it’s still an issue.“If a YouTuber gets a copyright claim, [YouTube] can de-monetize their video. And if they go through YouTube’s dispute system, it can take as long as 30 days for it to get resolved. It’s a pretty big frustration for YouTubers,” Foster says.Uppbeat’s music will instead almost instantly clear the claims.Image Credits: UppbeatSimilar to Spotify, the Uppbeat website leverages a freemium model, To get started, creators can sign up for a free account that provides access to about 50% of the site’s roughly 1,000-track music catalog and 10 downloads per month. The paid plan offers full catalog access and no download limit.Free users simply add a credit to their YouTube video description to clear copyright claims, while paid users are added to an approved list, eliminating this extra step.Because the tracks have to be fingerprinted to fight off unlicensed usage, a copyright claim will still occur. But instead of taking days or weeks to resolve, it will be cleared within about five minutes, the company says. The Uppbeat system clears the claim by checking the video description for the necessary credit and by checking the claim against its list of paid users. This is all automated, too, which helps to speed things up.Image Credits: UppbeatMeanwhile, on the artists’ side, Uppbeat pays as their music is used — even by the free users.The revenue from the premium subscriptions, and soon, advertising, is divided between the artists on a monthly basis, in proportion to the number of downloads the artist receives.“What that means from the artists’ perspective is, on average, they’re going to make the same amount from tracks on the premium side as they do on the free side,” says Lewis. “It means, even for free usage, they will get paid,” he adds.The site will also monetize through audio ads that play as you browse the tracks and listen to the music. (However, these are just promoting the paid plan for the time being.)Browsing Uppbeat’s catalog is easy, too. The music is organized by genre, theme and style in colorful rows that aim to introduce all the different types of music and beats a YouTuber may need. For example, there’s music customized for use\xa0 in the background and other tracks that cater to different moods like inspiring, calm, happy, dramatic and more. A catalog of SFX (sound effects) is expected to be added in a few months, too.Uppbeat believes its existing music industry connections with producers, composers and songwriters via Music Vine will help them to source higher-quality tracks than other free music services.At present, the startup is self-funded through revenues from Music Vine, but Foster says they’ve had some VC interest. For now, though, the founders are looking to keep the ownership in-house, for the most part.However, Uppbeat is experimenting with both a referral program and a profit-sharing scheme. The latter will allow YouTubers who bring Uppbeat new customers, then take the full revenue from those customers for two years’ time.“We’re taking a massive sacrifice,” Foster admits. “But from from our perspective, the faster we can get Uppbeat out there and well-known in the YouTuber space, then we’re happy to share that [revenue]. We think it’s a cool idea to share that within the YouTuber community, rather than [take] a big private investment,” he notes.The startup is also considering making shares in the company available to some larger YouTubers, Foster adds.Today, Uppbeat is a team of eight employees and 12 freelancers, based in Leeds, U.K.YouTube shuts down music companies’ use of manual copyright claims to steal creator revenue\xa0']", infrastructure bets,"['YouTubers', 'NavigationClose ScreenUppbeat', 'YouTubers', 'YouTube', 'Audio Library', 'Lewis Foster', 'Matt Russell', 'Music Vine', 'YouTubers', 'Foster', 'Uppbeat', 'Uppbeat’s', 'YouTube', 'YouTuber', 'YouTube', 'Content', 'YouTuber', 'YouTube', 'YouTubers', 'Foster', 'Uppbeat’s', 'UppbeatSimilar', 'Spotify', 'YouTube', 'UppbeatMeanwhile', 'Lewis', 'SFX', 'Foster', '’ve', 'VC', 'Uppbeat', 'YouTubers', 'YouTubers', 'Foster', 'Uppbeat', 'U.K.YouTube', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Perez8:20 PM', 'YouTubers', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/svi04SrVXU,2021-01-19T18:42:40,Europe is working on a common framework for ‘vaccine passports’,"['The European Union is preparing the ground for vaccine passports. A common approach for mutual recognition of vaccination documentation is of the “utmost importance,” the commission said today, adding that it wants “an appropriate trust framework” to be agreed upon by the end of January — “to allow member states’ certificates to be rapidly useable in health systems across the EU and beyond.”“Vaccination certificates allow for a clear record of each individual’s vaccination history, to ensure the right medical follow-up as well as the monitoring of possible adverse effects,” it writes, adding that: “A common EU approach to trusted, reliable and verifiable certificates would allow people to use their records in other member states. Though it is premature to envisage the use of vaccine certificates for other purposes than health protection, an EU approach may facilitate other cross-border applications of such certificates in the future.”It’s not clear what form (or forms) these pan-EU coronavirus vaccine certificates will take as yet — but presumably there will be both paper-based and digital formats, to ensure accessibility.Nor is it clear exactly how EU citizens’ identity and medical data will be protected as checks on vaccination status take place. Or, indeed, who the trusted entities storing and managing sensitive health data will be. All that detail is to come — and may well vary by member state, depending on how immunity certification verification systems get implemented.Last week a number of tech companies, including Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce, announced involvement in a separate, cross-industry effort to establish a universal standard for vaccination status that they said would build on existing standards, such as the SMART Health Cards specification that adheres to HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources).Tech and health companies including Microsoft and Salesforce team up on digital COVID-19 vaccination recordsThat tech-backed effort is pushing for an “encrypted digital copy of [a person’s] immunization credentials to store in a digital wallet of their choice,” with a backup available as a printed QR code that includes W3C-standards verifiable credentials for those not wanting or able to use a smartphone. The PR also talked about a “privacy-preserving health status verification” solution that is at least in part “blockchain-enabled.”Nothing so specific is being proposed for the common EU approach as yet. And it looks clear that a number of vaccine credential standards will be put forward globally — as a potential universal standard. (The commission is touting its forthcoming framework on that front too.)Whatever is devised in the EU must ensure compliance with the region’s data protection framework (which bakes in requirements for security and privacy by design and default when processing people’s information). So it could offer better privacy protection than a private sector-led effort, for example.The EU’s eHealth Network — a body that includes representatives from relevant member states’ authorities who are supported by a wider European Joint Action body, called eHAction — will be responsible for defining the minimum dataset needed for vaccination certificates used at the EU level, per the commission.It says this must include “a unique identifier and an appropriate trust framework ensuring privacy and security.”Expect relevant stakeholders such as Europe’s Data Protection Supervisor and Data Protection Board to weigh in with expert advice, as happened last year with coronavirus contacts tracing apps.EU privacy body urges anonymization of location data for COVID-19 tracking“The commission will continue to work with member states on vaccination certificates that can be recognised and used in health systems across the EU in full compliance with EU data protection law — and scaled up globally through the certification systems of the World Health Organisation,” EU lawmakers add, saying the forthcoming framework will be presented in the WHO “as a possible universal standard.”Commenting in the challenges ahead for developing privacy-safe vaccination verification, Lukasz Olejnik, a Europe-based independent cybersecurity and privacy researcher and consultant, told TechCrunch: “It is tricky to follow privacy by design for this particular [use-case]. It is unclear if anyone will be interested in identifying possible innovative privacy-preserving frameworks such as anonymous cryptographic credentials.“In the end perhaps we will end up with some approach using verifiable credentials, but establishing trust will remain a challenge. What will be the source of trust? Is it possible to prove a particular status without the need to disclose the user identity? These are the core questions.”“I hope this proposal will be public and transparent,” he added of the EU framework.It’s worth emphasizing that all this effort is a bit “cart before the horse” at this stage — being as it’s still not confirmed whether any of the currently available COVID-19 vaccinations, which have been developed primarily to protect the recipient from serious illness, also prevent transmission of the disease or not.Nonetheless, systems for verifying proof of immunization status are fast being spun up — ushering in the possibility of “vaccine passport” checks for travelers within the EU down the road, for example. It’s also not hard to envisage businesses requesting COVID-19 vaccination certification before granting access to a physical facility or service, in a bid to reassure customers they can spend money safety — i.e., once such documentation exists and can be verified in a standardized way.Standardized frameworks for vaccination credentials could certainly have very broad implications for personal freedoms in the near future, as well as wide ramifications for privacy — depending on how these systems are architected, managed and operated.Europe’s privacy and security research community mobilized heavily last year as the pandemic triggered early proposals to develop coronavirus contacts tracing apps — contributing to a push for exposure notification apps to be decentralized to ensure privacy of individuals’ social graph. However efforts toward establishing vaccination certification systems don’t appear to have generated the same level of academic engagement as yet.In an analysis of the implications of immunity certificates, published last month, Privacy International warned that any systems that require proof of vaccination for entry or a service would be unfair “until everyone has access to an effective vaccine” — a bar that remains far off indeed.European countries, which are among the global leaders on COVID-19 vaccination rollouts, have still only immunized tiny minorities of their national populations so far. (Even as the commission today urged member states to set targets to vaccinate a minimum of 80% of health and social care professionals and people over 80 by March 2021; and at least 70% of the total adult population by summer — targets that look like fantastical wishful thinking right now.)“Governments must find alternatives to delivering vaccination schemes that do not perpetuate and reinforce exclusionary and discriminatory practices,” the rights group further urged, also warning that COVID-19 immunity should not be used as a justification for expanding or instating digital identity schemes.Uber and Moderna partner on COVID-19 vaccine access and information']",announcement,"['Lomas@riptari', 'Dogukan Keskinkilic', 'Getty ImagesThe European Union', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'Microsoft', 'Oracle and Salesforce', 'the SMART Health Cards', 'Microsoft', 'EU', 'EU', 'eHealth Network', 'European Joint Action', 'EU', 'Europe’s', 'Data Protection Board', 'EU', 'COVID-19', 'EU', 'EU', 'the World Health Organisation', 'EU', 'WHO', 'Lukasz Olejnik', '”“I', 'EU', 'EU', 'Privacy International', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Lomas7:42', '2021The European Union', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/j50IgLYHdJ,2021-01-19T18:01:34,6 investors on 2021’s mobile gaming trends and opportunities,"['Many VCs historically avoided placing bets on hit-driven mobile gaming content in favor of clearer platform opportunities, but as more success stories pop up, the economics overturned conventional wisdom with new business models. As more accessible infrastructure allowed young studios to become more ambitious, venture money began pouring into the gaming ecosystem.After tackling topics including how investors are looking at opportunities in social gaming, infrastructure bets and the moonshots of AR/VR, I asked a group of VCs about their approach to mobile content investing and whether new platforms were changing perspectives about opportunities in mobile-first and desktop-first experiences.While desktop gaming has evolved dramatically in the past few years as new business models and platforms take hold, to some degree, mobile has been hampered. Investors I chatted with openly worried that some of mobile’s opportunities were being hamstrung by Apple’s App Store.“We are definitely fearful of Apple’s ability to completely disrupt/affect the growth of a game,” Bessemer’s Ethan Kurzweil and Sakib Dadi told TechCrunch. “We do not foresee that changing any time in the near future despite the outcry from companies such as Epic and others.”All the while, another central focus seems to be the ever-evolving push toward cross-platform gaming, which is getting further bolstered by new technologies. One area of interest for investors: migrating the ambition of desktop titles to mobile and finding ways to build cross-platform experiences that feel fulfilling on devices that are so differently abled performance-wise.Madrona’s Hope Cochran, who previously served as CFO of Candy Crush maker King, said mobile still has plenty of untapped opportunities. “When you have a AAA game, bringing it to mobile is challenging and yet it opens up an entire universe of scale.”Responses have been edited for length and clarity. We spoke with:Hope Cochran, managing director, Madrona Venture GroupDaniel Li, partner, Madrona Venture GroupEthan Kurzweil, partner, Bessemer Venture PartnersSakib Dadi, investor, Bessemer Venture PartnersAlice Lloyd George, founding partner, Rogue VCGigi Levy-Weiss, general partner, NFXHope Cochran and Daniel Li, Madrona Venture GroupDoes it ever get any easier to bet on a gaming content play? What do you look for?Hope Cochran: I feel like there are a couple different sectors in gaming. There’s the actual studios that are developing games and they have several approaches. Are they developing a brand new game, are they reimagining a game from 25 years ago and reskinning it, which is a big trend right now, or are they taking IP that is really trendy right now and trying to create a game around it? There are different ways to predict which ones of those might make it, but then there’s also the infrastructure behind gaming and then there’s also identifying trends and which games or studios are embracing those. Those are some of the ways I try to parse it out and figure out which ones I think are going to rise to the top of the list.Daniel Li: There’s this single-player narrative versus multiplayer metaverse and I think people are more comfortable on the metaverse stuff because if you’re building a social network and seeing good early traction, those things don’t typically just disappear. Then if you are betting more on individual studios producing games, I think the other thing is we’re seeing more and more VCs pop up that are just totally games-focused or devoting a portion of the portfolio to games. And for them it’s okay to have a hits-driven portfolio.There seems to be more innovation happening on PC/console in terms of business models and distribution, do you think mobile feels less experimental these days? Why or why not?Hope Cochran: Mobile is still trying to push the technology forward, the important element of being cross-platform is difficult. When you have a AAA game, bringing it to mobile is challenging and yet it opens up an entire universe of scale. The metrics are also very different for mobile though.Daniel Li: It seems like the big monetization innovation that has happened over the last couple of years has been the “battle pass” type of subscription where you can unlock more content by playing. Obviously that’s gone over to mobile, but it doesn’t feel like mobile has had some sort of new monetization unlock. The other thing that’s happened on desktop is the success of the “pay $10 or $20 or $20 for this indie game” type of thing, and it feels like that’s not going to happen on mobile because of the price points that people are used to paying.Alice Lloyd George, Rogue VC']",TC Sessions: Justice on March 3,"['Apple', 'AR/VR', 'Apple’s App Store', 'Apple', 'Bessemer’s', 'Ethan Kurzweil', 'Sakib Dadi', 'Madrona', 'Cochran', 'CFO', 'Candy Crush', 'AAA', 'Cochran', 'Madrona Venture', 'GroupDaniel Li', 'Madrona Venture', 'GroupEthan Kurzweil', 'Bessemer Venture PartnersSakib Dadi', 'Bessemer Venture PartnersAlice Lloyd George', 'VCGigi Levy-Weiss', 'Cochran', 'Daniel Li', 'Madrona Venture GroupDoes', 'Cochran', 'IP', 'Daniel Li', 'Cochran', 'AAA', 'Daniel Li', 'Alice Lloyd George', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Levy-WeissHope Cochraninvestor', 'Lucas Matney7:01 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/U3DjPyY70N,2021-01-15T20:37:01,15 steps to fundraising a new VC or private equity fund,"['David TetenContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tDavid Teten is founder of Versatile VC and writes periodically at teten.com and @dteten.\tMore posts by this contributor15 steps to fundraising a new VC or private equity fund12 ‘flexible VCs’ who operate where equity meets revenue shareLaunching is easy; fundraising is harder.I’ve been fortunate to be a partner at two different VC firms over the past nine years, and we’ve grown AUM 10x both times.Based on my experience, taking the 15 steps below will help build the core of a high-performing fundraising and investor relations function.1. Build the firm as much as possible before soliciting LPsThe more baked you are, the more investable you are. The best possible move is to invest in and warehouse some special purpose vehicles that fit your strategy. However, that may distract you from the larger goal of raising a fund, not just a special purpose vehicle.The next best move is to build your core team, e.g., recruit an advisory board, venture partners and EIRs. Lastly, gather feedback. Yohei Nakajima, founder of Untapped.vc, said, “Before pitching LPs and building my firm, I talked with over 50 people I knew to get feedback.”2. Set up a basic marketing toolkit: Deck, website and social mediaIt’s virtually mandatory to develop a detailed, data-backed deck and ideally a video pitch. Your materials should ideally meet the expectations of the Institutional Limited Partners Association, even if you’re not targeting institutions. Keep these documents constantly up to date, so all team members are aligned on key numbers, e.g., total dollars raised so far. You’ll look unprofessional if you’re not coordinated.Fundamentally, almost no one invests based on a deck; they want to talk with the people. However, a high-credibility deck opens the door to a meeting where you then have the chance to sell yourself.Note that limited partners view formatting as a proxy for professionalism. It’s worth investing a little money in a graphic designer who can design a consistent website, business card, logo and presentation templates.Richard Dukas, CEO, Dukas Linden Public Relations, said, “If you don’t have a website and have no material online presence, you likely won’t get past the first hurdle with potential investors.”When you’re fundraising, you’re selling a luxury good. The less widely marketed your fund, the more valuable it is perceived to be. For example, one LP told me she prefers to receive customized emails from fund principals, as opposed to a bulk-mailed quarterly update. An extreme example of this are venture capitalists who don’t even bother with a website, e.g., Benchmark and Thrive Capital. They are the equivalent of a nightclub with an unmarked door, but other investors will need to shape up their social media tech stack.3. Make your online profile data-driven and internally consistentAll team members should have internally consistent and professional profiles on Linkedin at a minimum and typically also on Twitter, Facebook and/or other platforms you use. In particular, highlight the metrics by which you measured your past activities: size of exit, number of people you managed, budget you were responsible for, etc.4. Set up a data room with a completed due diligence questionnaireAmong the most important information to include: details on return history, legal documents, fund organization chart, portfolio construction model, portfolio company one-pagers, key personnel resumes and case studies of past investments. We are using Digify to manage this.5. Prepare FAQs for prospective LPsYou will inevitably receive a wide range of one-off questions from potential LPs. Make sure to compile all your answers in a single document so that you can recycle and refine these answers.']",Northzone,"['VC', 'eExtra Crunch15', 'VC', 'Cristian Bortes/EyeEm', 'David Teten', 'Versatile VC', 'VC', 'VC', 'Yohei Nakajima', 'Untapped.vc', 'the Institutional Limited Partners Association', 'Richard Dukas', 'Dukas Linden Public Relations', 'Benchmark and Thrive Capital', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'eExtra Crunch15', 'VC', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/8ljAvUyNZC,2021-01-19T16:41:16,"Apple’s new editorial franchise, Apple Podcasts Spotlight, to highlight interesting creators","['Apple today announced a new editorial franchise called Apple Podcasts Spotlight, which aims to highlight rising podcast creators in the U.S. The editorial team at Apple will select new podcast creators to feature every month and then give them prominent screen real estate in the Apple Podcasts app and promote them across social media and elsewhere. This will allow creators to reach a wider audience, similar to how the App Store showcases a selection of recommended apps and games with large banners at the top of its screen.The first Spotlight creator is Chelsea Devantez, who hosts the podcast Celebrity Book Club. On Fridays, Chelsea and special guests including Emily V. Gordon, Gabourey Sidibe, Ashley Nicole Black and Lydia Popovich will meet to discuss the memoirs of “badass celebrity womxn,” as an announcement describes it.The idea for the show began a year ago when Devantez was reading Jessica Simpson’s memoir and started recapping it on Instagram. The reaction from her followers prompted her to expand the concept into a podcast.Upcoming episodes will feature Oscar-nominated writer and producer Emily V. Gordon talking Drew Barrymore’s “Little Girl Lost;” actress Stephanie Beatriz discussing Celine Dion’s memoir “My Story My Dream;” Leighton Meester on Carly Simon’s “Boys in the Trees;” and a special Valentine’s Day episode where Chelsea and TikTok star Rob Anderson read Burt Reynolds’ and Loni Anderson’s competing divorce memoirs.“Apple Podcasts Spotlight helps listeners find some of the world’s best shows by shining a light on creators with singular voices,” said Ben Cave, Global Head of Business for Apple Podcasts, in a statement about the launch. “Chelsea Devantez has created a fun, vibrant space with Celebrity Book Club for listeners to gain new perspectives on the celebrities we thought we knew. We are delighted to recognize Chelsea and Celebrity Book Club as our first Spotlight selection and look forward to introducing creators like Chelsea to listeners each month,” he added.Apple says future Spotlight creators will be announced monthly from across a range of podcast genres, formats and locations, and will often focus on independent and underrepresented voices. The content is previewed ahead of selection to ensure quality, but there are no specific requirements about the podcast size and reach.In general, the new Spotlight creators will debut toward the front of the week, but the specific days are fluid to adapt to holidays, major cultural events and others. The next Spotlight selection, for example, will launch in mid-February.The Spotlight creators will be featured at the top of the Browse tab of Apple Podcasts and will be promoted through the Apple Podcasts social media accounts. Some form of in-app featuring will continue throughout the entire month the creators are in the “spotlight.”Apple says it will also collaborate with the featured creators on their own channels. Over time, you’ll see promotion via additional Apple-operated channels including outdoor advertising in major U.S. metros.The news of the new editorial program comes shortly after a report from The Information suggested Apple is working to expand its podcasts platform with the introduction of a podcast subscription service, threatening rivals like Spotify, SiriusXM and Amazon.Though Apple Podcasts still leads the market, Spotify has been catching up by spending over $800 million on podcast companies, like Anchor, the Ringer, Gimlet Media, and more recently, podcast ad company Megaphone.SiriusXM, meanwhile, bought podcast management and analytics platform Simplecast, ad tech platform AdsWizz, and podcast app Stitcher. Not to be left out, Amazon just a few weeks ago announced it was acquiring the podcast network Wondery.Beyond helping the creators grow their audience, Apple says the larger goal with the program is to welcome new audiences to podcasts, in general.Though podcasts are growing in popularity, the monthly podcast listener base is just 37% in the U.S., according to Edison Research. That means it’s nowhere near being an activity that’s popular among a majority of the U.S. population at this time. Before Apple can effectively monetize podcasts as a subscription service, it needs to help get more people listening to podcasts on a regular basis.Apple declined to say if the program would expand outside the U.S. at a later date.Spotify buying podcast hosting and ad company Megaphone for $235M']",announced,"['Apple’s', 'Apple Podcasts Spotlight', 'NavigationClose ScreenApple’s', 'Apple Podcasts Spotlight', 'Apple Podcasts Spotlight', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Chelsea Devantez', 'Chelsea', 'Emily V.

Is there a way to ensure a safety net for the people who need it the most?As the pandemic continued to rage, California passed Proposition 22. The law was regarded as a big win for companies like Uber and Lyft (who pumped a collective $200 million into promotions) and a tremendous step back for workers looking for basic employment rights. But the battle between the Prop 22 proponents and the gig workers who oppose it continues. A group of rideshare drivers in California and the Service Employees International Union have filed a lawsuit\xa0alleging Proposition 22 violates California’s constitution.To discuss the gig worker economy and its future in a post-Prop-22 world, we will be joined by Jessica E.

As a Northzone principal, she’s already been involved in the firm’s investments in Spring Health (mental health), 3box (cloud infrastructure), Livepeer (blockchain-based video transcoding) and\xa0Magic.link (user authentication).More broadly, Northzone says Schadeck helped to develop the firm’s investment theses around crypto, consumer technology, health and developer/web 3.0 infrastructure.“Wendy has already proven herself through very insightful sector-driven thought leadership and has solidified our position in the New York ecosystem,” said General Partner Pär-Jörgen Pärson in a statement. “She has defined and redefined an honest, authentic and inspiring dialogue between herself as an investor and the entrepreneurs she supports.”Schadeck told me that her interests have “crystallized” around three key areas — “open data, open finance and open community.” And she said that with her promotion to partner, she will be able to work even more closely with founders, a topic she’s become “obsessed” with.“We’ve all seen this VC meme, ‘How can I be helpful?’ and I’ve sometimes accidentally literally said it,” Schadeck said. “But we mean it: Other than providing capital, first and foremost, on good terms, what other dimensions are there that are becoming more and more important?

Today, the company says it has set a launch date for Paramount+ in the U.S.: March 4, 2021. It’s also sharing the launch dates for other international markets, including Latin America, Canada and the Nordics.The service will debut on March 4 in Latin American markets and will rebrand from CBS All Access to Paramount+ in Canada at the same time. However, Canada won’t receive the expanded lineup until later in 2021. The Nordics region will see the service arrive on March 25, 2021, which is followed by a launch in Australia in “mid-2021.”The company had been touting its plans for the rebranded service since earlier last year, explaining how the new streaming offering, an expansion of CBS All Access, would allow it to showcase the company’s biggest franchises and its deep library, while also offering a home to its growing collection of original content, like the multiple “Star Trek” series now streaming on CBS All Access and “The Good Wife” spin-off, “The Good Fight,” among others.The service will also continue to stream sports, like NFL games and those from other leagues, like the NCAA and PGA, and live stream news from CBSN and local stations.Last year, ViacomCBS additionally announced other originals it had planned for the new service, including “The Offer,” a scripted limited series about the making of “The Godfather”; CIA spy drama “Lioness,” created by Taylor Sheridan; a reimagined version of VH1’s “Behind the Music,” which will focus on the past 40 years; a true crime docuseries, “The Real Criminal Minds,” based on the fictional TV hit; and a revival of BET’s “The Game.”There will be expanded children’s programming, too, including a new kids original series “Kamp Koral,” from Nickelodeon’s “Spongebob Squarepants.” And it it will be the subscription video-on-demand home for the “The Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run.”CBS All Access had already been expanding its lineup ahead of the full rebrand, with the goal of reaching more than 30,000 episodes and movies, by incorporating content from ViacomCBS-owned brands like BET, CBS, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures.Despite its plans to make Paramount+ a standalone destination, ViacomCBS has been licensing its content to other streamers, as well. During its first full year as a newly combined company in 2020, ViacomCBS made carriage deals with Comcast, Dish, Verizon (TechCrunch’s parent), Nextstar, Meredith, Cox and Sinclair, and hashed out agreements with YouTube TV and Hulu for incremental revenues. Both YouTube TV and Hulu added over a half dozen ViacomCBS-owned channels to their respective lineups and hiked prices, as a result.Because Paramount+ is built on CBS All Access’ existing tech platform, it will have the same distribution across platforms (TV, web and mobile) as its predecessor from day one.Today, CBS All Access is estimated to have around 8 million subscribers, which makes it far smaller than other newer rivals like Disney+ (73 million+) and HBO Max (12.6 million “activated users”).Streamers, including Netflix and CBS All Access, roll out new family-friendly features']",data shared,"['CBS All Access', 'CBS All Access', 'ViacomCBS', 'CBS', 'Viacom', 'CBS', 'Nordics', 'CBS All Access', 'Nordics', 'CBS All Access', 'CBS All Access', 'NFL', 'NCAA', 'PGA', 'CIA', 'Taylor Sheridan', 'VH1’s', 'BET', 'Nickelodeon', 'BET', 'CBS', 'Comedy Central', 'MTV', 'Nickelodeon', 'Paramount Pictures', 'Dish', 'Nextstar', 'Meredith, Cox and Sinclair', 'YouTube TV', 'YouTube TV', 'Hulu', 'CBS', 'CBS All Access', 'HBO Max', 'Netflix', 'CBS All Access', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'CBS All Access', 'ViacomCBS', 'CBS', 'Viacom', 'CBS', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/6w7gubgwiZ,2021-01-19T15:34:52,Citrix is acquiring Wrike from Vista for $2.25B,"['Citrix announced today that it plans to acquire Wrike, a SaaS project management platform, from Vista Equity Partners for $2.25 billion. Vista bought the company just two years ago.Citrix, which is best known for its digital workspaces, sees this as a good match, especially at a time when employees have been forced to work from home because of the pandemic. Combining the two companies produces a powerful approach, one that didn’t escape Citrix CEO and president David Henshall.“Together, Citrix and Wrike will deliver the solutions needed to power a cloud-delivered digital workspace experience that enables teams to securely access the resources and tools they need to collaborate and get work done in the most efficient and effective way possible across any channel, device or location,” Henshall said in a statement.Andrew Filev, founder and CEO at Wrike, who has managed the company through these multiple changes and remains at the helm, believes his company has landed in a good spot with the Citrix purchase.“First, as part of the Citrix family we will be able to scale our product and accelerate our roadmap to deliver capabilities that will help our customers get more from their Wrike investment.

https://t.co/fOWQdBJKrN,2021-01-19T15:36:51,"In 2020, VCs invested $428M into US-based startups every day","['Despite a pandemic that sparked a global recession, 2020 was still a record year for venture capital investments into American startups.According to data shared by PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association, investors poured $156.2 billion into domestic startups last year, or around $428 million for each day of the year. The huge sum of money, however, was itself dwarfed by the amount of liquidity that American startups generated, some $290.1 billion.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.The exit-value figure was a record as well, as were the 321 rounds worth $100 million — nearly one for each day of the year.But while the U.S. venture capital market in 2020 was hot, it was not newly so. In 2018 and 2019, VCs invested around $140 billion into domestic startups, making last year’s $156 billion result a record, but not a shocking departure from previous years.A first read of the data indicates that the U.S. venture capital market is still getting larger in scale and later-stage in focus. But inside those well-worn trends are a host of notable movements that both underscore what we observed last year in real-time\xa0and teach us something new about today’s venture capital market.So far, 2021’s startup financing and exit market appears to be the mirror of what we saw in late 2020. So we’d best understand the past so we can forecast what we’ll see in Q1 of 2021.To avoid getting too lost in the data, we’ll proceed by stage, pulling out key facts for each step of the startup lifecycle. Feel free to scroll to the one that makes the most sense for where your company is or where your fund invests.SeedIn the U.S., seed deal count was high in 2020, around 5,227 per PitchBook’s estimates. Those rounds were worth just over $10 billion, making it the third year in a row in which American seed-stage startups managed around $10 billion in capital against around 5,000 rounds.Boring, yeah? Not really. Inside those numbers are the whole year’s ups and downs: The fact that the seed data is so close to 2018 and 2019 levels is almost silly.The real surprise from seed, per PitchBook’s report, is that these valuations actually fell on a year-over-year basis in 2020. This, despite the fact that seed deal sizes rose.Considering these two trends at once, it appears likely that, on average, VC ownership as a percentage of seed-stage companies rose in 2020.Frankly I was just surprised to see a form of startup valuation decrease after expanding for nearly a decade.']",Vise,"['Nigel Sussman', 'PitchBook', 'the National Venture Capital Association', 'Exchange', 'Exchange', 'PitchBook’s', 'PitchBook', 'VC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'CapitalpitchbookThe Exchangeventure', 'Alex Wilhelm4:36', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/sPpmfJAPJv,2021-01-19T15:23:18,WeChat advances e-commerce goals with $250B in transactions,"['WeChat continues to advance its shopping ambitions as the social networking app turns 10 years old. The Chinese messenger facilitated 1.6 trillion yuan (close to $250 billion) in annual transactions through its “mini programs,” third-party services that run on the super app that allow users to buy clothes, order food, hail taxis and more.That is double the value of transactions on WeChat’s mini programs in 2019, the networking giant announced at its annual conference for business partners and ecosystem developers, which normally takes place in its home city of Guangzhou in southern China but was moved online this year due to the pandemic.To compare, e-commerce upstart Pinduoduo, Alibaba’s archrival, saw total transactions of $214.7 billion in the third quarter.WeChat introduced mini programs in early 2017 in a move some saw as a challenge to Apple’s App Store and has over time shaped the messenger into an online infrastructure that keeps people’s lives running. It hasn’t recently disclosed how many third-party lite apps it houses, but by 2018 the number reached one million, half the size of the App Store at the time.From Tencent’s strategic perspective, the growth in mini program-based transactions helps further the company’s goal to strengthen its fintech business, which counts digital payments as a major revenue driver.A big proportion of WeChat’s mini programs are games, which the app said exceeded 500 million monthly users thanks to a boost in female and middle-aged users, as well as players residing in China’s Tier 3 cities, WeChat said.The virtual conference also unveiled a set of other milestones from China’s biggest messaging app, which surpassed 1.2 billion monthly active users last year.Among its monthly users, 500 million have tried the WeChat Search function. The Chinese internet is carved into several walled gardens controlled by titans like Tencent, Alibaba and ByteDance, which often block competitors from their services. When users search on WeChat, they are in effect retrieving information published on the messenger as well as Tencent’s allies like Sogou, Pinduoduo and Zhihu, rather than the open web.China’s search giant Baidu to set up an EV-making ventureWeChat said 240 million people have used its “payments score.” When the feature debuted back in 2019, there was speculation that it signaled WeChat’s entry into consumer credit finance and participation in the government’s social credit system. WeChat reiterated at this year’s event that the WeChat score does neither of that.Like Ant’s Sesame Score, the rating system works more like a royalty program, “designed to build trust between merchants and users.” For instance, people who reach a certain score can waive deposits or delay payments when using merchant services on WeChat. The score, WeChat said, helped users save more than $30 billion in deposits a year.WeChat’s enterprise version has surpassed 130 million active users. Its biggest rival, Dingtalk, operated by Alibaba, reached 155 million daily active users last March.The one-day event concluded with the much-anticipated appearance of Allen Zhang, WeChat’s creator. Zhang went to great lengths to talk about WeChat’s nascent short-video feature, which is somewhat similar to Snap’s Stories. He didn’t disclose the performance of short videos because “the PR team doesn’t allow” him to, but said that “if we set a goal for ourselves, we will have to achieve it.”Zhang also announced the WeChat team is weighing up an input tool for users. It’d be a tiny project given Tencent’s colossal size, but the project reflects Zhang’s belief in “privacy protection,” despite public skepticism about how WeChat handles user data.“If we analyze [users’ chat history], we can bring great advertising revenue to the company. But we don’t do that, so WeChat cares a lot about user privacy,” asserted Zhang.“But why do you still get ads [related to] what you have just said on WeChat? There are many other channels that process your information, not just WeChat. From there, our technical team said, ‘Why don’t we create an input tool ourselves?’ ”The race to be China’s top fintech platform: Ant vs Tencent']",called on their schools,"['NavigationClose', 'Allen ZhangWeChat', 'WeChat’s', 'Apple’s App Store', 'WeChat’s', 'WeChat', 'WeChat Search', 'ByteDance', 'WeChat', 'Tencent’s', 'Sogou', 'Baidu', 'EV', 'WeChat’s', 'WeChat', 'WeChat', 'Ant’s Sesame Score', 'WeChat', 'WeChat', 'WeChat’s', 'Dingtalk', 'Allen Zhang', 'WeChat’s', 'WeChat’s', 'Snap’s Stories', 'WeChat', 'Tencent’s', 'Zhang’s', 'WeChat', 'WeChat', 'Zhang', 'WeChat', 'WeChat', 'Ant vs', 'TencentclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

He actually started out as a site reliability engineer at Dropbox back in 2012, climbing the ranks to engineering director, and then senior director of Engineering – head of Infrastructure before becoming to vice president.Before Dropbox, Fong was an engineer at YouTube and Aol.Vise brought on Fong to scale up its technical team following its most recent fundraise, a $45 million in Series B led by Sequoia Capital.

He explained that he learned a lot during that eight-year period, and made a lot of mistakes, and was eager to see how that knowledge could be reapplied at a different firm.“What would it be like to do this again with the knowledge I have now?” asked Fong. “What things would I do differently? How would I improve upon it? How can I actually take that knowledge and leverage it in a way that helps others in the industry or my peers at Vise? Can I provide a perspective that they don’t necessarily have today?”Fong was first connected with Vise while he was still at Dropbox. He spoke to Vise co-founder Runik Mehrotra on an explanatory call, and remembers feeling like no matter where his path took him, he wanted to stay connected to Mehrotra and Vise.“This is somebody that just has something about him,” he said of Mehrotra. “There’s just like an ‘it’ factor that made me feel like I wanted to work with him.”Fong says that recruiting during COVID, with extremely limited face-to-face contact, is one of the biggest challenges ahead for both himself and Vise in general.Trillions are at stake in the retirement wars, and Vise nets $14.5M from Sequoia to manage it']",expensive,"['Andrew Fong', 'CTO', 'Andrew Fong', 'Andrew Fong', 'Fong', 'Dropbox', 'Dropbox', 'Dropbox', 'Fong', 'YouTube', 'Aol', 'Fong', 'Sequoia Capital', 'Meet Vise AI', 'AI', 'Fong', 'Fong', 'Fong', 'DEI', 'DEI', 'Dropbox', 'Fong', 'Fong', 'Dropbox', 'Runik Mehrotra', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Andrew Fong', 'CTOJordan Crook4:00', 'Andrew Fong', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/q3iwH3UIuK,2021-01-19T14:32:35,Senator: ‘More transparency is needed’ by exam proctoring tech firms,"['Three of the leading exam proctoring companies are facing calls to be more transparent, amid continued claims of bias by students forced to take remote exams because of the ongoing pandemic.Exam proctoring tech lets students take remotely invigilated tests from home. Students are told to install their university’s choice of proctoring software, which allows the exam monitor deep access to the student’s computer, including their webcams and microphones, to monitor their activity to spot potential cheating.But companies like Proctorio, ExamSoft and ProctorU have faced a barrage of criticism from students who say that their proctoring technology is fraught with problems, including issues of bias — all of which could impact their test results.Chief among the complaints are that their proctoring software cannot recognize faces with darker skin tones or religious headgear, and discriminates against students with disabilities and those in lower-income areas who may not have the internet speeds to meet the standards of the test-taking tech.Several U.S. Democratic senators sent Proctorio, ExamSoft and ProctorU letters in December calling on the companies to explain their technology and policies better. In their responses seen by TechCrunch, the companies rejected claims of discrimination and all said that it’s up to the teachers to decide whether a student has cheated, not the companies themselves.But lawmakers say that the companies are not transparent enough, and worry teachers could be making decisions about a student’s conduct based on little more than what the technology tells them.“Proctorio, ExamSoft and ProctorU claim they don’t have problems with bias, yet alarming reports from students tell a different story,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told TechCrunch. “These responses from the companies are only the first step in learning more about how they operate, but much more transparency is needed into the systems that have the power to accuse students of cheating. I will work on every fix necessary to ensure students are protected.”Students across the U.S. have already called on their schools to stop using proctoring software citing privacy and security risks.We sent the companies several questions.

StackPulse, a new startup that wants to help developers manage these crisis situations more efficiently, emerged from stealth today with a $28 million investment.The round actually breaks down to a previously unannounced $8 million seed investment and a new $20 million Series A. GGV led the A round, while Bessemer Venture Partners led the seed and also participated in the A. Glenn Solomon at GGV and Amit Karp at Bessemer will join the StackPulse board.Nobody is immune to these outages. We’ve seen incidents from companies as varied as Amazon and Slack in recent months. The biggest companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon employ site reliability engineers and build customized platforms to help remediate these kinds of situations. StackPulse hopes to put this kind of capability within reach of companies, whose only defense is the on-call developers.Company co-founder and CEO Ofer Smadari says that in the midst of a crisis with signals coming at you from Slack and PagerDuty and other sources, it’s hard to figure out what’s happening. StackPulse is designed to help sort out the details to get you back to equilibrium as quickly as possible.FireHydrant  lands $8M Series A for disaster management toolFirst off, it helps identify the severity of the incident. Is it a false alarm or something that requires your team’s immediate attention or something that can be put off for a later maintenance cycle? If there is something going wrong that needs to be fixed right now, StackPulse can not only identify the source of the problem, but also help fix it automatically, Smadari explained.After the incident has been resolved, it can also help with a post-mortem to figure out what exactly went wrong by pulling in all of the alert communications and incident data into the platform.As the company emerges from stealth, it has some early customers, and 35 employees based in Portland, Oregon and Tel Aviv. Smadari says that he hopes to have 100 employees by the end of this year. As he builds the organization, he is thinking about how to build a diverse team for a diverse customer base. He believes that people with diverse backgrounds build a better product. He adds that diversity is a top level goal for the company, which already has an HR leader in place to help.Glenn Solomon from GGV, who will be joining the company board, saw a strong founding team solving a big problem for companies and wanted to invest. “When they described the vision for the product they wanted to build, it made sense to us,” he said.Customers are impatient with down time and Solomon sees developers on the front line trying to solve these issues. “Performance is more important than ever.

Index Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which first invested in the company in its $16 million Series A in 2020, also participated.Valuation is not being disclosed, but for what it’s worth, the round was one that generated a lot of interest. In between getting pitched this story and publishing it, the size of the Series B grew by $8 million (it was originally closed at $36 million).

Co-founder Euan Blair (who happens to be the son of the former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his accomplished barrister wife Cherie Booth Blair) said the original name was a reference to how the startup sought to “hack the system for good.”However, he added, “The scale has become bigger and more evolved.” As in gaming — which is probably the arena where you might have heard this term before — the new name is to convey that “anything is possible.”There are “multiple universes” one can inhabit as a post-18 young adult, Blair continued. And while it’s been assumed that to get into tech, the obvious route was a two-to-four year (and often more) tour through college or university to pick up a higher education degree, the bet that Multiverse is making here is that apprenticeships can easily, and widely, become another. “We want to build an outstanding alternative to university and college,” he said. These typically last 1.5 years.\xa0The idea of an “outstanding alternative” is especially important when thinking of how to aim opportunities and encourage people from more marginalized groups to connect with them, and specifically how this ties up with how tech companies are looking to be more diverse with hiring talent in the future. In both cases, the ideal is that pursuing either of those goals should not be at the expense of the quality, both in terms of what people are getting out of experiences, or the resulting talent that is getting recruited. There’s long been a stigma attached to less prestigious institutions, so putting money or effort into another channel to perpetuate that doesn’t really make sense or point to progress, which is why the idea of building high quality apprenticeships are a disruptive, and also compelling, idea.Blair said that currently over half of the people making their way through Multiverse are people of color, and 57% are women, and the plan is to build tools to make that an even firmer part of its mission.\xa0The startup sees itself as part tech company and part education enterprise.It works with tech companies and others to open up opportunities for people who have not had any higher education or any training, where fresh high school graduates can come in, learn the ropes of a job while getting paid and then continue on working their way up the ladder with that knowledge base in place.Apprenticeships on the platform right now range from data analysts through to exhibition designers. The idea is that by opening up and targeting the U.S. market, the breadth, number and location of roles will grow.This is not just a social enterprise: there is actual money here. Blair said that prices it charges the companies it works with range by qualification, “but are broadly around the $15,000 mark.” (The individuals applying don’t pay anything, and they will also be paid by the companies providing the apprenticeships.)On the educational front, Multiverse doesn’t just connect people as a recruiter might: it has a team in place to build out what the “curriculum” might be for a particular apprenticeship, and how to deliver and train people with the requisite skills alongside the practice experience of working, and more.That latter role, of course, has taken on a more poignant dimension in the last year: Concepts like remote training and virtual mentorship have very much come into their own at a time when offices are largely standing empty to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.Regardless of what happens in the year ahead — fingers crossed that vaccinations and other efforts will help us collectively move past where we are right now — many believe that the infrastructure that has been put into place to keep working virtually will continue to be used, which bodes well for a company like Multiverse that is building a business around that, both with technology it creates itself and will bring in from third parties and partners.Indeed, the ecosystem of companies building tools to deliver educational content, provide training and work collaboratively has really boomed in the pandemic, giving companies like Multiverse a large library of options for how to bring people into new work situations. (Google, which is now an investor in Multiverse, is very much one of the makers of such educational tools.)Apprenticeships, meanwhile, are an interesting area for a startup to tackle. Traditionally, it’s a term that would have been associated mainly with skilled labor positions, rather than “knowledge workers.”But with the bigger swing that the globe has seen away from industrial and towards knowledge economies, there is an argument to be made for building more enterprises and opportunities for an ever-wider application of concepts like apprenticeships, rather than expecting everyone to be shoehorned into the models of the last 50 years.(The latter essentially implies that college is possibly the only way up.)It might be fair to claim that Blair’s connections helped him secure funding and open doors with would-be customers. That might well be the case, but ultimately the startup will live or die by how well it executes on its premise, whether it finds a good way to connect more people, engage them in opportunities and keep them on board.And this is what really attracted the investors, said Joel Cutler, managing director and co-founder of General Catalyst.“Euan has a genuine belief that this is important, and when you talk to him, you get a\xa0 feeling of manifest destiny,” Cutler said in an interview. In response to the question of family connections, he said that this was precisely the kind of issue that the technology industry should be tackling to fight.“Of all the industries to break the mold of where you went to school, it should be the tech world that will do that, since it is far more of a meritocracy than others. This is the perfect place to start to break that mold,” he said. “Education will be super valuable but apprenticeships will also be important.”He noted that another company that General Catalyst invests in, Guild Education, is addressing similar opportunities, or rather the gaps in current opportunities, for older people.']",Conversa Health,"['WhiteHat', 'Multiverse', 'NavigationClose', 'WhiteHat', 'Multiverse', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Maskot / Getty ImagesUniversity', 'Multiverse', 'General Catalyst', 'Bloom & Wild', 'Google Ventures', 'Audacious Ventures, Latitude', 'SemperVirens', 'Venture Partners', 'Bloom & Wild', 'EuropeThe', 'WhiteHat', 'Euan Blair', 'Tony Blair', 'Cherie Booth Blair', 'Blair', 'Multiverse', 'Blair', 'Multiverse', 'Blair', 'Multiverse', 'Multiverse', 'Multiverse', 'Blair’s', 'Joel Cutler', 'General Catalyst', 'General Catalyst', 'Guild Education', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'WhiteHat', 'Multiverse', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Under the long-term strategic partnership, Cruise will use Azure, Microsoft’s cloud and edge computing platform, for its yet-to-be launched autonomous vehicle ride-hailing service.Any autonomous vehicle company aiming to commercialize — meaning bring their tech to the public at scale — needs a robust cloud computing platform. Operating fleets of self-driving vehicles that will shuttle people and even packages generates a massive amount of data, making cloud services one of the bigger costs for an AV company.Cruise’s partnership with Microsoft aims to provide benefits for both companies. Cruise will be able to lock in lower prices for cloud services and Microsoft will be able to test some of its bleeding-edge systems that can handle workloads needed to bring machine learning and robotics — like autonomous vehicles — to life and at scale.“Advances in digital technology are redefining every aspect of our work and life, including how we move people and goods,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “As Cruise and GM’s preferred cloud, we will apply the power of Azure to help them scale and make autonomous transportation mainstream.”The partnership extends to GM as well, according to Tuesday’s announcement. Microsoft will be GM’s preferred public cloud provider to help the automaker accelerate several of it digitization initiatives as well as streamline operations across digital supply chains.The partnership will not only allow Cruise to accelerate the commercialization of its all-electric, self-driving vehicles, it helps “GM realize even more benefits from cloud computing as we launch 30 new electric vehicles globally by 2025 and create new businesses and services to drive growth, GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra said.Cruise taps former Delta executive for COO post as it creeps toward commercialization']",K Health,"['Microsoft', 'NavigationClose', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'CruiseCruise', 'Microsoft', 'GM', 'Honda', 'Cruise', 'Microsoft’s', 'Cruise', 'Cruise', 'Microsoft’s', 'Microsoft', 'Microsoft', 'Microsoft', 'Satya Nadella', 'Cruise', 'GM', 'GM', 'Microsoft', 'GM', 'GM', 'GM', 'Mary Barra', 'Delta', 'COO', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Microsoft', 'GM', 'Honda', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/SHmDrBdxqf,2021-01-19T14:00:52,ETH spin-off LatticeFlow raises $2.8M to help build trustworthy AI systems,"['LatticeFlow, an AI startup that was spun out of ETH Zurich in 2020, today announced that it has raised a $2.8 million seed funding round led by Swiss deep-tech fund btov and Global Founders Capital, which previously backed the likes of Revolut, Slack and Zalando.The general idea behind LatticeFlow is to build tools that help AI teams build and deploy AI models that are safe, reliable and trustworthy. The problem today, the team argues, is that models get very good at finding the right statistical patterns to hit a given benchmark. That makes them inflexible, though, since these models were optimized for accuracy in a lab setting, not for robustness in the real world.“One of the most commonly used paradigms for evaluating machine learning models is just aggregate metrics, like accuracy. And, of course, this is a super coarse representation of how good a model really is,” Pavol Bielik, the company’s CTO explained. “What we want to do is, we provide systematic ways of monitoring models, assessing their reliability across different relevant data slices and then also provide tools for improving these models.”Image Credits: LatticeFlowBuilding these kinds of models that are more flexible yet still provide robust results will take a new arsenal of tools, though, as well as the right team with deep expertise in these areas. Clearly, though, this is a founding team with the right background. In addition to CTO Bielik, the founding team includes Petar Tsankov, the company’s CEO and former senior researcher and lecturer at ETH Zurich, as well as ETH professors Martin Vechev, who leads the Secure, Reliable and Intelligence Systems lab at ETH, and Andreas Krause, who leads ETH’s Learning & Adaptive Systems lab.Snyk bags another $200M at $2.6B valuation 9 months after last raiseIt’s also worth noting that Vechev, who previously co-founded ETH spin-off ChainSecurity, and his group at ETH previously developed ERAN, a verifier for large deep learning models with millions of parameters, that last year won the first competition for certifying deep neural networks. While the team was already looking at creating a company before winning this competition, Vechev noted that gave the team the confirmation that it was on the right path.Image Credits: LatticeFlow“We want to solve the main AI problem, which is making AI usable. This is the overarching goal,” Vechev told me. “[…] I don’t think you can actually found the company just purely based on the certification work. I think the kinds of skills that people have in the company, my group, Andreas [Krause]’s group, they all complement each other and cover a huge space, which I think is very, very unique. I don’t know of other companies who have covered this range of skills in these pressing points and have done groundbreaking work before.”LatticeWorks already has a set of pilot customers who are trialing its tools. These include Swiss railways (SBB), which is using it to build a tool for automatic rail inspections, Germany’s Federal Cyber Security Bureau and the U.S. Army. The team is also working with other large enterprises that are using its tools to improve their computer vision models.“Machine Learning (ML) is one of the core topics at SBB, as we see a huge potential in its application for an improved, intelligent and automated monitoring of our railway infrastructure,” said Dr. Ilir Fetai and Andre Roger, the leads of SBB’s AI team. “The project on robust and reliable AI with LatticeFlow, ETH, and Siemens has a crucial role in enabling us to fully exploit the advantages of using ML.”For now, LatticeFlow remains in early access. The team plans to use the funding to accelerate its product development and bring on new customers. The team also plans to build out a presence in the U.S. in the near future.']",PPRO,"['ETH', 'LatticeFlow', 'AI', 'LatticeFlow', 'AI', 'AI', 'ETH Zurich', 'Global Founders Capital', 'Revolut', 'LatticeFlow', 'AI', 'Pavol Bielik', 'CTO', 'CTO Bielik', 'ETH Zurich', 'ETH', 'Martin Vechev', 'Intelligence Systems', 'ETH', 'Andreas Krause', 'ETH’s Learning & Adaptive Systems', 'Snyk', 'Vechev', 'ETH', 'ChainSecurity', 'ETH', 'ERAN', 'Vechev', 'AI', 'AI', 'Andreas', 'SBB', 'Federal Cyber Security Bureau', 'the U.S. Army', 'SBB', 'Ilir Fetai', 'Andre Roger', 'SBB', 'AI', 'LatticeFlow', 'ETH', 'Siemens', 'LatticeFlow', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Partnersdeep', 'LatticeFlow', 'AI', 'Lardinois3:00 PM', 'AI', 'ETH Zurich', 'Global Founders Capital', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Ix0wWIrTCm,2021-01-19T14:00:49,Conversa Health expands its Series B round to $20M,"['Portland, Oregon-based Conversa Health, a virtual care and communication platform that helps health organizations stay in touch with their patients and customers, today announced that it has expanded its Series B funding round from $12 million to $20 million. The round is still co-led by Builders VC and Northwell Health’s venture arm Northwell Ventures. Additional investors include UH Ventures, the venture arm of University Hospitals and VC firms P5\xa0Health Ventures, Epic Ventures, StartUp Health and Nassau Street Ventures, as well Genesis Merchant Capital and J-Ventures, which came in as new investors in this expanded round.“There’s been a recognition, especially with COVID, that the need for automated and virtual — which are two big trends in healthcare — were on the horizon but now the horizon has been pulled in because of COVID and the healthcare system recognizes that that’s going to be required to be able to allow access for patients and improve both the experience for patients and providers, and get better outcomes and do it at lower cost,” Conversa CEO Murray Brozinsky told me.Brozinsky actually believes that within the next decade, 80% of care will be done remotely. This will allow for more personalized and evidence-based care, but it will also require investments in automation.“Conversa links providers’ EHRs and other patient data to best-of-breed interactive digital care pathways and clinical analytics engine to automate care management 24×7. This improves care plan adherence pre and post visit, reducing costs and generating better outcomes for patients,” said Builders VC partner and Conversa board member Mark Goldstein. “Conversa’s enterprise platform and library of digital pathways are used by providers to care for patients across their populations, as opposed to one-off point solutions. It fills an enormous gap in the market.”Conversa Health raises $12M Series B for its digital health platformGiven the pandemic, it’s maybe no surprise that Conversa’s business also boomed. The number of customers the company its services has grown fourfold while its financial metrics are up 6x because a lot of its larger companies have expanded their use of the platform.The team decided to expand the existing Series B round to help it capitalize on this momentum and to bring on more engineers in order to scale the platform. Brozinsky believes that the need for a platform like Conversa’s will remain after the pandemic ends. In addition, the company is also already rolling out support for vaccination programs in its service to help educate consumers but also help in monitoring efforts after people get their shots.“Everything we’re hearing from health systems, they recognize that they need to be prepared for this to happen again, they still need to care for the core demographics that haven’t changed — this aging population — with an acute shortage of healthcare workers,” Brozinsky said. “So the need for the systems and these platforms is going to be more acute and the investment is not so much an additional cost but an enormous return.”']",survey,"['Conversa Health', 'NavigationClose ScreenConversa Health', 'Charlie Ma', 'Conversa Health', 'Builders VC', 'Northwell Health’s', 'Northwell Ventures', 'UH Ventures', 'University Hospitals', 'VC', 'P5\xa0Health Ventures', 'Epic Ventures', 'StartUp Health and', 'Nassau Street Ventures', 'Genesis Merchant Capital', 'J-Ventures', 'Murray Brozinsky', 'Brozinsky', 'Builders VC', 'Conversa', 'Mark Goldstein', 'Conversa', 'Brozinsky', 'Brozinsky', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'FundingStartupsboard', 'vcConversa', 'Conversa Health', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/WQaTs17rtj,2021-01-19T13:05:01,K Health expands into virtual childcare and raises $132 million at a $1.5 billion valuation,"['K Health, the virtual healthcare provider that uses machine learning to lower the cost of care by providing the bulk of the company’s health assessments, is launching new tools for childcare on the heels of raising cash that values the company at $1.5 billion.The $132 million round raised in December will help the company expand and help pay for upgrades, including an integration with most electronic health records — an integration that’s expected by the second quarter.Throughout 2020 K Health has leveraged its position operating at the intersection of machine learning and consumer healthcare to raise $222 million in a single year.This appetite from investors shows how large the opportunity is in consumer healthcare as companies look to use technology to make care more affordable.For K Health, that means a monthly subscription to its service of $9 for unlimited access to the service and physicians on the platform, as well as a $19 per-month virtual mental health offering and a $19 fee for a one-time urgent care consultation.To patients and investors the pitch is that the data K Health has managed to acquire through partnerships with organizations like the Israel health maintenance organization Maccabi Healthcare Services, which gave up decades of anonymized data on patients and health outcomes to train K Health’s predictive algorithm, can assess patients and aid the in diagnoses for the company’s doctors.In theory that means the company’s service essentially acts as a virtual primary care physician, holding a wealth of patient information that, when taken together, might be able to spot underlying medical conditions faster or provide a more holistic view into patient care.For pharmaceutical companies that could mean insights into population health that could be potentially profitable avenues for drug discovery.In practice, patients get what they pay for.The company’s mental health offering uses medical doctors who are not licensed psychiatrists to perform their evaluations and assessments, according to one provider on the platform, which can lead to interactions with untrained physicians that can cause more harm than good.While company chief executive Allon Bloch is likely correct in his assessment that most services can be performed remotely (Bloch puts the figure at 90%), they should be performed remotely by professionals who have the necessary training.There are limits to how much heavy lifting an algorithm or a generalist should do when it comes to healthcare, and it appears that K Health wants to push those limits.“Drug referrals, acute issues, prevention issues, most of those can be done remotely,” Bloch said. “There’s an opportunity to do much better and potentially cheaper.\xa0K Health has already seen hundreds of thousands of patients either through its urgent care offering or its subscription service and generated tens of millions in revenue in 2020, according to Bloch. He declined to disclose how many patients used the urgent care service versus the monthly subscription offering.Telemedicine companies, like other companies providing services remotely, have thrived during the pandemic. Teladoc and Amwell, two of the early pioneers in virtual medicine, have seen their share prices soar.Backing K Health are a group of investors led by GGV Capital and Valor Equity Partners. Kaiser Permanente’s pension fund and the investment offices of the owners of 3G Capital (the Brazilian investment firm that owns Burger King and Kraft Heinz), along with 14W, Max Ventures, Pico Partners, Marcy Venture Partners, Primary Venture Partners and BoxGroup also participated in the round.\xa0Organizations working with the company include Maccabi Healthcare; the Mayo Clinic, which is investigating virtual care models with the company; and Anthem, which has white-labeled the K Health service and provides it to some of the insurer’s millions of members.']",Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014,"['K Health', 'NavigationClose', 'Busakorn Pongparnit', '2020 K Health', 'K Health', 'K Health', 'Maccabi Healthcare Services', 'K Health’s', 'Allon Bloch', 'Bloch', 'K Health', 'Bloch', 'K Health', 'Bloch', 'Amwell', 'Backing K Health', 'GGV Capital', 'Kaiser Permanente’s', 'Burger King', 'Kraft Heinz', 'Max Ventures', 'Pico Partners', 'Marcy Venture Partners', 'Primary Venture Partners', 'BoxGroup', 'Maccabi Healthcare', 'the Mayo Clinic', 'the K Health', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Kingdrug', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/x6R7l8DwKF,2021-01-19T12:15:45,PPRO nabs $180M at a $1B+ valuation to bring together the fragmented world of payments,"['The pandemic has hastened a shift of most commerce becoming e-commerce in the last year, and that has brought a new focus on startups that are helping to enable that process.In the latest development, PPRO, a London-based startup that has built a platform to make it easier for marketplaces, payment providers and other e-commerce players to enable localised payments — that is, make and take payments in whatever form local customers prefer to use, which extend well beyond basic payment cards — has closed a round of $180 million, funding that catapults PPRO’s valuation to over $1 billion.PPRO (pronounced “P-pro”, as in payments professionals) plans to use the funding to continue expanding in newer markets.Simon Black, PPRO’s CEO, said in an interview that two particular areas of focus in the coming year will be more activity in Asian countries like Singapore and Indonesia, as well as Latin America, where the company acquired a local player, allpago, back in 2019.In both cases, the opportunity comes in the form of high growth stemming from more transactions moving online, as well as the chaos that is the fragmented payments market.The capital is coming from a group of investors that includes Eurazeo Growth, Sprints Capital and Wellington Management. It comes on the heels of a $50 million round the company raised last August from Sprints, along with Citi and HPE Growth; and a further $50 million it picked up in 2018 led by strategic investor PayPal.PayPal leads $50M round for PPRO, a profitable cross-border payment specialistPayPal, alongside Citi, Mastercard Payment Gateway Services, Mollie and Worldpay are among PPRO’s 100 large global customers, which use the company’s APIs for a variety of functions, including localised gateway, processing and merchant acquirer services.The flood of activity coming from consumers and businesses buying more online — a by-product of the pandemic leading to many businesses shutting down physical operations for the moment — has seen the company double transaction volumes between Q4 2020 and the same quarter in 2019.PPRO is not the only company to be targeting that opportunity.There is a fundamental fragmentation in financial services overall. Realistically, there are only a few types of basic transactions that might be made — usually: deposits, payments, credit — but quite literally thousands of permutations and methods to make them, with specific markets and their populations typically coalescing around their own localized selections among these.That has led to the rise of a number of companies providing what has come to be called “banking as a service” or “fintech as a service,” where a tech provider stitches together in the background a number of services, sometimes thousands, and makes it easier for their customers, by way of an API, to plug in those services for their own customers to use more easily, most often connected to a range of other services provided to them like money management.Others in this wider space that includes payments and other fintech services include the likes of Rapyd, Mambu, Thought Machine, Temenos, Edera, Adyen, Stripe and newer players like Unit, with many of these raising large amounts of money in recent times in particular to double down on what is currently a rapidly expanding market.Unit raises $18.6M to offer banking features as a serviceThe unique aspect of PPRO is that it was an early mover in the area of identifying the conundrum of fragmentation in payments for companies that operate in more than one country or region, and that it has continued to play only in payments, without a jump to adjacent services.“We’re ultra focused because the local payments problem is actually growing,” said Black, who believes that “the disconnect between what a consumer wants to use, but also their appetite and the proliferation of payment options” all contribute to more complexity (with the trade-off being more choices for consumers, but equally possibly too much choice?).As Black sees it, the company’s focus on payments has given it more momentum to build better tech specifically to address that globally.“PPRO is building solutions for performance in industrial strength. It’s growing rapidly because there are no other players that are truly global. We are globalizing to support the needs of customers who want to nationalize, so we have an opportunity to focus on payments, to be a strategic outsource partner.”This doesn’t mean that there isn’t room for product expansion: alongside payments, Black highlighted product compliance and providing better analytics as two areas where the company is already active and will be doing more for customers.“Where we partner and provide value is in anticipating changes in consumer demand,” he noted. “We monitor how customers are using those methods and — whether you are a service provider or furniture or travel company — determine which are the best relevant payment methods.” Services like open banking, tools for banks to enable allowing payments directly from customers’ accounts, or buy-now-pay-later payments, are examples, he said, of areas that speak of further opportunities.Mambu raises $135M at a $2B+ valuation for a SaaS platform that powers banking services“We are delighted to support Simon and the team at PPRO as they continue to develop best-in-class local payment solutions,” commented Nathalie Kornhoff-Brüls, managing director at Eurazeo Growth, in a statement. “All signs for the future indicate that digital commerce, and even more so cross-border commerce, will continue to grow exponentially while innovation in payment methods remains strong. As a result, facilitating local payments is becoming increasingly complex. Payment service providers, however, no longer have a choice as merchants and their customers are pushing for the adoption.”“PPRO has proven to be the go-to problem solver in this area, providing the local payments technology and expertise that the world’s biggest payment players rely on. Our investment reflects our confidence in the growth potential for PPRO and we’re excited to support PPRO and its team on their journey,” added Voria Fattahi, a partner at Sprints Capital, in a separate statement.']",sale of its LatAm ops to food-delivery focused rival Delivery Hero for $272 million,"['NavigationClose', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'iStock / Getty ImagesThe', 'PPRO', 'Simon Black', 'PPRO’s', 'Eurazeo Growth, Sprints Capital', 'Wellington Management', 'Sprints', 'Citi', 'HPE Growth', 'PayPal', 'PayPal', 'PPRO', 'Citi', 'Mastercard Payment Gateway Services', 'Mollie', 'Worldpay', 'Edera', 'PPRO', 'Black', 'Mambu', 'services“We', 'PPRO', 'Nathalie Kornhoff-Brüls', 'Eurazeo Growth', 'PPRO', 'PPRO', 'Voria Fattahi', 'Sprints Capital', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'GrowthpaymentspproSprints Capitalwellington managementPPRO', 'Lunden1:15', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/B24ZE05gx8,2021-01-19T11:28:09,India asks WhatsApp to withdraw new privacy policy over ‘grave concerns’,"['India has asked WhatsApp to withdraw the planned change to its privacy policy, posing a new headache to the Facebook-owned service that identifies the South Asian nation as its biggest market by users.In an email to WhatsApp head Will Cathcart, the nation’s IT ministry said the upcoming update to the app’s data-sharing policy has raised “grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens… Therefore, you are called upon to withdraw the proposed changes.”The ministry is additionally seeking clarification from WhatsApp on its data-sharing agreement with Facebook and other commercial firms and has asked why users in the EU are exempt from the new privacy policy but their counterpoint in India have no choice but to comply.“Such a differential treatment is prejudicial to the interests of Indian users and is viewed with serious concern by the government,” the ministry wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by TechCrunch. “The government of India owes a sovereign responsibility to its citizens to ensure that their interests are not compromised and therefore it calls upon WhatsApp to respond to concerns raised in this letter.”Through an in-app alert earlier this month, WhatsApp had asked users to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share with Facebook some personal data about them, such as their phone number and location. Users were initially provided until February 8 to comply with the new policy if they wished to continue using the service.“This ‘all-or-nothing’ approach takes away any meaningful choice from Indian users. This approach leverages the social significance of WhatsApp to force users into a bargain, which may infringe on their interests in relation to informational privacy and information security,” the ministry said in the email.An advertisement from WhatsApp is seen in a newspaper at a stall in New Delhi on January 13, 2021. (Photo by Sajjad HUSSAIN / AFP) (Photo by SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP via Getty Images)The notification from WhatsApp prompted a lot of confusion — and in some cases, anger and frustration — among its users, many of which have explored alternative messaging apps such as Telegram and Signal in recent weeks.In a statement on Tuesday, a WhatsApp spokesperson said, “We wish to reinforce that this update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook. Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses so they can serve their customers and grow. WhatsApp will always protect personal messages with end-to-end encryption so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see them. We are working to address misinformation and remain available to answer any questions.”WhatsApp, which\xa0Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014, has been sharing some limited information about its users\xa0with the social giant since 2016 — and for a period allowed users to opt-out of this. Responding to the backlash last week, the Facebook-owned app, which serves more than 2 billion users worldwide, said it was deferring the enforcement of the planned policy to May 15.WhatsApp delays enforcement of privacy terms by 3 months, following backlashWhatsApp also ran front-page ads on several newspapers in India last week, where it has amassed over 450 million users, to explain the changes and debunk some rumors.New Delhi also shared disappointment with the timing of this update, which, to be fair, WhatsApp unveiled last year. The ministry said that it was reviewing the Personal Data Protection Bill, a monumental privacy bill that is meant to oversee how data of users are shared with the world.“Since the Parliament is seized of the issue, making such a momentous change for Indian users at this time puts the cart before the horse. Since the Personal Data Protection Bill strongly follows the principle of ‘purpose limitation,’ these changes may lead to significant implementational challenges for WhatsApp should the Bill become an Act,” the letter said.On Tuesday, India’s IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also offered loud advice to Facebook. “Be it WhatsApp, be it Facebook, be it any digital platform. You are free to do business in India but do it in a manner without impinging upon the rights of Indians who operate there.” Be it WhatsApp, Facebook or any other digital platform they are free to do business in India but it should be done in a manner without impinging upon the rights of Indians who operate it.

https://t.co/IRsp5NIb0L,2021-01-19T10:30:52,Spain’s Glovo inks real estate tie-up to add more dark stores for speedy urban delivery,"['Spain’s Glovo, an on-demand delivery app, has announced a strategic partnership with Swiss-based real estate firm, Stoneweg.The deal will see the latter invest €100 million in building and refurbishing “prime city real estate” in some of Glovo’s key markets as the delivery app works to build out its network of dark stores and sign up more retail partners for its urban delivery service, it said today.The initial focus for the partnership will be on growing its dark stores network in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Romania, with additional countries slated as under review in Europe.“These are the countries in which both Glovo and Stoneweg have a major presence, and therefore are able to move much quicker when it comes to setting up,” a Glovo spokeswoman told us. “However, the deal is not limited to these countries. Glovo’s aim is to grow and strengthen their Q-Commerce and dark kitchens infrastructure across Eastern Europe too.”Glovo currently operates 18 dark stores globally — in cities including Barcelona, Madrid, Lisbon and Milan — but said it’s now looking to open similar stores in Valencia, Rome, Porto and Bucharest, among others.It wants to have 100 dark stores up and running by the end of 2021, it added.Last September the startup announced the sale of its LatAm ops to food-delivery focused rival Delivery Hero for $272 million\xa0— leaving it more fully focused on Southern and Eastern Europe.Then in November it announced the launch of a dedicated business unit to support expansion of the sub-30 minute urban delivery service, which it calls “Q-Commerce” (that’s “Q” for quick) — saying it would accelerate development of a B2B offering to stock third parties’ products in its city center warehouses (and have them delivered to shoppers via the couriers doing gig work on its platform).Glovo said today that the Stoneweg strategic partnership will help it step on the gas to grow the infrastructure and fulfilment centers it needs to underpin this B2B offering.On-demand delivery app Glovo is spinning up a B2B logistics unit for super speedy urban deliveryThe “deliver anything” app is spying an opportunity to capitalize on the coronavirus’ impact on traditional bricks-and-mortar retail — betting urban consumers will make a permanent shift to outsourcing grocery and other convenience/essential shops to an app which bundles high speed delivery, rather than making such trips in person.Its dialled-up focus on Q-Commerce is a direct response to “changing consumer sentiment and demand for instant and same-day delivery”, it added.To date, Glovo’s platform has delivered more than 12 million multi-category orders globally, while in 2020 it experienced a growth rate of more than 300% year-on-year.As well as supermarkets such as Carrefour, Continente, and Kaufland, Glovo’s list of retail partners includes the likes of Unilever, Nestle and L’Oréal, and IKEA — so it’s by no means focused purely on groceries.It has said it wants Q-Commerce to power delivery of a wide range of products — from toys, music, books, flowers and beauty products to pharmacy items and groceries. And even, in some markets, a curated selected of IKEA wares — i.e. stuff that’s small enough to fit in couriers’ backpacks.Commenting on the Stoneweg strategic investment in a statement, Oscar Pierre, co-founder and CEO, said: “We believe that the third-generation of commerce is already upon us. Following the close of Stoneweg’s investment, we are consolidating our strategic commitment to Q-Commerce, which will allow us to better connect people with a wide variety of available products in their cities.“In the wake of COVID-19, we believe that dark stores represent the future of post-pandemic retail, and I think we’ll see a permanent shift in consumer habits towards same-day and instant delivery. We’re excited to continue to expand our offering, so that all types of businesses, from local independent stores to multi-national chains, can reach more and more customers thanks to new technological solutions and highly efficient infrastructure.”In another supporting statement, Stoneweg’s Joaquín Castellví, founding partner and head of acquisitions for Europe, added that the strategic investment represents “an opportunity to offer our clients to diversify into a new class of retail asset through consolidated cities where Glovo operates — in a segment with great growth potential, accelerated by the situation we are experiencing”.Spain’s Glovo grabs $166M Series E for its ‘deliver anything’ appGlovo’s push to take a margin on a broad range of urban retail comes at a time when consolidation is eating into the thin margin food delivery space.It is also facing legal challenges to its business model in Europe over the classification of couriers as self-employed — losing a supreme court ruling in its home market last September.Ministers in Spain are working on a new regulatory framework for delivery apps and Glovo has said it’s awaiting that reform before making any changes but a lot will be riding on the detail.UK-based Deliveroo also recently lost a legal challenge in Spain over the classification of its couriers. A court in Barcelona found last week that the company had falsely defined 748 riders as self employed, following a 2018 workplace inspection.The delivery platform which competes with Glovo in the on-demand food and grocery space, announced Sunday the closing of a Series H funding round — raising $180M+ from existing investors, led by Durable Capital Partners LP and Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, which it said valued the business at over $7BN.The investment would enable Deliveroo to continue investing in “developing the best proposition for consumers, riders and restaurants”, it said, noting that it would be expanding in on-demand grocery following “rapid” growth over the last year.Deliveroo added that the Series H investment comes ahead of a “potential” IPO — and said it “reflects strong demand from existing shareholders to invest in the company, given the significant growth potential in the online food delivery sector in which consumer adoption is accelerating”.Europe’s Deliveroo and Glovo switch on contactless delivery during COVID-19 pandemic']",Alan,"['NavigationClose ScreenSpain’s', 'Lomas@riptari', 'GlovoSpain’s Glovo', 'Stoneweg', 'Glovo’s', 'Glovo', 'Stoneweg', 'Glovo', 'Glovo’s', 'Q-Commerce', 'Porto', 'Bucharest', 'Delivery Hero', 'Stoneweg', 'Glovo', 'Q-Commerce', 'Glovo’s', 'Continente', 'Glovo’s', 'Unilever', 'Nestle', 'IKEA', 'Q-Commerce', 'IKEA', 'Stoneweg', 'Oscar Pierre', 'Stoneweg’s', 'Q-Commerce', 'COVID-19', 'Stoneweg', 'Joaquín Castellví', 'Glovo', 'Glovo', 'Glovo', 'Deliveroo', 'Glovo', 'Durable Capital Partners LP', 'Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC', 'Glovo', 'COVID-19', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Stoneweg', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/SJwq38KerC,2021-01-19T10:00:53,"Qualcomm-backed chipmaker Kneron nails Foxconn funding, deal","['A startup based out of San Diego and Taipei is quietly nailing fundings and deals from some of the biggest names in electronics. Kneron, which specializes in energy-efficient processors for edge artificial intelligence, just raised a strategic funding round from Taiwan’s manufacturing giant Foxconn and integrated circuit producer Winbond.The deal came a year after Kneron closed a $40 million round led by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing’s Horizons Ventures. Amongst its other prominent investors are Alibaba Entrepreneurship Fund, Sequoia Capital, Qualcomm and SparkLabs Taipei.Kneron declined to disclose the dollar amount of the investment from Foxconn and Winbond due to investor requests but said it was an “eight figures” deal, founder and CEO Albert Liu told TechCrunch in an interview.Founded in 2015, Kneron’s latest product is a neural processing unit that can enable sophisticated AI applications without relying on the cloud. The startup is directly taking on the chips of Intel and Google, which it claims are more energy-consuming than its offering. The startup recently got a talent boost after hiring Davis Chen, Qualcomm’s former Taipei head of engineering.Among Kneron’s customers are Chinese air conditioning giant Gree and German autonomous driving software provider Teraki, and the new deal is turning the world’s largest electronics manufacturer into a client. As part of the strategic agreement, Kneron will work with Foxconn on the latter’s smart manufacturing and newly introduced open platform for electric vehicles, while its work with Winbond will focus on microcontroller unit (MCU)-based AI and memory computing.“Low-power AI chips are pretty easy to put into sensors. We all know that in some operation lines, sensors are quite small, so it’s not easy to use a big GPU [graphics processing unit] or CPU [central processing unit], especially when power consumption is a big concern,” said Liu, who held R&D positions at Qualcomm and Samsung before founding Kneron.Kneron launches its new AI chip to challenge Google and othersUnlike some of its competitors, Kneron designs chips for a wide range of use cases, from manufacturing, smart homes, smartphones, robotics, surveillance and payments, to autonomous driving. It doesn’t just make chips but also the AI software embedded in the chips, a strategy that Liu said differentiates his company from China’s AI darlings like SenseTime and Megvii, which enable AI service through the cloud.Kneron has also been on a less aggressive funding pace than these companies, which fuel their rapid expansion through outsize financing rounds. Six-year-old SenseTime has raised about $2.6 billion to date, while nine-year-old Megvii has banked about $1.4 billion. Kneron, in comparison, has raised just over $70 million from a Series A round.Like the Chinese AI upstarts, Kneron is weighing an initial public offering. The company is expected to make a profit in 2023, Liu said, and “that will probably be a good time for us to go IPO.”']",has a growing e-commerce business,"['Kneron', 'NavigationClose', 'Kneron', 'Liao@ritacyliao', 'Kneron', 'Winbond', 'Kneron', 'Li Ka-Shing’s Horizons Ventures', 'Alibaba Entrepreneurship Fund', 'SparkLabs Taipei', 'Kneron', 'Albert Liu', 'Kneron’s', 'AI', 'Intel', 'Google', 'Davis Chen', 'Kneron', 'Teraki', 'Kneron', 'Winbond', 'AI', 'AI', 'GPU', 'Liu', 'Qualcomm', 'Samsung', 'Kneron', 'Kneron', 'AI', 'Kneron', 'AI', 'Liu', 'AI', 'Kneron', 'Kneron', 'Kneron', 'Liu', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'FundingStartupsTCAlbert Liuartificial', 'Kneron', 'Kneron', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/fYcWis646g,2021-01-19T09:57:27,Google backs India’s Dunzo in $40 million funding round,"['Google is writing a check to another startup in India. The Android-maker, which last year unveiled a $10 billion fund to invest in the world’s second-largest internet market, said on Tuesday that it is participating in a $40 million investment round of hyperlocal delivery startup Dunzo, a Bangalore-based firm that it has also previously backed.Five-year-old Dunzo said Google, Lightbox, Evolvence, Hana Financial Investment, LGT Lightstone Aspada and Alteria among others participated in its Series E financing round, which brings its to-date raise to $121 million.Dunzo operates an eponymous hyper-local delivery service in nearly a dozen cities in India, including Bangalore, Delhi, Noida, Pune, Gurgaon, Powai, Hyderabad and Chennai. Users get access to a wide range of items across several categories, from grocery, perishables, pet supplies and medicines to dinner from their neighborhood stores and restaurants.Google-backed Dunzo raises $45M to expand its hyperlocal delivery startup in IndiaE-commerce accounts for less than 3% of all retail sales in India, according to industry estimates. Mom and pop stores and other neighborhood outlets that dot tens of thousands of cities, towns, villages and slums across the country drive most of the sales in the nation.In a way, Dunzo is reimagining how e-commerce and delivery could be done in India, thereby posing a challenge to Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, as well as local food and grocery delivery startups such as Swiggy, Zomato, BigBasket and Grofers. Several people also use Dunzo to pick up and move random items such as a laptop charger or a wallet or a lunch box from one point in the city to another.“As merchants go digital, Dunzo is helping small businesses in their digital transformation journey in support of business recovery,” said Caesar Sengupta, VP, Google, in a statement. “Through our India Digitization Fund, we’re committed to partnering with India’s innovative startups to build a truly inclusive digital economy that will benefit everyone.”Kabeer Biswas, chief executive and co-founder of Dunzo, said the startup has grown its annual gross merchandise value business to about $100 million. (GMV used to a popular metric that several e-commerce firms relied on to demonstrate their growth; however, it’s one of the meaningless ways to gauge a startup’s growth. Most firms have stopped using GMV. Additionally, when a startup speaks GMV language, traditionally it has meant they are anything but close to profitability, which happens to be true in the case of Dunzo.)“Dunzo’s mission resonated stronger than ever in 2020. We have been amazed by everything merchants and users have started to depend on the platform for. We truly believe we are writing a playbook for how hyperlocal businesses can be built with sustainable unit economics and capital responsibility. As a team, we are more focused than ever to enable local Merchants to get closer to their Users and build one of the most loved consumer brands in the country,” Biswas said in a statement.Google, which invested $4.5 billion in Jio Platforms last year, recently backed social news app DailyHunt and Glance, a part of ad giant InMobi Group that is aggressively expanding ways to populate content on Android users’ lockscreens. Google is also in talks with local social media ShareChat and may alone invest more than $100 million in the Indian startup, TechCrunch reported earlier this month.

https://t.co/eY6qKx31Xa,2021-01-19T09:50:50,Health insurance startup Alan launches free medical app Alan Baby,"['French startup Alan is generating 100% of its revenue from health insurance products — and that isn’t going to change. But the company wants to start a conversation with a bigger use base. Alan is going to launch multiple mobile apps that let you learn more about health topics, contact a doctor and chat with the community.“We are proud to announce today that we’re launching free medical apps for everyone,” co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve said in a virtual press conference. “We’re going to develop services for specific groups of people who are facing specific issues or questions.”And the company is starting with Alan Baby. As you can guess from the name, Alan Baby helps you stay on top of your baby’s health. The company has chosen to focus on that segment as your baby’s health can be a great source of mental stress.When you first open the app, you get a feed of articles on specific topics, from sleep to nutrition and child development. You can get relevant articles by entering the birthdate of your child as you often don’t have the same questions at day one and day 100.If you’re concerned about data, Alan says that it doesn’t leverage data for its insurance products — you can optionally enter the age in Alan Baby to customize content but that’s it. Health insurance companies in France don’t have a lot of wiggle room when it comes to data. Companies sign a health insurance contract for their employees. Insurance companies can’t accept or deny someone after that. They can’t set a higher price due to medical history.While parents usually have 10 pediatrician appointments in the first year, you may have a burning question that cannot wait that long. From Alan Baby, you can start a text discussion with a doctor. The company says users should expect an answer within 24 hours.Alan had already hired doctors for a similar messaging feature for its users who are covered under the health insurance products. The company is opening up that feature to more users beyond its paid customers.Finally, people who install Alan Baby can interact with each other in the community section. It works a bit like an online forum on health topics, except that it’s mobile-first and Alan wants to moderate it with some help from its doctors.“Thanks to what we’re setting up for parents, we will be able to extend it to other topics soon,” Samuelian-Werve said. He names fertility, mental health or diabetes as potential topics for other free apps.While the apps are going to be free, the company expects to attract new clients for its health insurance thanks to those new apps. Essentially, Alan is broadening the top of its sales funnel with free apps.Alan Baby is rolling out progressively in France. There’s a waitlist and the iOS app is available to pre-order (for free) in the App Store.An update on the health insurance productsBack in October, Samuelian-Werve told me that 100,000 were covered through Alan. A few months later, 139,000 people are covered through one Alan insurance product or another. Overall, 8,300 companies have chosen the company as their health insurance provider. Basically, Alan’s user base has more than doubled in 2020.In France, employees are covered by both the national healthcare system and private insurance companies. So Alan convinces other companies to use its product for its employees. The company has obtained its own health insurance license, which means that it can customize its health insurance products completely, depending on the segment and client.The company is also operating in Spain and Belgium. But it’s been a slow start, with 300 members in Spain and 500 members in Belgium. Alan is going to focus on those two markets before launching new countries in the future.Health insurance startup Alan lets you chat with a doctor']",survey,"['Alan', 'Alan Baby', 'NavigationClose ScreenHealth', 'Alan', 'Alan BabyRomain Dillet@romaindillet', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve', 'Alan Baby', 'Alan Baby', 'Alan', 'Alan Baby', 'Alan Baby', 'Alan', 'Alan Baby', 'Alan', 'Samuelian-Werve', 'Alan', 'Alan Baby', 'Samuelian-Werve', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'Alan’s', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Alan', 'Alan BabyRomain Dillet10:50', 'Alan', 'Alan', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/E0iUqdVTDL,2021-01-19T09:22:26,TikTok’s Chinese version Douyin launches an e-wallet,"['Tencent’s WeChat Pay and Alibaba’s affiliate Alipay have long dominated digital payments in China, but they have always faced new challengers. The latest entrant in online payments is Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese version.The short video app recently added “Douyin Pay” to its list of existing payment options, which have included Alipay and WeChat Pay.“The set-up of Douyin Pay (Douyin Zhifu) is to supplement the existing major payment options, and to ultimately enhance user experience on Douyin,” a Douyin spokesperson said.Payment is a natural step for Douyin, which has a growing e-commerce business. Users can be directed to a product link while watching a video of an influencer reviewing, say, a lipstick. Instead of the ubiquitous WeChat Pay and Alipay, they may opt for Douyin Pay one day, if the incentives are great enough.Other internet giants, such as e-commerce giant JD.com and food delivery service Meituan, have also tried luring people to use their own payment methods, though the market duopoly is hard to break. All in all, Alipay and WeChat Pay handle about 90% of China’s electronic payments.Like other internet firms, Douyin parent ByteDance snapped up a coveted payments license by acquiring a third-party payments firm. Last September, a company controlled by ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming bought out a payments solution provider called Wuhan Hezhong Yibao Technology Co. The license, in turn, allows Douyin, Toutiao and other ByteDance services to offer payment features.Users can, for instance, receive a cash-filled electronic red packet from a Douyin campaign and deposit that cash to their bank accounts.Douyin PayThe rollout of Douyin Pay seems well-timed with the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday, a time when families and friends gift each other red packets.

It uses drones, combined with AI, to gather images and detect risk automatically.This is in contrast to the status quo, where powerlines are typically inspected by teams of people and helicopters, which is time-consuming and potentially dangerous. The idea behind Skyqraft is to enable safer powerline inspections in a more cost-efficient and environmentally sustainable way.Skyqraft, a startup using AI and drones for electricity power-line inspection, raises $505K“Powerline inspections most importantly are not environmentally friendly, very costly and unsafe with the use of helicopters and people,” Skyqraft co-founder and CMO Sakina Turabali told TechCrunch when Skyqraft announced its pre-seed funding. “We provide smart infrastructure inspections using unmanned airplanes by gathering images and 360 videos and feeding that data into a machine learning system that automatically detects any risk to the powerlines.”Skyqraft says the system can process high volumes of image data and is able to detect equipment issues “rapidly and with high accuracy”. By using Skyqraft, the Swedish company claims utility companies can shorten a 25km powerline inspection from two days to “three minutes”.Image Credits: SkyqraftThat proposition appears to already be resonating with customers, which include the three largest utility companies in Sweden jointly representing 85% of the Swedish market. Additionally, Skyqraft says it is also negotiating a series of larger-scale pilots in the U.S. in 2021 with the global utility company Iberdrola.Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin backs ‘startup generator’ Antler']",DeHaat,"['NavigationClose', 'SkyqraftSkyqraft', 'AI', 'Subvenio Invest', 'Antler', 'Next Human Ventures', 'Skyqraft', 'AI', 'AI', 'CMO Sakina Turabali', 'Skyqraft', 'Eduardo Saverin', 'AntlerclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'InvestSkyqraft', 'AI', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/ilhgt3mowo,2021-01-19T08:00:12,LeoCare raises $18.1 million for its insurance products designed to fit in a mobile app,"['French startup LeoCare has raised a €15 million funding round. Felix Capital, Ventech and Daphni are participating in today’s funding round. The company is selling a portfolio of insurance products with a focus on the signup process and user experience. You can control your insurance products from a mobile app.Chances are you already pay for multiple insurance products. But when is the last time you checked your coverage and adjusted your contract? When people sign up to a new insurance product, they tend to set it and forget it.That’s why insurance companies don’t invest a ton of money on mobile apps, control panels and user-facing features. LeoCare believes there’s room for a player that does the opposite.LeoCare can insure your home, your car, your motorbike and your smartphone. You can sign up from the company’s website or install a mobile app. The company has tried to optimize the onboarding process with easy-to-understand questions and an indicator that tells you if you’re going to pay a bit more or a lot more if you choose one option or another.When you sign up, you get your insurance contract right away. This way, you can send it to a landlord a few minutes later. But LeoCare also helps you manage your contract later down the road. For instance, many LeoCare customers chose to lower their car insurance premiums during lockdown. You can also add another driver for a couple of weeks.Behind the scenes, LeoCare acts as a managing general agent. The startup partners with several insurance companies and sells its insurance products under its own brand. The company currently charges €1 million in premiums per month and has 20,000 customers.According to LeoCare, 63% of contracts cover a car, 26% of contracts cover a home, 7% of contracts are for motorcyclists and 4% of contracts focus on smartphones. And LeoCare is growing rapidly, with a current month-over-month growth rate of 38%.Up next, the company wants to launch new features, such as a bot that lets you check the status of your case. LeoCare is also working on a feature that lets you receive a notification when you’re driving and there are usually a lot of road accidents in the area.Finally, the startup wants to launch a marketplace of professionals. This could be helpful if you’re looking for a plumber for instance. And it could represent a new revenue stream for the startup.LeoCare plans to grow its insurance portfolio sevenfold by the end of 2021. The team will also grow from 35 to 80 people.Hong Kong insurtech startup Coherent gets $14 million Series A led by Cathay Innovation']",Darwinbox,"['LeoCare', 'NavigationClose', 'appRomain Dillet@romaindillet / 9:00 AM', 'LeoCare', 'Felix Capital', 'Ventech', 'Daphni', 'LeoCare', 'LeoCare', 'LeoCare', 'LeoCare', 'LeoCare', 'LeoCare', 'Coherent', 'Cathay InnovationclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Dillet9:00 AM', 'LeoCare', 'Felix Capital', 'Ventech', 'Daphni', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/yrtf3Ndzw2,2021-01-19T04:30:00,Prosus Ventures leads $30 million investment in Indian agritech startup DeHaat,"['Once overlooked, agritech startups are beginning to have a moment in India.On Tuesday, DeHaat, an online platform that offers full-stack agricultural services to farmers, said it has raised $30 million in a new financing round as the Indian firm looks to maintain its accelerated growth despite the pandemic.Prosus Ventures, formerly known as Naspers Ventures, led Patna and Gurgaon-based startup’s Series C financing round. RTP Global and existing investors Sequoia Capital India, FMO, Omnivore and AgFunder also participated, bringing the startup’s to-date raise to over $46 million. (Dexter Capital was the advisor for this funding round.)One of the biggest challenges farmers in India face is securing agri-input items such as seeds and fertilizers and then finding buyers after producing the yields.Agritech startup DeHaat raises $12M to reach more farmers in IndiaDeHaat, which is Hindi for village, is solving this by bringing brands, institutional financers and buyers to one platform, which is accessible through a helpline and an app in local languages.Only about a third of the yields Indian farmers produce reaches the big markets, according to industry estimates. It’s traditionally proven immensely difficult for farmers to find buyers for their produce.Once the season is over, DeHaat helps farmers sell their yields to bulk buyers such as business-to-business marketplace Udaan, Reliance Fresh and food delivery firm Zomato.The 10-year-old startup has also developed a database of crop tests and uses artificial intelligence to provide farmers with free-of-cost personalized advisory on what they should sow in a season. DeHaat also helps farmers secure working capital through partnership with hundreds of institutional firms.We wrote about DeHaat last year, when it had raised a $12 million financing round. The past nine months has been the story of its accelerated growth despite the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted lockdowns across the nation for several months.The startup, which today has presence in the eastern part of India — states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal — serves close to 400,000 farmers, up from about 210,000 in April last year, Shashank Kumar, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, told TechCrunch in an interview.How the startup is tackling these challenges is equally impressive. It works with nearly 1,400 micro-entrepreneurs, up from about 400 last year, in rural areas who distribute over 4,000 types of agri-input goods to farmers from their regional hubs and then bring back the output to the same hub. “They are the ones responsible for last-mile delivery and aggregation,” he said.UrbanKisaan is betting on vertical farming to bring pesticide-free vegetables to consumers and fight India’s water crisisDeHaat has grown on every front, including the revenue it clocks, which is up 3X to 3.5X since last year, he said.“At the end of March, our daily volume out was around 200 metric tonne. Now it’s over 600 metric tonne. Everyday we aggregate this much from farmers and supply to FMCG players and modern retails. Similarly on the agri-input side — seed, fertilizers and pesticide — we are processing close to 10,000 orders everyday, compared to about 2,600 in March of last year,” he said.“Prosus Ventures invests in industries around the world where innovation can significantly address big societal needs,” said Ashutosh Sharma, head of India Investments at Prosus Ventures, in a statement.“DeHaat is catering to a massive market in India with the agriculture sector worth more than $350 billion to the country’s economy and consisting of an estimated 140 million+ farmers. Through its end-to-end agricultural services offerings, DeHaat will have a major societal impact in India, improving the earning potential for Indian farmers and overall yield for the sector while also enabling microentrepreneurs all over the country, including in rural areas where there is often less income opportunity,” he added.The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand to more states in India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and eventually serve 10 million farmers.Arya raises $21M to provide farmers in India finance and post-harvest servicesAnd another area where it intends to focus is hiring top tech talent. The startup has doubled its workforce since the past year, with many high-profile hires from major firms. The startup, which recently made its second acquisition, is also open to exploring more M&A opportunities, said DeHaat’s Shashank Kumar.Once ignored, scores of agritech startups have cropped up in India in recent years — and many old startups are beginning to receive large-sized checks from investors.Around two dozen #agritech startups have raised funds this year (till date) ErgosUnnati BijakDeHaatNinjacartGourmet GardenFarmers Fresh ZoneKrishitantra KheytiBigHaatVeGrowProcolAgro2oWaycoolJai KisanIntello LabsCrofarmEggozAibonoAryaCloverKisan Network— Harsh Upadhyay (@upadhyay_harsh1) October 13, 2020Further reading: Omnivore and Accel recently co-authored a report on India’s agritech landscape.']",raised record amounts of funding,"['DeHaat', 'DeHaat', 'Prosus Ventures', 'Naspers Ventures', 'Patna', 'Sequoia Capital India', 'FMO', 'AgFunder', 'Dexter Capital', 'Agritech', 'DeHaat', 'DeHaat', 'Udaan', 'DeHaat', 'DeHaat', 'Uttar Pradesh', 'Shashank Kumar', 'UrbanKisaan', 'Ashutosh Sharma', 'India Investments', 'Prosus Ventures', 'DeHaat', 'Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh', 'Maharashtra', 'Arya', 'DeHaat’s', 'Shashank Kumar', 'ErgosUnnati', 'KisanIntello LabsCrofarmEggozAibonoAryaCloverKisan Network', 'Harsh Upadhyay', 'Accel', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'VenturesProsus Ventures', 'Singh5:30 AM', 'DeHaat', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

WhatsApp has amassed over 450 million users in India, its biggest market by users.Mittal described opportunities in building virtual worlds as a “much better approach for today’s world that is unconstrained by cheap, fast data and powerful smartphones.”The end of Hike’s messenger service comes at a time when Signal and Telegram have added tens of millions of users in recent weeks. A planned update to WhatsApp’s data-sharing policy has prompted many of its loyal fans to explore alternatives this month. “Both [Telegram and Signal] are very good. As entities they have the right incentives (more aligned with consumers) unlike Facebook products,” tweeted Mittal earlier this month.In recent years, Hike made bets on stickers and emojis to cater to the younger population in India. In a meeting with TechCrunch in late 2019, Mittal said that the startup was overwhelmed with the engagement stickers on its platform and was working to automate development of personalized stickers.In a different meeting last year, Mittal showcased emojis that replicated human expressions and a virtual hangout place called HikeLand. Vibe is the rebranded version of HikeLand and the emojis Hike developed will continue to be available to users on both the newer apps, Mittal said earlier this month.Hike, which has raised more than $260 million to date, had enough runway last year, Mittal said, who hinted that the startup may raise more capital a year later.Hike also attempted to build its own operating system through acquisition of a startup called Creo. In 2018, Hike launched Total OS that aimed to cater to users with low-cost Android smartphones and slow internet data.The startup later shut down the project. Mittal told TechCrunch that the arrival of Reliance Jio, which prompted Airtel and Vodafone to lower mobile data tariff on their networks, solved the data issues in the country and Total OS was no longer needed in the market.India’s WhatsApp rival Hike raises $175M led by Tencent at a $1.4B valuation']",Volopay,"['Hike', 'WhatsApp', 'Hike', 'WhatsApp', 'Anindito Mukherjee', 'Bloomberg / Getty ImagesIndia’s', 'WhatsApp', 'Hike Messenger', 'Tiger Global', 'SoftBank', 'Kavin Bharti Mittal', 'Rush', 'Mittal', 'Airtel’s', 'Sunil Bharti Mittal', 'Kavin', 'WhatsApp', 'Hike’s', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'WhatsApp’s', 'Signal', 'Hike', 'Mittal', 'Mittal', 'Hike', 'Mittal', 'Mittal', 'Hike', 'Android', 'Mittal', 'Reliance Jio', 'Airtel', 'Vodafone', 'WhatsApp', 'Hike', 'Tencent', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Hike', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Hike Messenger', 'Tiger Global', 'SoftBank', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

This is one of Salesforce Ventures’ rare investments in Asia. Existing investors, including Lightspeed India and Sequoia Capital India, also participated in the round, which brings the five-year-old startup’s raise to-date to about $35 million.More than 500 firms — including Tokopedia, Indorama, JG Summit Group, Zilingo, Zalora, Fave, Adani, Mahindra, Kotak, TVS, National Stock Exchange, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, Dr.Reddy’s, Nivea, Puma, Swiggy and Bigbasket — use Darwinbox’s HR platform to provide more than a million employees of theirs with a range of features in 60 nations, up from about 200 firms across 50 nations in late 2019, said Chaitanya Peddi, co-founder of Darwinbox, in an interview with TechCrunch.Peddi said the startup has always looked up to Salesforce for inspiration, and investment from the enterprise giant is “nothing sort of a child receiving validation from their father,” he said.The fundraise caps the most successful year for the startup that started with uncertainty as the coronavirus spread across Asian nations. The startup initially took a hit as its customers scrambled to navigate through the global pandemic, but the last two quarters have been its best to date, said Peddi.Overall, the startup’s revenue has ballooned by 300% since September 2019, when it last raised money, he said. “In HR tech and SaaS space, we are now only behind SAP and Oracle in India in terms of revenue,” he said.Dev Khare, a partner at Lightspeed India, an early backer of the startup, said that Darwinbox has become the preferred human capital management solution for Asian conglomerates, governments and high-growth businesses and multi-national corporations operating in Asia as they witness digital transformation.Image Credits: DarwinboxDarwinbox’s platform is built to take care of the entire “hiring to retiring” cycle needs of employees. It handles onboarding of new hires, keeps a tab on their performance, monitors attrition rate, and provides an ongoing feedback loop.It also provides its customers with a social network for their employees to remain connected with one another and an AI assistant to apply for a leave or set up meetings with quick voice commands from their phones.Peddi said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to expand to several more countries, especially in more emerging markets in the Middle East Asia and Africa, and broaden its offerings. “We will be leveraging the power of our platform to do a lot more. We are a product-led firm and our focus will remain on innovation in that space,” he said. The startup is also open to exploring opportunities to acquire smaller firms for inorganic growth, he said.“India is home to one of the world’s youngest populations, and by 2050, it is expected to account for over 18% of the global working age population,” said Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairperson and CEO, Salesforce India, in a statement. “This makes technology platforms like Darwinbox, that focuses on workforces, incredibly important. I’m proud that Salesforce is supporting Darwinbox on their journey as they continue to grow and innovate in this space.”Alex Kayyal, partner and head of international at Salesforce Ventures, told TechCrunch in an interview that the firm helps its partners in a number of ways, including exposing them to the firm’s customers, executives and their networks, and helping startups scale their business.“We have one of the most innovative and disruptive customer bases that are looking for cloud solutions and digital transformation. So the opportunity to expose companies like Darwinbox to our customer base is something we get really excited about,” said Kayyal.

Guardicore is disrupting the traditional firewall market by providing fine-grained segmentation for greater attack resistance. Led by CEO Pavel Gurevich the company is seeing excellent traction. Riskified makes e-ommerce easier and safer and enables a thriving e-commerce environment. Founder duo Eido Gal and Assaf Feldman are a powerhouse of vision and execution capabilities. Talkspace has not only created the leading online therapy business, but is actually improving the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Americans, which are gaining access to therapy for the first time. Founding husband and wife Oren and Roni Frank are the ultimate power couple — creating an incredible business while creating some real impact.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nTech investors must make sure that Israel is part of their portfolio. Same as VC funds are deeply acquainted with Silicon Valley, tech investors cannot ignore this hub of innovation that has produced global market leading companies and serial entrepreneursWhat are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nProducts and services that require anything requiring on-site visits and integration as well as a long sales cycle involving face-to-face meetings and customer education are negatively impacted during this time. The upside is that companies that will develop a remote and simplified approach can reap gains from this time. Such an example is Augury from our portfolio that has developed an end-to-end solution to provide manufacturers with early, actionable and comprehensive insights into machine health and performance. This has proved to be of crucial value in the supply chain during the pandemic.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?\nEarlier in the month we have closed our third fund, Qumra III, at $260 million. This was done in a short time in a period when traveling and face-to-face meetings were impossible. Commitments to this fund, which is larger than its predecessor, included increased investments form existing LPs as well as new LPs from new geographies. This is a vote of confidence in the Israeli growth market in general and in Qumra in particular and has been a great achievement and source of hope going forward.Rafi Carmeli, Viola GrowthWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nPlatforms that are transforming how people and businesses operate, go about their business or leverage their core assets, using superior products, data and AI.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nZoomin Software.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nTransformation of the CFO and treasury suite of tools.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nA+ team, superior product demonstrated with business/market traction and a sizable market opportunity.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?Any area that needs to compete both with incumbents and also a set of already successful “new age” companies that made the first step of meaningful disruption.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nMore than 50%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?Plenty of interesting opportunities but like many places, competitive around the best of the best.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nDefinitely see changes in evolution of young startups given the behavioral changes caused by COVID.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nAny area that is exposed to mass physical engagement (pockets in travel, food, sports, etc.) are at risk. Remote engagement and productivity have potential to disrupt more industries, such as corporate events/virtual events.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nFounders are generally resilient and based on their view on the company’s position post-COVID (winner/at risk) and the capital resources available, should decide on appropriate level of caution/aggressiveness.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes in many areas. In general software has proven to be a winner and specifically SaaS as a business model has proven its resilience.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nThe speed and decisiveness at which humanity acted to adjust to the effects and aftermath of the pandemic, and importantly to proactively get us all out of the health and economic crisis as quickly as possible (e.g., the speed of creating vaccines).Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nIf something won’t matter in five years, don’t waste more than five minutes worrying about it now — easier said than done!Yonatan Mandelbaum, TLV PartnersWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nFintech (specifically embedded finance or financial SaaS), synthetic bio. This is in addition to traditional focus areas that we remain bullish on — cloud infrastructure, ML infra and cyber.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nUnit.co, meshpayments.com.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nThere simply isn’t enough innovation in fintech from the Israeli ecosystem. Our locale has managed to produce three of the most prolific insurtech companies (Next, Lemonade and Hippo), has a strong history of successful fintech companies (Payoneer, Forter, Riskified) and even has a few very promising earlier-stage ventures (Unit, Melio). That said, only about 10% of our overall deal flow are fintech companies. Areas such as vertical banking, embedded finance, compliance as a service and consumer finance consistently get overlooked by young Israeli founders.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nThe cliche VC answer: strong team, big market. This remains constant during all times.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\n(1) Cybersecurity — with one caveat. Israel will always be at the forefront of cyber innovation, and thus there will always be an opportunity for fledgling cyber companies in Israel. That said, it is 100% oversaturated, and there are too many examples of strong technical founders creating “yet another” SaaS security startup. (2) Remote work collaboration — clearly an issue that needs solving, but we have unsurprisingly seen an absurd amount of companies in the space. They are largely reactionary companies, and the companies that will prove to be the winners in this market have already been in the market for quite some time (Zoom, Alack, Miro, etc.).How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nMore than 50%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nFintech and bio are very well-positioned to thrive in Israel. In 10 years I wouldn’t be surprised if Israel is more well-known for those two sectors than it is for its cyber companies. Some companies to keep an eye on: Next Insurance, Unit, Mesh Payments, Aidoc, Deepcure, Immunai.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nI’m not saying anything new, but Israel is known as the startup nation for a reason. There is an incredible, thriving entrepreneurship culture that breeds fascinating companies weekly. Interestingly, valuation trends seem to trail the U.S. by about 12-18 months. So for later-stage VCs around the globe, Israel can represent an interesting opportunity to do deals of the same quality that they are doing in their locale, but for a more reasonable price.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nNot particularly. Israel a small country, and even if there may be a residential exodus from Tel Aviv, there won’t be a commercial one.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nTravel and proptech are more exposed due to COVID-19.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nCOVID hasn’t impacted our investment strategy much. We have remained steady in our search for interesting early-stage software opportunities and our commitment to invest substantial amounts even at the seed round. The biggest worries of the portfolio founders surround slower enterprise sales cycles due to WFH and smaller budgets from potential customers. Our early advice to founders was to ensure runway for 18 months in order to weather the storm. Recently however, after witnessing the incredibly founder-friendly fundraising landscape, our advice has been to put the pedal to the metal, reach certain benchmarks and raise capital.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nNo, there still hasn’t been enough time. That said, I will say that the initial enthusiasm of WFH has faded. The vast majority of our companies are clamoring to be back in the office.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nMy grandparents both recently passed away from COVID-19. Despite the tragic loss that it was for my family, there was one moment that truly gave me hope. I had the opportunity to visit my grandmother in the COVID ward at a local hospital before she passed (in full protective gear of course). Before entering the ward, while the nurses were going over the protocols with me and four other individuals who were there to visit their sick family members, I was surprised to realize that the five of us in the room were an eclectic bunch. Jewish, Muslim, religious and not, young and old. In that moment, we all gave each other strength, wished each other well and it gave me hope that we can truly become a unified country in the near future. The next exponential growth that occurs in the Israeli ecosystem will be when there is an influx of minorities (Arabs, ultra-Orthodox) into the workforce.Natalie Refuah, Viola GrowthWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nDevOps, martech, digital health.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nRapidAPI.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nExciting team, hypergrowth, disruptiveness.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nCyber, automotive.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nClose to 100%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nDevOps, cyber, enterprise software.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nVery positively.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nThere will be changes, that’s for sure.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?E-commerce tech-related companies will thrive.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nWe lowered our check size per company. My advice — if you are “with COVID trend” push hard, if you are “against COVID trend” — preserve cash.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nMore time with my kids, but in general I miss hugging people when i meet them, and I prefer meeting people face to face.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nLet the vaccine go!Daniel Cohen, Viola VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nGames, vertical AI and AI agencies, digital health.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nHyperguest, creating direct connectivity between hotels and OTAs. It’s the perfect next-gen travel infrastructure for the world post-pandemic.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nThe biggest trend in the post-COVID world will be the new work environment. We would love to see more startups that will create corporate solutions that are focused on the future of work. That can be at the workplace or at the home.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nUnique, innovative go-to-market. Leveraging technology to reach consumers in a more innovative way. It’s basically innovation in growth hacking, not only in great products.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nCybersecurity — the market is real and important, but there are too many startups with small niche solutions.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nMore than 50%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nThe most exciting trends locally are everything AI with focus on B2B apps. Same goes with digital health and consumer-focused health applications.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nIsrael is the #1 region globally in unicorn production, probably the hottest startup region right now.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nNo.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?The biggest change has been on company culture, which is hard to maintain in a distributed work-from-home environment. Companies need to be innovative and creative in maintaining/building culture, which was so much easier pre-COVID.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic? What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.The announcements around the vaccines make it clear that the end of the pandemic is near. I think 2021 will be amazing.Ben Wiener, Jumpspeed VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nJumpspeed invests exclusively in pre-seed and seed-stage startups from the Jerusalem startup ecosystem.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nMDGo.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nNot really, we are sector agnostic/bottom-up rather than thesis driven.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\n10x better, paradigm-shift solution to a large, near-term, acute business problem, produced and led by a complementary founding team (hacker+hustler+designer).Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nCybersecurity, crypto, telehealth.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nEXCLUSIVELY, see above.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nJerusalem is well-positioned in certain clusters such as computer vision, general enterprise SaaS, AI/ML and healthtech.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nOur city’s startup ecosystem is underexploited and generates a few fantastic under-the-radar opportunities per year.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nYes.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nLittle direct impact on strategy because by definition I am investing in things that will go to market and ripen over years.Founders’ biggest worries are employee well-being, after that access to overseas customers and markets.Advice to founders: Stay calm and healthy, play the long game, take care of yourself, your family and your employees, don’t panic or cut staff reactively.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes but not that I can attribute directly to the pandemic.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nNo specific moment, just the general resilience and ability to adapt to the radically changing new realities that our portfolio founders have exhibited.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\n“Entrepreneurship in advanced technology, is not merely a matter of decision-making; it is a matter of imposing cognitive order on situations that are repeatedly ill-defined.” — W. Brian Arthur, “The Nature of Technology”No situation has been this ill-defined in the past century. Keep calm and carry on :-)Inbal Perlman, TAU VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nAt TAU, we are interested in a variety of sectors and evaluate each potential investment independently. In regards to trends, we look at trends with a grain of salt understanding that trends might come and go. When we see a particular trend, we try to understand if there is a need behind the trend and see beyond the initial hype. We want to assure that a startup is meeting a real need in the market. We are particularly interested in technologies that do not require too much time and capital to get to market.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nWe invested in a company called Xtend, which is creating human-machine telepresence allowing us to “step into” a machine, anywhere in the world, breaking the limits of physical reality. In particular, it develops solutions that allow people to interact with drones and other unmanned machine technologies. The company’s technology enables humans to extend themselves into the action by allowing them to virtually sit inside the drone for various tactical missions. What is exciting about Xtend is how the technology can be implemented in a variety of ways from defense and homeland security to reimagining entertainment, gaming and cinematography.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nWe like to see startups that are disrupting traditional industries by solving basic challenges and needs with innovative means. There are some industries that haven’t changed in many years. And if you create a technology that can be simply integrated into existing markets, it has the potential to gain significant traction and drastically change an industry. So we would love to see more startups going “back to the basics” asking questions about commonly felt pain points and innovating to solve those pains.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nWe want to get the feeling from the entrepreneur that they are professional, ready for the entrepreneurial journey, have the right mindset and skill set and will conquer the world. We understand that with early-stage startups, the product or service will likely change and therefore pay significant attention to the entrepreneurs themselves as an early indicator of future success.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nTechnology trends that often come and go can create an oversaturated market for startups. For example, previously there was hype around drones. Now, only the strongest companies in the drone industry have stuck around. Today, there are many startups responding to needs exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic such as remote learning and remote work. It is important to filter out whether these are solutions that will be around for a while and survive a post-COVID world or are temporary.We are more cautious about particular industries. In edtech, those who have successfully done exits, have done so at low amounts ($200 million-$300 million). For us, we are seeking larger exits. Blockchain is a difficult sector because it lacks a clear regulatory environment, subsequently raising many questions. Similarly, the cannabis industry also does not have a fixed regulatory environment across countries. Any small regulation change can highly impact the company. These are the sectors and areas that we are more cautious around.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nWe invest in startups that are exclusively Israeli startups but are targeted for a global market. At TAU Ventures, we have 1,000 sq. meter coworking office space where majority of our portfolio companies and accelerator program companies sit on a daily basis. On a daily basis we are engaging with our startups through kitchen chats and hallway encounters. Through our coworking space, we are directly investing in our local ecosystem both supporting entrepreneurs and identifying rising entrepreneurs.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nIn Israel, many Israeli entrepreneurs bring a high level of technical capabilities that they learn in the army such as in cyber and AI. After acquiring this knowledge and ability, they are well-prepared and able to transfer it to the commercial area. This is why we see many successful startups coming out of Israel particularly in these fields.\nFor example, founders of our portfolio company, SWIMM all come from leading elite tech training units in the army (Aram, Talpiot) and before founding SWIMM, established ITC (Israel Tech Challenge, a nonprofit high-tech academy that offers in-demand tech training programs in English in Tel Aviv, inspired by the IDF’s 8200 unit).\nFurthermore, Tel Aviv University (TAU), our affiliated university, is a leading research institute and academic leader in AI, engineering and other sciences and is producing entrepreneurs with high levels of knowledge. 50% of entrepreneurs in Israel have studied at TAU. And TAU ranked eighth worldwide as a top university producing VC-backed entrepreneurs, and the first outside of the US. So we are very excited by the added advantage we have in being affiliated closely with the university and the talent which it is producing.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nThe significant advantage of Israel is its small size. Because there is little to no local market, startups automatically think globally in their marketing and growth strategies. To best understand Israel and Israelis, it’s important to understand the influence of the military and the reality of thriving in a complex political environment in the Middle East. Military service is compulsory for all Israelis at the age of 18. The army plays an important role in the socialization, education, skills development, social network and fabric of Israeli society. Many personal and professional networks are the result of army service. As Israelis, we live in an environment where we need to constantly be innovative and one step ahead to survive. This innovative mindset has been instilled in our state of mind and cultural DNA.\nWe are proud that In Israel we have academics at the highest level in the world across a variety of fields. Multinationals from all over the world have local R&D centers or innovation hubs in Israel to source from the local talent pool. This presence of multinationals creates mutual exposure for both startups and corporates alike.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nAt TAU Ventures, the majority of our portfolio and accelerator companies sit next to us at our 1,000 sq. meter coworking space. At our offices, we love seeing our founders and their employees on a regular basis. This is how we have successfully created a strong familial culture at our VC. Throughout COVID, companies have continued to come in person to the office. This has reinforced to us that there is no exchange for face-to-face engagement. As early-stage investors, we understand that at this stage it is all about the people. At the end of the day, people want to be around people and you can not replace the experience of sharing a cup of coffee and shaking someone’s hand.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?\nCOVID affected companies in different ways. For some, it boosted business and for others it led them to shift their strategy and approach. Our companies who had clients in the travel industry or airports were obviously affected. In this situation, the company looked at their technology and reconsidered where and how their technology could be relevant to other consumers and industries. This particular company saw an opportunity to shift to logistics and supply chain clients. COVID is presenting opportunities for companies to reevaluate their target market and discover new applications of their technology for different purposes.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nAs a result of COVID, we have come to understand that things simply are taking more time, such as processes of raising funds or achieving the next milestone. We are patient and empathetic to the experiences of our startups.The startups’ most significant worry is that they will not succeed to raise enough funds before reaching their next milestone. And more so, if they are unable to prove their achievement milestones in time, then they might be forced to close business. As a result, our startups are raising more funds during this time to assure a longer runway. Our startups are also keenly aware of how periods of crisis might call on them to pivot and adapt to the current circumstances. Startups are making decisions around adjusting budgets, determining whether customers are still relevant, anticipating whether the circumstances are temporary or will renormalize and ultimately whether there is a completely new path to pivot to.\nIn light of the circumstances, we are advising our portfolio startups to raise more funds in next rounds to have runway for at least 1.5 years and not to be afraid of making drastic changes (i.e., pivots, changing budget, raising more funds).As a fund, we are assuring our entrepreneurs that if they choose to change paths, it is okay. Working from a coworking space alongside many of our founders enables us to stay updated on the startups, foster a strong internal ecosystem and network, and provide ongoing psychological safety for our entrepreneurs, which is ever so needed during these unprecedented times for startups.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nTwo of our portfolio companies have experienced impressive growth and are thriving in 2020.\n1. Gaviti is a SaaS company that specializes in receivable collections acceleration. Its system maps out the collection process to spot inefficiencies and optimize clients’ procedures. Specifically during COVID, many companies had increased economic pain points related to generating cash flow on a timely, efficient basis. Gaviti’s solution helps companies manage their collection payments. As a result of of the economic crisis this year, Gaviti saw fast growth in clients and have thrived during 2020.\n2. Medorion understands that health companies and hospitals want us to get regular health checkouts. Using AI and behavioral science, Medorion is driving people to take action for their own health by increasing engagement and communication between insurance companies and patients. During COVID, they are combating the coronavirus pandemic by applying their technology to create highly personalized engagement and communication plans targeted at those individuals who are at highest risk of COVID-19.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nIn recent months, it is inspiring to see our entrepreneurs continue fighting despite the uncertain economic and global circumstances. Many of our companies are continuing to recruit and hire. Our founders are resilient and are finding creative means to succeed. It is also a blessing to have a large coworking space hosting the offices of 10 startups and to see employees continue to come in to the office day in and day out working with their teams.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nTAU Ventures is a venture capital fund, affiliated with Tel Aviv University, for investing in early-stage, cutting-edge technologies based in Israel. TAU Ventures is the first and only university-affiliated VC in Israel.The fund has a unique, triangle model creating ecosystem connections between industry, academy and entrepreneurs. We connect to available resources at Tel Aviv University, foster strong partnerships in the high-tech industry and support entrepreneurs as they work side by side in the coworking office space of the VC located on the university campus.TAU Ventures also runs incubation programs in a variety of tech fields and offers a vibrant hub for entrepreneurs with concrete opportunities for design partnerships with international leading companies: AlphaC program (in partnership with NEC, Checkpoint, Innogy, Team8 and Cybereason) and The Xcelerator (an acceleration program with the Israeli Security Agency).\nIn 2018, IVC awarded TAU Ventures an award for one of the most active VCs in Israel. And in 2019, Geektime ranked TAU Ventures among the top five best VCs in Israel.David (Dede) Goldschmidt, Samsung Catalyst FundWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nDigital transformation and AI.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nSolarisbank (Germany).Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nAI-acceleration technologies seems to be overcrowded.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nLess than 50%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nAI, cyber security. Excited about our portfolio company Innoviz (LiDAR). Excited about Avigdor Willenz, serial entrepreneur, including our portfolio company Habana Labs that was acquired for $2 billion.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nHighly dynamic and competitive, very global approach of entrepreneurs, risk takers, “can-do” approach.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nI don’t expect that to happen because a strong ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors and service providers would be needed, and it takes years for that to grow.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?\nIndustries serving brick-and-mortars are likely to get weakened by accelerated transition to online.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nOur advice has been to be careful with cash. There is a disconnect between the strong momentum in the tech financing vis-a-vis overall economic crisis (unemployment, governments deficits, etc.). We have yet to see the full impact of COVID-19 on tech startups and better be prepared for that.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes, for pure digital plays.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nFrankly, I remain concerned because of the disconnect alluded to above. Vaccine momentum brings some hope, but too early to tell.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nI am very concerned from potential crunch in early stage. While overall financing numbers are growing almost across all geographies, investments are heavily weighted toward later stage and unicorns, and much fewer new companies are being formed. This will have dramatic impact on the tech ecosystem a few years out, if it does not change in 2021.Dror Nahumi, Norwest Venture PartnersWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nWe are a large fund that invests in early-to-late-stage companies across a wide range of sectors with a focus on consumer, enterprise and healthcare. My focus is primarily in Israeli companies and I’m seeing many exciting startups in security, SaaS, enterprise and cloud infrastructure, robotics and semiconductors.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nWe are naturally excited about all our latest investments. I recently invested in three seed-stage companies that are in stealth mode: an open-source cloud infrastructure company, a people analytics (HR) SaaS company and a next-generation business-intelligence platform.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nI believe there is a massive opportunity for startups to develop new solutions to fuel the digitization of next-generation enterprises. We’re seeing innovation and activity in this sector, but there’s so much more to be done, especially in light of challenges and vulnerabilities that COVID-19 has exposed. The hottest areas will be in human resources, production, security, infrastructure, sales and remote work.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nWe look for a great team, strong intellectual property and compelling execution. The new product idea can be a replacement (i.e., replace existing products that are aging, low performance) or a new category. Gong.io is a great example of a new category we invested in early on. We created the new “revenue intelligence” category that offers businesses automated, unfiltered and real-time insights on customer interactions and deals. This helps businesses understand what’s actually being said to transform the way they go to market.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nSecurity is currently oversaturated. There are too many companies doing similar things, which can make it difficult for newcomers to break through. Additionally, most emerging security startups are all claiming to use machine learning and AI to combat the next level of breaches. These are important areas to focus on, but it’s getting harder for these companies to differentiate themselves. That aside, we have made several great investments in security over the years and will continue to invest in great teams.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nOur team in Israel is 100% focused on our local market.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nNumerous industries in the Israeli market are poised to thrive and are doing so currently. Examples include startups in the security, SaaS, enterprise and the cloud infrastructure space, and even consumer services. We are especially excited to continue to witness the growth and success of Gong, VAST Data, WekaIO, Cynet, Wiliot, ActiveFence, Ermetic and SundaySky while building new companies who are still in the stealth stage.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nAt Norwest and especially among our Israel portfolio companies, we’ve been able to let our companies mature. We’ve given them the time and support they need to reach maturity. This is a very different approach than what we are seeing in other environments.Today, growth comes before M&A and companies get valuations much quicker. In past years, it was hard to raise money but it’s not so difficult now. In Israel, inside sales and marketing analytics allow companies to sell more effectively now than in the last decade. This gives entrepreneurs flexibility, room to expand into other markets and the ability to hire top talent globally versus just within their own region.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nIsrael is so small that you are never really too far outside a major city. We expect our startup hub to stay intact even if individuals and businesses choose to move slightly outside of the main CBD.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nThe travel industry has been massively impacted in every market globally since the COVID-19 outbreak. That said, that means there is a huge opportunity to fill gaps based on business and consumer needs as we approach a post-pandemic normal.I would say that solutions with huge potential are those centered on hybrid workforces as enterprises rethink the future of work. These have the potential to significantly benefit from the pandemic in the short and long term.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nCOVID-19 has not impacted our investment strategy. However, in recent conversations with our portfolio companies, it’s clear that brands can emerge stronger than ever with an adaptable strategy, adjusted expectations, strong marketing and B2C communications, and compassionate leadership.Over the past several months, we’ve advised companies in our portfolio to focus on building their business while prioritizing the safety of their workforce, which could mean further extending work-from-home policies or making remote work a standard option in their hiring practices. Companies’ ability to innovate and adapt while building their business around the new normal will be better positioned to succeed in a post-COVID landscape.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nWhile it’s not one particular moment, there were many times this past year where our portfolio companies faced major challenges due to the pandemic and were still able to continue to expand their businesses. Every sales quarter that shows growth and success gives me hope.Sharin Fisher, Fort Ross VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nI’m mostly excited about AI/ML technologies, cybersecurity companies and the global opportunity in B2B SaaS companies in general; companies that help to optimize business processes and boost efficiency (e.g., one of our portfolio companies, Kryon, is operating in the robotic process automation space, evaluating business processes, and recommending which ones to automate in order to free up underutilized human talent). We are seeing many successful Israeli SaaS companies across the board, from marketing and collaboration tools, business intelligence products, to payment systems.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nMy latest investment was in a B2B SaaS company that disrupts a huge market. I’m mostly excited about the team, which contains senior executives and second-time entrepreneurs with domain expertise.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?We are looking for companies that have a big market, a compelling story and a clear path to building a large business. When we invest, companies already have traction, a diverse customer base, established and repeatable sales process and metrics. So, when we dive deeper into the company’s metrics we would like to see they support the company’s assumptions and ability to scale up properly.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nWFH enablement tools (from security to communication tools).How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nWe are a global VC with a distributed team, focused on investing in midstage companies based in the U.S. and Israel, that can become global leaders. I’m leading our investments in the Israeli companies, globally.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nIsrael is well-positioned to build and grow large companies that can become segment leaders. We are seeing many leading companies across multiple sectors such as mobility (Moovit, Mobileye), cybersecurity (Armis, Cybereason, SentinelOne), fintech (Lemonade, Payoneer, eToro), information technology (Jfrog, Snyk), etc.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nThe Israeli ecosystem has matured significantly over the last decade, mainly due to repeat entrepreneurs who bring knowledge and relevant experience to the table. They aspire to build meaningful companies. On top of that, there’s more available late-stage capital, allowing companies to stay private longer and become mega-acquisitions/IPO.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nThe COVID-19 crisis has impacted Israeli founders in terms of how and from where they work. As many Israeli startups aim to tap into the U.S. market, they usually relocate pretty early on, mainly to build relationships with potential customers. Since the pandemic has created a situation where you have to sell your product/service remotely, physical location has become less relevant. In the short term, I believe we’ll see more Israeli founders working out of Israel, especially when taking into account the advantages (e.g., lower cost of living compared to other places like NYC/San Francisco). In the long run, there’s a high probability that founders who can keep the same sales efficiency remotely will continue to work out of their home country.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nAll of the segments we look at are thriving or haven’t changed significantly. I’m mostly interested in startups that are able to sell remotely and have an established inside sales team with a simple integration/deployment, because I believe they are in a better position to scale faster even in this climate.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nOur investment strategy remains the same; we are still looking to back companies that can become global leaders and aspire to disrupt huge markets. In terms of the work with our portfolio companies, our founders have already made the needed adjustments and are now more focused on capital efficiency and expanding the runway.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nMost of our portfolio adapted to the crisis quite fast and have enough runway to reach their next milestone. For some of our portfolio companies, especially those that support the digital transformation, the pandemic has created business opportunities and accelerated the adoption of their technology. As a result, we deployed additional capital to help them leverage this momentum.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nAlthough the pandemic has created uncertainty for all of us, we have still been seeing more (+14) Israeli companies reaching unicorn status/going public during the past months.Adi Levanon Chazan, Flint CapitalWhat’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nSensi.ai.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nA bit over 50% of the portfolio are Israeli startups, the remaining 50% divide between Europe and the U.S.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nFintech has been continuing to grow and will thrive over time. I’m excited about companies like Melio, Unit, Acrocharge and Rapyd.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nVery important to have local partners and try to expand the local network as much as possible, best would be to have a person on the ground dedicated to Israeli investments.Chaim Meir Tessler, partner, OurCrowdWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nFintech, cloud services, quantum software, cyber.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nClosed at time of writing this: D-ID.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t?

The biggest worry is inadequate funding/runway.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nRealizing that we landed in this pandemic on a moment in history that we had the tools needed to enable a large amount of the world’s population to continue working without having to be in a specific physical location.Noam Kaiser, Intel CapitalWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nCloud adoption through digital transformation to hybrid cloud, 5G, vertical AI-based SaaS.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nCellwize — basically opening up RAN (4G and 5G) to any API, cloud environment compatibility.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nSolution allowing application to run across data sources in multiple buckets across hybrid/multicloud environments.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nDeep understanding of the area and the customer needs, a complementing trend, high revenue potential within five years.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup?

More than 50%? Less?\nMore.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nSafebreach — Red Team automation for cybersecurity teams, Verbit — vertical AI, transcription.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nIt hasn’t slowed down, plenty of opportunity, you have to move fast.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nI don’t see the pandemic having that effect. Hubs will remain as are.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?\nAnything relying on on-prem slowed down; this can be semiconductors and retail. but it’s recovering.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nNot really, we invest the same amount into the same amount of companies at same stages as before.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes, deals are closing, financing is taking place as well as M&As.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nSimply lively investment atmosphere, new up rounds and several M&A processes emerging.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nCareful optimism, raise aggressively and cash up when possible, refresh the pipeline and get to it, corporates are back into closing deals.Tal Slobodkin, StageOne VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nCloud computing and\u200b software infrastructure\u200b/cybersecurity/DevOps/connected everything/deep compute, big data and AI/next-generation storage and data center.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nR-Go Robotics are pioneering an artificial perception technology that enables mobile robots to understand complex surroundings and operate autonomously just like humans.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t?

More than 50%? Less?\nIsrael 85%; USA 15% — always looking to expand in the U.S. market as well.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term?

They all adapted to the situation for both the short term and long run. They have continued to raise funds and some companies have even developed additional products to assist with COVID-19-related issues.Ayal Itzkoviz, managing partner, Pitango FirstWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nDisruption in traditional markets yearning innovation, such as retail, insurtech, logistics, etc.B2B2B: Companies no longer wish to build things they can buy. Buying key components of the product/software enables companies to focus on the innovation side. One example is Frontegg — the company provides a set of pre-built, essential SaaS product capabilities that can easily and seamlessly integrate within any new or existing SaaS application. This enables dev teams to focus on perfecting the truly differentiating and valuable features at the heart of their SaaS offering. Another viable example is Stripe and its offering in the payments market.Cyber: 2020 taught us many lessons, one of them is that tech is just getting more exciting as digital transformation is enhanced, and the other is that the digital revolution presents cyber challenges that didn’t exist before. This results in continued opportunities for disruption in this domain.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nFrontegg — a startup that transforms the way SaaS is being built, so that developers don’t need to develop nondifferentiating code and features. Frontegg provides a state of the art SaaS-as-a-service platform, perfectly integrated within the company’s stack and allowing it to do what it’s best at: building their own product. Frontegg is the first pre-built suite of universal SaaS capabilities, enabling teams to focus on core features, shorten time-to-market and drive user adoption. Frontegg’s mission is to accelerate the delivery of enterprise-grade SaaS applications while providing the safest, most secure and optimal user experience.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nFirst: more open-source projects. They do exist, but usually operate under the radar and come out of stealth mode when they’re already mature and beyond the phase of seed and stage on which Pitango First is focused.Quantum computing, in our view, has reached a point of no return. We’ll be happy to see entrepreneurs, scientists and business people in Israel jumping on the opportunity wagon already now, and build companies now, before the quantum market begins what will surely be an exponential growth.Lastly are startups with a double bottom line, i.e., startups that while solving a pain point in the market they’re in and have a potential to become category leader, also address an impact category. Pitango is the first VC to integrate ESG practices into its mainstream activities. As part of this strategy, and as a first step, we are focusing on our vast portfolio of companies and work closely with them to embedESG into their core practices through a “migration” process.Pitango aims to move the needle in the venture capital space through the “AND” philosophy: profit AND purpose, capital AND impact. Pitango is introducing a new paradigm of how venture capital does impact and integrates the “AND” philosophy by turning to a new opportunity set: the impact migrants. i.e., those startups that, although might not have been created under the SDG narrative, have the potential and a desire to embrace and track their impact. They will define their impact mission, integrate SDG targets within their business performance and track impact in alignment with financial targets, all without losing sight of their primary mission to deliver superior financial returns.Furthermore, Pitango applies this AND philosophy beyond its existing portfolio and onto future deal flow review. We call it the “mainstreaming” of impact investing.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nThe Israeli market has evolved tremendously in recent years. While the IPO market used to be out of reach for Israeli-born companies, this is no longer the case. We are looking for the visionaries, the dent blowers, the unconventional types who are eager to solve the biggest of challenges and are aiming at building an IPO-able business rather than an M&A one.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nPitango First is focused on Israeli/Israeli-related startups. From time to time we identify an investment opportunity in areas we have defined as strategic, in which the Israeli market isn’t mature enough and for which we believe we can add significant value and then invest in non-Israeli companies.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nIsrael is a super strong innovation hub. One of the major evolution trends of recent years is that the traditional glass ceiling that Israeli startups used to tackle has been shattered. Global players realize that now they can get the same upside like SV-based companies, in much more reasonable terms, and sometimes, less competition.\nSomewhat counterintuitively, we see the investment climate in these times of COVID-19 being extremely vibrant and competitive. Strong teams are raising significant rounds at record high valuations, which add up to the current belief that COVID-19 didn’t slow, but accelerated the digital transformation.What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nFor many seed early-stage startups that have secured funding, COVID-19 didn’t set setbacks in their plans, as they are further from the market from more mature companies. However, such companies, when backed by strong investors, while they may experience decrease in their revenues, are using this period to gain strength by acquiring companies within their ecosystem and position themselves better toward the out-of-pandemic curve that will eventually be here in a few short quarters.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nThe pattern of investing for the long run during the pandemic. Looking far into the horizon, as veterans of previous crises we were able to share our experience and insights and help them better deal with the crisis. Also, this question can’t be answered without mentioning the COVID-19 vaccines, which set a magnificent example to the extent humanity can benefit when tech, medical companies and governments join hands and engage in a group effort.Ittai Harel, managing partner, Pitango HealthTechWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nThe consumerization of healthcare.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nHomeThrive — a tech-enabled healthcare services company tackling the aging-in-home challenge and helping families help their loved ones age happily.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nAn all-star team building a category-defining or category-leading company with demonstrable clinical AND financial outcomes.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nNarrow wearables that do not integrate into a clinical or life workflow.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nPitango HealthTech is focused on Israeli/Israeli-related startups. From time to time we identify an investment opportunity in areas we have defined as strategic, in which the Israeli market isn’t mature enough and for which we believe we can add significant value, and then invest in non-Israeli companies.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nIsrael has many thriving healthcare sectors — from RPM and computer vision in digital health to cardiovascular in med devices to drug research in biotech and pharma. We are excited about our portfolio company Variantyx (a provider of whole genome sequencing and analytics unique platform solution) and Alike (a patient-facing platform to allow individuals to access and analyze their medical data and to connect to others similar to them). We are also excited to be part of this ecosystem and to lead thought leadership in it.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nThe healthcare innovation ecosystem in Israel is thriving. There are incredible entrepreneurs and opportunities with global potential and reach that global investors should be aware of.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nTo some extent we are witness more disbursement in Israel, but there is nonetheless a strong draw to co-locating in hubs and we expect to see Tel-Aviv and the central area in Israel to continue dominating in terms of attractiveness to strong teams.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?Hospitals have seen a drastic decline in elective procedures and an overall disruption to their operations and budgets. Startups that are able to introduce new technologies to make this shift efficient and painless stand to win from the current trend.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nFor the healthcare industry, COVID-19 has brought challenges — but also opportunities. We believe overall that our companies (and the industry overall) stand to gain from the shift as stakeholders are quicker to adopt changes that before took much longer. We advise our — and all — portfolio companies to prepare for the days after COVID and think through what changes in their specific segment will be long-lasting and are “here to stay.”What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nWhen the first individual in the U.K. — a 90-year-old woman — received the vaccine. A turning point hopefully for the entire world.']",Capsule,"['NavigationClose', 'Butcher@mikebutcher', 'Ilan Shacham', 'Getty ImagesIsrael’s', 'Mainstay', 'Extra Crunch', 'Boaz Dinte', 'Qumra CapitalRafi Carmeli', 'Viola GrowthYonatan Mandelbaum', 'TLV PartnersNatalie Refuah', 'Viola GrowthDaniel Cohen', 'Viola', 'VenturesBen', 'Jumpspeed VenturesInbal Perlman', 'TAU VenturesDavid', 'Dede', 'Samsung Catalyst', 'Nahumi', 'Norwest Venture PartnersSharin Fisher', 'VenturesAdi', 'Levanon Chazan', 'Flint CapitalChaim Meir Tessler', 'Kaiser', 'Intel CapitalTal Slobodkin', 'StageOne Ventures', 'FirstIttai Harel', 'Fiverr', 'Talkspace', 'AI', 'AppsFlyer', 'JoyTunes', 'Riskified', 'Talkspace', 'AppsFlyer', 'Oren Kaniel', 'ARR', 'JoyTunes', 'Yuval Kaminka', 'Pavel Gurevich', 'Eido Gal', 'Assaf Feldman', 'Talkspace', 'Oren', 'Roni Frank', 'VC', 'Augury', 'COVID-19', 'Qumra III', 'Rafi Carmeli', 'Viola', 'Zoomin Software', 'CFO', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'post-COVID', 'TechCrunch', 'done!Yonatan Mandelbaum', 'ML', 'Next', 'Riskified', 'Melio', 'VC', 'Next Insurance', 'Mesh Payments', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'WFH', 'WFH', 'Natalie Refuah', 'Viola', 'DevOps', 'DevOps', 'COVID-19', 'TechCrunch', 'Viola', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'COVID-19', 'Ben Wiener', 'Jumpspeed VenturesWhat', 'AI/ML', 'COVID-19', 'TechCrunch', 'W.

https://t.co/Sf2NztXHzM,2021-01-18T22:00:41,Singapore-based Volopay raises $2.1 million seed round to build a ‘financial control center’ for businesses,"['Volopay, a Singapore-based startup building a “financial control center” for businesses, announced today it has raised $2.1 million in seed funding. The round was led by Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen, and included participation from Soma Capital, CP Ventures, Y Combinator, VentureSouq, the founders of Razorpay, Antler and other angel investors.The funding will be used on hiring, product development, strategic partnerships and Volopay’s international expansion. It plans to launch operations in Australia later this month. The company currently has about 100 clients, including InVideo, Dathena, Medline, Sensorflow and Beam.Launched in 2019 by Rajith Shaiji and Rajesh Raikwar, Volopay took part in Y Combinator’s accelerator program last year. It was created after chief executive officer Shaji, who worked for several fintech companies before launching Volopay, became frustrated by the process of reconciling business expenses, especially with accounting departments located in different countries. Shaiji and Raikwar also saw that many companies, especially startups and SMEs, struggled to track different kinds of spending, including subscriptions and vendor payments.Singapore-based Volopay wants to be the ‘Brex of Southeast Asia’Most of Volopay’s clients are in the tech sector and have about 15 to 150 employees. Volopay’s platform integrates multicurrency corporate cards (issued by Visa Corporate), domestic and international bank transfers, automated payments and expense and accounting software, allowing companies to save money on foreign exchange fees and reconcile expenses more quickly.In order to speed up its development, Volopay integrated Airwallex’s APIs. Its corporate cards offer up to 2% cash back on software subscriptions, hosting and international travel, which Volopay says are the three top expense categories for tech companies, and it in November 2020, it launched a credit facility for corporate cards to help give SMEs more liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic.Compared to traditional credit products, like credit cards and working capital loans, Shaji said Volopay’s credit facility, which is also issued by Visa Corporate, has a more competitive fixed-free pricing structure that depends on the level of credit used. This means companies know how much they owe in advance, which in turn helps them manage their cashflows more easily. The average credit line provided by Volopay is about $30,000.Since TechCrunch last covered Volopay in July 2020, it has grown 70% month on month in terms of total funds flowing through its platform, Shaji said. It also launched two new features: A bill pay feature that allows clients to transfer money domestically and internationally with low foreign exchange rates and transaction fees, and the credit facility. The bill pay feature now contributes about 40% to Volopay’s total payment volume, while the credit product makes up 30% of its card spending.Shaji told TechCrunch that Volopay decided to expand into Australia because because not only is it a much larger market than Singapore, but “SMEs in Australia are very comfortable using paid digital software to streamline internal operations and scale their businesses.” He added that there is currently no other provider in Australia that offers both expense management and credit to SMEs like Volopay.Updated to add Antler as an investor.Here’s why so many fintech startups are loaning to small businesses']",proSapient,"['Volopay', 'NavigationClose', 'ScreenSingapore', 'Volopay', 'Volopay', 'window)Volopay', 'Justin Mateen', 'Soma Capital', 'CP Ventures', 'Y Combinator', 'VentureSouq', 'Antler', 'Volopay’s', 'Rajith Shaiji', 'Volopay', 'Volopay', 'Volopay', 'Volopay’s', 'Volopay’s', 'Visa Corporate', 'Volopay', 'Volopay', 'Shaji', 'Visa Corporate', 'Volopay', 'TechCrunch', 'Volopay', 'Shaji', 'Shaji', 'Volopay', 'Volopay', 'Antler', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCAustraliaFintechJustin', 'CombinatorSingapore', 'Volopay', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/iAbKSPZ9nQ,2021-01-18T20:47:14,Gillmor Gang: Twitter+,"['The best thing about 2020 is we survived it. No need to say what the worst thing is, it’s hands down our collective stupidity in the choices we’ve made. That reality has forced us to refactor what we do moving forward.If we had correctly understood the massive changes ahead, we would not be wondering when we will return to the old, new or any normal. The normal is what got us here. Unlimited air travel, freedom to do whatever we wanted without regard to the impact it would have on anybody else. Nationalism. What the hell is that all about? Keeping us in, everybody else out.Take Twitter for one. When it first emerged, it felt like a pipe dream realized. For me, it still feels that way. Good people like it, so do bad people. Bad as in they use the global network to inflict damage on their political enemies. Does that mean the phone is a bad thing, too? Or cars, or popcorn butter? What about dramas? They’re sad, reward winners and losers? Do I wish Hollywood was only allowed to make rom-coms? Well, yes I do.But only if it doesn’t abridge my rights, my freedom to pursue happiness. So when I see Twitter turn into a cesspool, I look for someone to blame. Let’s start with the bad guys. But what if they have a point about something? Their motives may be suspect, or just plain evil. What am I doing reading them anyway. It’s not like I chose them to follow. Well, apparently I did, by listening to people who retweet what these folks spew.Retweets are another one of these things I love about Twitter. Let’s say I follow someone whose perspective I admire, and they in turn retweet others who they admire. A social cloud forms with interesting characteristics. Implicitly, the pattern of retweets, @mentions and likes can be plugged into readers or aggregators to reflect trends, emerging news, business analytics, and social dynamics of power, ethics, humor and stature.So it’s not like a follow of the bad actors, but it is like I follow their relative position in the stream of those I follow. I can and do rationalize this monitoring of other than the chosen social group as a necessary early warning system for trouble ahead. These signals can be used prophylactically to measure how our message is carrying, but a typical impact is to pigeonhole our views as fodder for those who wish us ill.Net net, this countervailing energy reduces the sense of fun I have with the global network. If I had to choose no Twitter over this problem, I still choose Twitter. In the early days of social media, I had a front row seat in observing how these little signals could have a surprising impact on the concerns of the day, on the projection of ideas around the network to and with others who together built support, and sometimes, business through the collective group mind.Has this been lost in the partisan nature of our daily political noise? Of course, just try saying anything about anything and watch the nasty trolls rev up their schtick. Not fun. Also not effective, because the pushback creates a new rhythm of Pee Wee Herman yeah-but-what-am-I dynamics. What to do? How about a @botmention that argues with tagged trolls but silently removes the noise from the feeds of those who @like the @bot tag.Implementing this semi-public stream is already doable inside a private network, with the “cost” of joining the agreement to provide access to an internal view that makes the stream less noisy and more responsive. We’ve been experimenting with just such a private/public backchannel to support production of the Gillmor Gang, but I’m not here to promote that. More usefully, the network functions efficiently in concert with Twitter.The events of 2020, and the years leading up to the election and pandemic breakout, make clear that the kind of social media spread we have seen has consequences we should have countered but in fact exacerbated. Yet even in the volatile wind down of the election are some signs of a rebound from playing the chaos card. Whatever you think of Twitter’s history of or lack of backbone development, Jack Dorsey’s red line in the sand was a much needed call to arms against Trump’s bullying.Even if the actual technology was limited in effect, the application of any pushback at all was a signal of what the world might look like if the election went the other way. The first amplification of that subtle shift came from social media’s biggest customer, mainstream media: pointed pushback in White House press conferences, silent movie montages of Republican senators refusing to answer shouted hallway questions, networks cutting away from events when the falsehood level reached fake mass.Mitch McConnell’s move to tie additional stimulus help to Trump’s attempt to punish Twitter by repealing Section 230 protection proved effective in running out the clock. It also moved the ball from Trump’s control to the hard numbers of January 20. The Georgia runoff on January 5, followed the next day by the attempt to challenge the electoral college Biden win and the storming of the Capitol, changed everything. Twitter became Trump’s last super power. Note: This edition of the Gang was recorded minutes before Twitter permanently suspended the @realDonaldTrump account.Well, there is Zoom too. Its swappable background feature lets the ex-resident broadcast to the faithful as though nothing has changed. That’s why he came back from vacation early, to pre-pardon his production staff and hire a shadow cabinet. Secretary of Streaming, Chief Acting Legal Officer, Secretary of Horror Stephen Miller, Secretary of Bacteria Giuliani.Zoom lets you do this behind a subscription paywall, but now Trump+ is competing against Disney+, Netflix, Apple+ and the bundles designed to lock-in the market until the vaccines take root. Or how about an ACA+ bundle that gives you preexisting coverage, the latest iPhone and any three + networks on a rotating basis to encourage competition for stream retention.from the  Gillmor Gang Newsletter__________________The Gillmor Gang — Frank Radice, Michael Markman, Keith Teare, Denis Pombriant, Brent Leary and Steve Gillmor.

https://t.co/hpJx1RrvOq,2021-01-18T20:06:11,Cryptocat author gets insanely fast backing to build P2P tech for social media,"[""The idea for Capsule started with a tweet about reinventing social media.A day later cryptography researcher, Nadim Kobeissi — best known for authoring the open-source E2E-encrypted desktop chat app Cryptocat (now discontinued) — had pulled in a pre-seed investment of $100,000 for his lightweight mesh-networked microservices concept, with support coming from angel investor and\xa0former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, William J. Pulte and Wamda Capital.I'm designing a decentralized social media solution where each user hosts their own microservice. These then connect to one another in a mesh, allowing following and sharing posts. It will be lightweight, user friendly and secure.Are you interested in funding its development?— Nadim Kobeissi (@kaepora) January 10, 2021The nascent startup has a post-money valuation on paper of $10 million, according to Kobeissi, who is working on the prototype — hoping to launch an MVP of Capsule in March (as a web app), after which he intends to raise a seed round (targeting $1 million-$1.5 million) to build out a team and start developing mobile apps.For now there’s nothing to see beyond Capsule’s landing page and a pitch deck (which he shared with TechCrunch for review). But Kobeissi says he was startled by the level of interest in the concept.“I posted that tweet and the expectation that I had was that basically 60 people max would retweet it and then maybe I’ll set up a Kickstarter,” he tells us. Instead the tweet “just completely exploded” and he found himself raising $100,000 “in a single day” — with $50,000 paid in there and then.“I’m not a startup guy. I’ve been running a business based on consulting and based on academic R&D services,” he continues. “But by the end of the day — last Sunday, eight days ago — I was running a Delaware corporation valued at $10 million with $100,000 in pre-seed funding, which is insane. Completely insane.”Capsule is just the latest contender for retooling Internet power structures by building infrastructure that radically decentralizes social platforms to make speech more resilient to corporate censorship and control.The list of decentralized/P2P/federated protocols and standards already out there is very long — even while usage remains low. Extant examples include ActivityPub, Diaspora, Mastodon, P2P Matrix, Scuttlebutt, Solid and Urbit, to name a few.Interest in the space has been rekindled in recent weeks after mainstream platforms like Facebook and Twitter took decisions to shut down U.S. President Donald Trump’s access to their megaphones — a demonstration of private power that other political leaders have described as problematic.\xa0Kobeissi also takes that view, while adding the caveat that he’s not “personally” concerned about Trump’s deplatforming. But he says he is concerned about giant private corporations having unilateral power to shape internet speech — whether takedown decisions are being made by Twitter’s trust and safety lead or Amazon Web Services (which recently yanked the plug on right-wing social network Parler for failing to moderate violent views).He also points to a lawsuit that’s been filed in U.S. court seeking damages and injunctive relief from Apple for allowing Telegram, a messaging platform with 500 million+ users, to be made available through its iOS App Store — “despite Apple’s knowledge that Telegram is being used to intimidate, threaten and coerce members of the public” — raising concerns about “the odds of these efforts catching on.”“That is kind of terrifying,” he suggests.The deplatforming of President TrumpCapsule would seek to route around the risk of mass deplatforming via “easy to deploy” P2P microservices — starting with a forthcoming web app.“When you deploy Capsule right now — I have a prototype that does almost nothing running — it’s basically one binary. And you get that binary and you deploy it and you run it, and that’s it. It sets up a server, it contacts Let’s Encrypt, it gets you a certificate, it uses SQLite for the database, which is a serverless database, all of the assets for the web server are within the binary,” he says, walking through the “really nice technical idea” that snagged $100,000 in pre-seed backing insanely fast.“There are no other files — and then once you have it running, in that folder when you set up your capsule server, it’s just the Capsule program and a Capsule database that is a file. And that’s it. And that is so self-contained that it’s embeddable everywhere, that’s migratable — and it’s really quite impossible to get this level of simplicity and elegance so quickly unless you go this route. Then, for the mesh federation thing, we’re just doing HTTPS calls and then having decentralized caching of the databases and so on.”Among the Twitter back-and-forth about how (or whether) Kobeissi’s concept differs to various other decentralized protocols, someone posted a link to this XKCD cartoon — which lampoons the techie quest to resolve competing standards by proposing a tech that covers all use cases (yet is of course doomed to increase complexity by +1). So given how many protocols already offer self-hosted/P2P social media services it seems fair to ask what’s different here — and, indeed, why build another open decentralized standard?Kobeissi argues that existing options for decentralizing social media are either: (a) not fully P2P (Mastodon is “self-hosted but not decentralized,” per a competitive analysis on Capsule’s pitch deck, ergo its servers are “vulnerable to Parler-style AWS takedowns”); or (b) not focused enough on the specific use case of social media (some other decentralized protocols like Matrix aim to support many more features/apps than social media and therefore can’t be as lightweight is the argument); or (c) simply aren’t easy enough to use to be more than a niche geeky option.He talks about Capsule having the same level of focus on social media as Signal does on private messaging, for example — albeit intending it to support both short-form “tweet”-style public posts and long-form Medium-style postings. But he’s vocal about not wanting any “bloat.”Automattic pumps $4.6M into New Vector to help grow Matrix, an open, decentralized comms ecosystemHe also invokes Apple’s “design for usability” philosophy. Albeit, it’s a lot easier to say you want to design something that “just works” versus actually pulling off effortless mainstream accessibility. But that’s the bar Kobeissi is setting himself here.“I always imagine Glenn Greenwald when I think of my user,” he says on the usability point, referring to the outspoken journalist and Intercept co-founder who recently left to launch his own newsletter-based offering on Substack. “He’s the person I see setting this up. Basically the way that this would work is he’d be able to set this up or get someone to set it up really easily — I think Capsule is going to offer automated deployments as also a way to make revenue, by the way, i.e., for a bit extra we deploy the server for you and then you’re self-hosting but we also make a margin off of that — but it’s going to be open source, you can set it up yourself as well and that’s perfectly okay. It’s not going to be hindered at all in that sense.“In the case of Capsule, each content creator has their own website — has their own address, like Capsule.Greenwald.com — and then people go there and their first discovery of the mesh is through people that they’re interested in hearing from.”Individual Capsules would be decentralized from the risk of platform-level censorship since they’d be beyond the reach of takedowns by a single centralizing entity. Although they would still be hosted on the web — and therefore could be subject to a takedown by their own web host. That means illegal speech on Capsule could still be removed. However there wouldn’t be a universal host that could be hit up with the risk of a whole platform being taken down at a sweep — as Parler just was by AWS.“For every takedown it is entirely between that Capsule user and their hosting provider,” says Kobeissi. “Capsule users are going to have different hosting providers that they’re able to choose and then every time that there is a takedown it is going to be a decision that is made by a different entity. And with a different — perhaps — judgement, so there isn’t this centralized focus where only Amazon Web Services decides who gets to speak or only Twitter decides.”And while the business of web hosting at platform giant level involves just a handful of cloud hosting giants able to offer the required scalability, he argues that that censorship-prone market concentration goes away once you’re dealing with scores of descentralized social media instances.\xa0 \xa0“We have the big hosting providers — like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud — but aside from that we have a lot of tiny hosting providers or small businesses … Sure if you’re running a big business you do get to focus on these big providers because they allow you to have these insane servers that are very powerful and deployable very easily but if you’re running a Capsule instance, as a matter of fact, the server resource requirements of running a Capsule instance are generally speaking quite small. In most instances tiny.”Content would also be harder to scrub from Capsule because the mesh infrastructure would mean posts get mirrored across the network by the poster’s own followers (assuming they have any). So, for example, reposts wouldn’t just vanish the moment the original poster’s account was taken down by their hosting provider. Separate takedown requests would likely be needed to scrub each reposted instance, adding a lot more friction to the business of content moderation versus the unilateral takedowns that platform giants can rain down now. The aim is to “spare the rest of the community from the danger of being silenced,” as Kobeissi puts it.Trump’s deplatforming does seem to have triggered a major penny-dropping moment for some that allowing a handful of corporate giants to own and operate centralized mass communication machines isn’t exactly healthy for democratic societies as this unilateral control of infrastructure gives them the power to limit speech. (As, indeed, their content-sorting algorithms determine reach and set the agenda of much public debate.)Current social media infrastructure also provides a few mainstream chokepoints for governments to lean on — amplifying the risk of state censorship.With concerns growing over the implications of platform power on data flows — and judging by how quickly Kobeissi’s tweet turned heads — we could be on the cusp of an investor-funded scramble to retool internet infrastructure to redefine where power (and data) lies.It’s certainly interesting to note that Twitter recently reupped its own decentralized social media open standard push, Bluesky, for example. It obviously wouldn’t want to be left behind any such shift.“It seems to really have blown up,” Kobeissi adds, returning to his week-old Capsule concept. “I thought when I tweeted that I was maybe the only person who cared. I guess I live in France so I’m not really in tune with what’s going on in the U.S. a lot — but a lot of people care.”“I am not like a cypherpunk-style person these days, I’m not for full anonymity or full unaccountability online by any stretch,” he adds. “And if this is abused then sincerely it might even be the case that we would encourage — have a guidelines page — for hosting providers like on how to deal with instances of someone hosting an abusive Capsule instance. We do want that accountability to exist. We are not like a full-on, crazy town ‘free speech’ wild west thing. We just think that that accountability has to be organic and decentralized — just as originally intended with the internet.”Twitter’s decentralized future""]",Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox,"['NavigationClose', 'Lomas@riptari /', 'Capsule', 'Nadim Kobeissi', 'Cryptocat', 'William J.

How do you “suck their brains” for information in an efficient manner, whether it be for research into companies or sectors, often for investment purposes. Major players in this arena include GLG, Third Bridge, Guidepoint and Alphasights. With the pandemic destroying many means of hearing experts — conferences and events for instance — and turning the entire world into a remote-working experiment, platforms like these are now far more relevant than they ever were before.So it’s perhaps unsurprising that the expert network and primary research platform, proSapient, has now closed a $10 million Series A investment led by Smedvig Capital. Noted high-profile investor Guy Hands and existing investors 24 Haymarket also participated in the round. This brings the total raised by proSapient to date to $18 million. The company will use the cash to expand internationally.proSapient is essentially a SaaS platform for managing expert networks. It’s aimed mainly at investors and consultants to gather data. The platform matches experts to projects and provides transcripts. You can gather insight over the phone or in-person; launch bespoke surveys; conduct small strategy projects with a small group of experts. You can search, filter messaging and also collaborate internally on the platform. It now claims to be servicing over 100 clients across Europe and the USA, with revenue up over 100% year on year.Margo Polishchuk, co-founder of proSapient, said in a statement: “This funding round will facilitate our strategic objective of being a leading primary research platform for the private equity and consulting sectors.”Rob Toms, managing director at Smedvig Capital, commented:\xa0“We’re excited to be working with Margo and Jordan to continue their impressive growth and international expansion.

Image Credits: MercedesMaybe it was the virtual format, but autonomous vehicle technology didn’t play a starring role at CES this year as it has in the past.Instead, several other themes emerged at CES, mostly around infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems. And continuing a trend in 2020, there were several gigantic screens, including the Mercedes Hyperscreen that is pictured above.Pioneer, Harman and Panasonic all revealed future products aimed at bringing more audio and visual technology into the vehicle. Harman, for instance, unveiled three new “experience concepts” that can turn the infotainment system in a vehicle into a concert hall, recording studio or gaming center.Panasonic also announced a partnership with U.K. startup Envisics to jointly develop and commercialize a new generation of head-up displays for cars, trucks and SUVs. Head-up displays, or HUDs, seemed to be everywhere this show. The technology isn’t new, but recent advances are pushing the capabilities of these systems, which are integrated in the dash of a vehicle and project images onto the windshield to aid drivers with navigation and provide other alerts.Image Credits: EnvisicsGM had perhaps the biggest presence at the virtual 2021 CES, at least within the transportation sector. The automaker chose the tech trade show to announce a new business unit called BrightDrop that will focus on electric vans and other products and services for the commercial market. But that wasn’t all.GM used the opportunity to tease its upcoming Chevrolet Bolt EUV — a vehicle that will have GM’s hands-free highway driving assist technology known as Super Cruise — as well as the Cadillac Celestiq dashboard and even a new logo. The intent of this bouquet of announcements was clear: GM wants the world — and shareholders — to know it’s serious about electrification and connected car tech.GM’s numerous announcements were hard to miss — there was even an eVTOL. Conversely, Mobileye’s announcements flew a bit under the radar, but are arguably as notable.\xa0GM showed off two concepts at CES 2021: an autonomous shuttle and a personal eVTOL. Image Credits: GMMobileye outlined plans to expand its autonomous vehicles testing to more cities, which was expected and is in line with the company’s previously stated plans.What stood out to me was a talk that Mobileye president and CEO Amnon Shashua gave that outlined the company’s vision and progress.The recap: Mobileye is taking a three-pronged strategy to developing and deploying automated vehicle technology that combines a full self-driving stack — that includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology— with its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy.Mobileye’s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into nearly one million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support ADAS and autonomous driving systems. Shashua said Mobileye’s technology can now map the world automatically with nearly eight million kilometers tracked daily and nearly one billion kilometers completed to date.The company provided more details at CES about a new lidar system-on-a-chip product that is under development and will come to market in 2025.

https://t.co/o7idVv7QdC,2021-01-18T16:43:08,"It may not be as glamorous as D2C, but beauty tech is big money","['Sindhya ValloppillilContributorShare on Twitter Sindhya Valloppillil is the founder and CEO of Skin Dossier, a venture partner at Next Gen Ventures, a freelance writer and formerly a beauty industry executive and marketing professor.\r\n\r\n\tLast week, Procter & Gamble (P&G) announced that it was terminating plans to acquire razor startup Billie following a U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit to stop the deal.Last year, Edgewell Personal Care ditched its debt-heavy $1.37 billion deal for Harry’s, Inc, formerly valued at $1 billion after the FTC sought to block the acquisition.In addition to these FTC challenges, it is also now becoming clear that relying on VC-subsidized products and celebrating outrageous valuations can be problematic for D2C brands. With a few wonderful and rare exceptions such as Rothy’s (which raised $42 million but was profitable from the beginning and generated $140 million in revenue within two years of launching), D2C unicorns are addicted to the cycle of venture funding to feed growth in order to maintain a high valuation multiple. \n\t\t\tThe path to profitability has become a more important part of the startup story versus growth at all costs.\t\t\t\t\tThis works for a while; however, when the path to profitability appears murky and exit options either don’t appear or only appear from nontech companies with very conservative multiples, the walls start crumbling.In a WWD article, Odile Roujol, the former CEO of Lancôme who launched venture fund\xa0FAB Ventures, said, “Generally speaking, the era of $1 billion valuations for beauty companies is over. The people that struggle have been the companies that spend so much money in just a few years.” She went on to say, “The big corporations now … are not ready to spend $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion on such a brand like Glossier.”This change in sentiment from acquirers is further fueled by recent research on the challenges of turning hypergrowth companies profitable. In his Harvard Business School case study “Direct to Consumer Brands,” Professor Sunil Gupta wrote, “Acquiring DTC brands is easy for incumbent conglomerates, but making them profitable is challenging. More than three years after Unilever acquired Dollar Shave Club, it was still unprofitable.”Unilever executives learned that the average cost of acquiring a new customer online was about the same as in stores. David Taylor, CEO of P&G, said his company was still figuring out how to turn recently acquired direct-to-consumer brands into profitable businesses.Taylor summarized this dilemma, saying, “There are many, many launches that grow fast … a business model that makes money is a higher challenge.” Since making these realizations, incumbent conglomerates will be more cautious when considering the acquisition of hyped D2C brands that raised lots of venture capital.Beauty tech is a better bet: Meitu and Perfect Corp.What’s cooler than beauty companies that are (or were) valued at $1 billion? Beauty tech SaaS companies that are worth $5.2 billion at IPO. We don’t hear much about the leading global beauty tech companies such as Meitu and Perfect Corp. because their founders are not celebrity influencers, they don’t have massive Instagram followings here in the U.S. and they are not celebrated in our media. Although their companies are based in Asia and they raised money mostly from Chinese investors, their companies are global successes.']",its launch,"['Twitter Sindhya Valloppillil', 'Skin Dossier', 'Next Gen Ventures', 'Procter & Gamble', 'P&G', 'Billie', 'U.S. Federal Trade Commission', 'Edgewell Personal Care', 'Harry’s', 'FTC', 'FTC', 'VC', 'D2C', 'Rothy’s', 'WWD', 'Odile Roujol', 'Lancôme', 'FAB Ventures', 'Glossier', 'Harvard Business School', 'DTC', 'Unilever', 'Dollar Shave Club', 'David Taylor', 'P&G', 'Taylor', 'Perfect Corp.', 'Meitu and Perfect Corp.', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'clubEC Market MapPerfect Corpprocter &', 'Valloppillil5:43', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/K9DudkE4xl,2021-01-17T17:53:48,Threat of inauguration violence casts a long shadow over social media,"['As the U.S. heads into one of the most perilous phases of American democracy since the Civil War, social media companies are scrambling to shore up their patchwork defenses for a moment they appear to have believed would never come.Most major platforms pulled the emergency brake last week, deplatforming the president of the United States and enforcing suddenly robust rules against conspiracies, violent threats and undercurrents of armed insurrection, all of which proliferated on those services for years. But within a week’s time, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Google had all made historic decisions in the name of national stability — and appearances. Snapchat, TikTok, Reddit and even Pinterest took their own actions to prevent a terror plot from being hatched on their platforms.Now, we’re in the waiting phase. More than a week after a deadly pro-Trump riot invaded the iconic seat of the U.S. legislature, the internet still feels like it’s holding its breath, a now heavily fortified inauguration ceremony looming ahead.Image Credits: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat’s still out thereOn the largest social network of all, images hyping follow-up events continued to circulate midweek. One digital Facebook flyer promoted an “armed march on Capitol Hill and all state Capitols,” pushing the dangerous and false conspiracy that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.Facebook says that it’s working to identify flyers calling for “Stop the Steal” adjacent events using digital fingerprinting, the same process it uses to remove terrorist content from ISIS and al-Qaida. The company noted that it has seen flyers calling for events on January 17 across the country, January 18 in Virginia and Inauguration Day in D.C.At least some of Facebook’s new efforts are working: One popular flyer TechCrunch observed on the platform was removed from some users’ feeds this week. A number of “Stop the Steal” groups we’d observed over the last month also unceremoniously blinked offline early this week following more forceful action from the company. Still, given the writing on the wall, many groups had plenty of time to tweak their names by a few words or point followers elsewhere to organize.With only days until the presidential transition, acronym-heavy screeds promoting QAnon, an increasingly mainstream collection of outrageous pro-Trump government conspiracy theories, also remain easy to find. On one page with 2,500 followers, a QAnon believer pushed the debunked claim that anti-fascists executed the attack on the Capitol, claiming “January 6 was a trap.”Image Credits: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesOn a different QAnon group, an ominous post from an admin issued Congress a warning: “We have found a way to end this travesty! YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED!” The elaborate conspiracy’s followers were well represented at the deadly riot at the Capitol, as the many giant “Q” signs and esoteric T-shirt slogans made clear.In a statement to TechCrunch about the state of extremism on the platform, Facebook says it is coordinating with terrorism experts as well as law enforcement “to prevent direct threats to public safety.” The company also noted that it works with partners to stay aware of violent content taking root on other platforms.Facebook’s efforts are late and uneven, but they’re also more than the company has done to date. Measures from big social networks coupled with the absence of far-right social networks like Parler and Gab have left Trump’s most ardent supporters once again swearing off Silicon Valley and fanning out for an alternative.Twitter’s decentralized futureSocial media migrationPrivate messaging apps Telegram and Signal are both seeing an influx of users this week, but they offer something quite different from a Facebook or Twitter-like experience. Some expert social network observers see the recent migration as seasonal rather than permanent.“The spike in usage of messaging platforms like Telegram and Signal will be temporary,” Yonder CEO Jonathon Morgan told TechCrunch. “Most users will either settle on platforms with a social experience, like Gab, MeWe or Parler, if it returns, or will migrate back to Twitter and Facebook.”That company uses AI to track how social groups connect online and what they talk about — violent conspiracies included. Morgan believes that propaganda-spreading “performative internet warriors” make a lot of noise online, but a performance doesn’t work without an audience. Others may quietly pose a more serious threat.“The different types of engagement we saw during the assault on the Capitol mirror how these groups have fragmented online,” Morgan said. “We saw a large mob who was there to cheer on the extremists but didn’t enter the Capitol, performative internet warriors taking selfies, and paramilitaries carrying flex cuffs (mislabeled as ‘zip ties’ in a lot of social conversation), presumably ready to take hostages.“Most users (the mob) will be back on Parler if it returns, and in the meantime, they are moving to other apps that mimic the social experience of Twitter and Facebook, like MeWe.”Still, Morgan says that research shows “deplatforming” extremists and conspiracy-spreaders is an effective strategy and efforts by “tech companies from Airbnb to AWS” will reduce the chances of violence in the coming days.Cleaning up platforms can help turn the masses away from dangerous views, he explained, but the same efforts might further galvanize people with an existing intense commitment to those beliefs. With the winds shifting, already heterogeneous groups will be scattered too, making their efforts desperate and less predictable.Twitter’s decentralized futureDeplatforming works, with risksJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told TechCrunch that social media companies still need to do much more to prepare for inauguration week. “We saw platforms fall short in their response to the Capitol insurrection,” Greenblatt said.He cautioned that while many changes are necessary, we should be ready for online extremism to evolve into a more fractured ecosystem. Echo chambers may become smaller and louder, even as the threat of “large scale” coordinated action diminishes.“The fracturing has also likely pushed people to start communicating with each other via encrypted apps and other private means, strengthening the connections between those in the chat and providing a space where people feel safe openly expressing violent thoughts, organizing future events and potentially plotting future violence,” Greenblatt said.By their own standards, social media companies have taken extraordinary measures in the U.S. in the last two weeks. But social networks have a long history of facilitating violence abroad, even as attention turns to political violence in America.Greenblatt’s repeated calls for companies to hire more human moderators, a suggestion often made by experts focused on extremism. He believes social media could still take other precautions for inauguration week, like introducing a delay into livestreams or disabling them altogether, bolstering rapid response teams and suspending more accounts temporarily rather than focusing on content takedowns and handing out “strikes.”“Platforms have provided little to nothing in the way of transparency about learnings from last week’s violent attack in the Capitol,” Greenblatt said.“We know the bare minimum of what they ought to be doing and what they are capable of doing. If these platforms actually provided transparency and insights, we could offer additional — and potentially significantly stronger — suggestions.”Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence']","reaching space and orbit, but also of delivering payloads on board for NASA","['Amazon', 'Twitter', 'Apple', 'Google', 'TikTok', 'pro-Trump', 'Capitol Hill', 'Capitols', 'ISIS', 'al-Qaida', 'QAnon', 'QAnon', 'QAnon', 'Congress', 'Facebook', 'Parler', 'Gab', 'Trump’s', 'Twitter’s', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'Jonathon Morgan', 'Gab', 'Parler', 'AI', 'Morgan', 'Capitol', 'Morgan', 'Parler', 'Morgan', 'Twitter’s', 'Greenblatt', 'the Anti-Defamation League', 'Greenblatt', 'Greenblatt', 'Greenblatt’s', 'Greenblatt', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Taylor Hatmaker6:53', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/o0wvRDldXL,2021-01-18T15:31:55,Bustle CEO Bryan Goldberg explains his plans for taking the company public,"['Bustle Digital Group — owner of Bustle, Inverse, Input, Mic and other titles — could eventually join the ranks of startups going public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).During an interview about the state of BDG and the digital media industry at the end of 2020, founder and CEO Bryan Goldberg laid out ambitious goals for the next few years.“Where do I want to see the company in three years? I want to see three things: I want to be public, I want to see us driving a lot of profits and I want it to be a lot bigger, because we’ve consolidated a lot of other publications,” he said.He added that those goals connect, because by going public, BDG can raise “hundreds of millions dollars,” which Goldberg wants to use to “buy a lot of media companies.”That might seem like bluster after a year in which many digital media companies (including BDG) had to make serious cuts. But Goldberg said that the company would be profitable in 2020, with revenue that’s “a little bit under $100 million.” And it won’t be the first digital media company to take a similar route — Group Nine created a SPAC that went public last week.“I want to prove that we can be highly profitable,” he said. “A lot of startups don’t have that goal. A lot of VCs tell their startups: Don’t worry about profits, don’t worry about losing money. I don’t believe in that.”In addition to his plans to go public, Goldberg also discussed how acquisitions have helped Bustle’s business, his joint venture to purchase W Magazine and digital media’s “overcapitalization” problem. You can read our full conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.TechCrunch: The last time I caught up with someone at BDG, it was with [the company’s president Jason Wagenheim] and that was when you guys were dealing with the initial fallout [from the pandemic]. Now we’re a lot further into whatever this new world is, so what is your sense of where BDG is now, versus where it was in the early days of the pandemic?Bryan Goldberg: It might be the craziest, most eventful six months for many of us in our lives. And certainly, for those of us in this industry, the difference between April and October, it’s really hard to fathom, it’s complete night and day. April was a very frightening time for everyone, personally and professionally across the country, across the world.From an advertising standpoint, it was a really scary time, because we have clients across every industry, and every industry was impacted differently. We have clients who were greatly impacted — theme parks, car makers, hotel companies, airlines — and then we had clients who were not as badly affected, such as a lot of CPG clients, who everybody depended upon so much during the pandemic.There was a huge pause in our business in in March, April and May. For a lot of clients, tossing advertising was a sort of knee-jerk reaction to the sudden shock of COVID, and so we saw a huge negative impact in our second quarter. What we started to see in the third quarter, and especially now in the fourth quarter, is now that the shock of COVID is behind us, the macro trends that were catalyzed by COVID are now moving into the forefront.The story of media is no longer about the shock of COVID. The story of media is now about all of the changes to our world, and changes to our industry that were brought about as a consequence of COVID.The good news for our company, and the good news for other digital media companies, is it looks like the future is being accelerated. It looks like people are watching less television, and so advertisers are moving their budgets into digital faster than they would have had it not been for COVID. Even things like live sports, [their] TV ratings are way down. And a lot of advertisers are saying, “Is there efficacy anymore in cable television or broadcast television?” And the magazine industry was heavily impaired, simply because magazines are a physical medium, and people didn’t want to pass around magazines or read magazines at the dentist’s office, so we probably saw some print budget move into digital as well.Industry analysts now are going to take up their estimates of what digital revenue is going to look like in 2021, 2022 and beyond. I also think we’ve seen a world in which a lot of brand advertisers are starting to think about what happens when they start to spend beyond Facebook and Google. For most of the last three years, there’s been so much talk about the duopoly, the idea that Facebook and Google are going to eat almost every last dollar of advertising. What we’ve seen in the last three months is advertisers saying that this needs to be the moment in which they learn how to deploy advertising spend digitally beyond Facebook or Google.No, it doesn’t mean they’re all pulling out of Facebook — Facebook and Google are doing just fine. But there are still tens of billions of dollars that need to be deployed outside of Facebook and Google. And you’re seeing winners such as Snapchat, Pinterest. Both had incredibly strong earnings. They’re benefiting from the same thing that benefits Bustle Digital Group and a lot of other digital media players who aren’t Facebook and Google, which is you’re seeing big ad spenders finally deciding that now’s the time to find other ways to deploy advertising spend.I think those are the two big trends: Dollars moving to digital out of TV faster than we thought, and major advertisers using now as a time to find other channels beyond Facebook and Google.So when you look at how that is impacting Bustle’s business, has it returned to pre-COVID levels?For us, when we reflect upon the year 2020, we see that we had a great first quarter, we see that we’re having an incredible fourth quarter, and we have a big, epic crater in the second and third quarters. So when we look at the year, we basically have to say to ourselves, if it were not for that crater in the second and third quarters, what would this year have looked like? We would have had revenue well in excess of $100 million. Now, we’re gonna have revenue a little bit under $100 million.But when we think about how we prepare for 2021 and set goals for 2021, we have to set goals for 2021 as though COVID had never happened, we have to set goals for 2021 without using Q2 and Q3 as a sort of excuse for lowering expectations. Because the fourth quarter, the quarter we’re currently in, has exceeded our wildest expectations.People sort of sat up and took notice of the company because you had a pretty aggressive acquisition strategy. I imagine that strategy had to change a little bit in 2020. To what extent do you feel that ambition is something that you can pick up again?So to be clear, not only do we feel great about our strategy, our strategy was critical in helping our company survive and ultimately thrive in the wake of the virus. You know, we made two acquisitions [in 2019] — in the science and technology category, we bought Inverse, which is a science and technology publication, and then Josh Topolsky launched a tech-and-gadget publication for us called Input Magazine that’s growing very quickly.It’s critical that we had that strategy, because no single advertiser category has performed better for us in 2020 than tech — we more than tripled our revenue from technology clients this year, because technology has thrived through COVID. Had we not had an acquisition strategy, had we not diversified into tech media publishing, we certainly would not have had the outcome we had in 2020. That’s just the reality.Categories like beauty, fashion, retail were very hard hit. Those have traditionally been our bread and butter, and they’re going to be great again, in 2021. But this spring, beauty companies weren’t doing so well, because people weren’t leaving the house. So the strategy worked, in part, because we diversified the categories in which we created content, which allowed us to diversify the advertiser base. And we’re gonna continue full speed ahead in 2021.Now, you know, we did six acquisitions in 2019. I don’t know if we’ll do six acquisitions in 2021. But I want to do a lot more than one acquisition in 2021.']","$550,000 fine last month","['Bryan Goldberg', 'Bryan Goldberg', 'Bustle Digital GroupBustle Digital Group', 'BDG', 'Bryan Goldberg', 'BDG', 'Goldberg', 'Goldberg', 'W Magazine', 'BDG', 'Jason Wagenheim', 'BDG', 'CPG', 'Bustle Digital Group', 'Q3', 'Josh Topolsky', 'Input Magazine', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Digital GroupBuzzfeedInverseJason WagenheimmediaMarket Analysisextra-crunch-', 'Bryan Goldberg', 'Anthony Ha4:31', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Dailyhunt, which last month raised $100 million from Google, Microsoft and AlphaWave among others, in comparison, claims to reach over 285 million users each day.Unlike Twitter, Dailyhunt is also popular in smaller Indian cities and towns. The Indian social app, which serves users in 14 local languages, termed its partnership with Twitter as its “biggest collaboration” to date. The companies did not disclose financial terms of the deal.“At Twitter, we are committed to doing what we can to ensure people can keep up with what the world is talking about at any given time. Moments — a curated set of Tweets about a particular topic — are a powerful way to do so. With this partnership with Dailyhunt, a platform that caters to diverse languages and readers from all parts of India, we are thrilled to extend Twitter Moments to the Dailyhunt app,” said Manish Maheshwari, managing director of Twitter India, in a statement. (Twitter is also an investor in Indian social app ShareChat, which in some ways, competes with Dailyhunt.)Umang Bedi, co-founder of Dailyhunt and former head of Facebook India, said, “the past year has shown us the power of public opinion and awareness and it is incumbent upon us to mobilize this discourse by making information more accessible, more reliable and more engaging.

The launch was a success in every possible regard, which puts Virgin Orbit on track to become an active launch provider for small payloads for both commercial and defense customers.Today's sequence of events for #LaunchDemo2 went exactly to plan, from safe execution of our ground ops all the way through successful full duration burns on both engines. To say we're thrilled would be a massive understatement, but 240 characters couldn't do it justice anyway. pic.twitter.com/ZKpoi7hkGN— Virgin Orbit (@Virgin_Orbit) January 18, 2021Above, you can watch the actual launch itself — the moment the LauncherOne rocket detaches from “Cosmic Girl,” a modified Boeing 747 airliner that takes off normally from a standard aircraft runway, and then climbs to a cruising altitude to release the rocket, which then ignites its own engines and flies the rest of the way to space. Virgin Orbit’s launch model was designed to reduce the barriers to carrying small payloads to orbit versus traditional vertical takeoff vehicles, and this successful test flight proves the model works.Virgin Orbit now joins a small but growing group of private launch companies who have actually reached space and made it to orbit. That should be great news for the small satellite launch market, which still has much more demand than there is supply. Virgin Orbit also offers something very different from current launch providers like SpaceX, which typically serves larger payloads or which must offer rideshare model missions for those with smaller spacecraft. The LauncherOne design potentially means more on-demand, response and quick-turnaround launch services for satellite operators.Virgin Orbit reaches orbit for the first time""]",Samsung vice chairman Jay Y.

https://t.co/9qPsPvdiPQ,2021-01-18T12:33:02,WhatsApp-Facebook data-sharing transparency under review by EU DPAs after Ireland sends draft decision,"['A long-running investigation in the European Union focused on the transparency of data-sharing between Facebook and WhatsApp has taken the first major step toward a resolution. Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) confirmed Saturday it sent a draft decision to fellow EU DPAs toward the back end of last year.This will trigger a review process of the draft by other DPAs. Majority backing for Facebook’s lead EU data supervisor’s proposed settlement is required under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) before a decision can be finalized.The DPC’s draft WhatsApp decision, which it told us was sent to the other supervisors for review on December 24, is only the second such draft the Irish watchdog has issued to date in cross-border GDPR cases.The first case to go through the process was an investigation into a Twitter security breach — which led to the company being issued with a $550,000 fine last month.The WhatsApp case may look very timely, given the recent backlash over an update to its T&Cs, but it actually dates back to 2018, the year GDPR begun being applied — and relates to WhatsApp Ireland’s compliance with Articles 12-14 of the GDPR (which set out how information must be provided to data subjects whose information is being processed in order that they are able to exercise their rights).In a statement, the DPC said:As you are aware, the DPC has been conducting an investigation into WhatsApp Ireland’s compliance with Articles 12-14 of the GDPR in terms of transparency, including in relation to transparency around what information is shared with Facebook, since 2018. The DPC has provisionally concluded this investigation and we sent a draft decision to our fellow EU Data Protection Authorities on December 24, 2020 (in accordance with Article 60 of the GDPR in order to commence the co-decision-making process) and we are waiting to receive their comments on this draft decision.“When the process is completed and a final decision issues, it will make clear the standard of transparency to which WhatsApp is expected to adhere as articulated by EU Data Protection Authorities,” it added.A WhatsApp spokesperson added: “We continue to cooperate with the IDPC and await its final decision.”Ireland has additional ongoing GDPR investigations into other aspects of the tech giant’s business, including related to complaints filed back in\xa0May 2018 by the EU privacy rights not-for-profit, noyb (over so-called “forced consent”). In May 2020 the DPC said that separate investigation was at the decision-making phase — but so far it has not confirmed sending a draft decision for review.It’s also notably that the time between the DPC’s Twitter draft and the final decision being issued — after gaining majority backing from other EU DPAs — was almost seven months.The Twitter case was relatively straightforward (a data breach) versus the more complex business of assessing “transparency.” So a final decision on WhatsApp seems unlikely to come to a swifter resolution. There are clearly substantial differences of opinion between DPAs on how the GDPR should be enforced across the bloc. (In the Twitter case, for example, German DPAs suggested a fine of up to $22 million versus Ireland’s initial proposal of a maximum of $300,000). Although there is some hope that GDPR enforcement of cross-border cases will speed up as DPAs gain experience of the various mechanisms and processes involved in making these co-decisions (even if major ideological gaps remain).Returning to WhatsApp, the messaging platform has had plenty of problems with transparency in recent weeks — garnering lots of unwelcome attention and concern over the privacy implications of a confusing mandatory update to its T&Cs which has contributed to a major migration of users to alternative chat platforms, such as Signal and Telegram.The backlash led WhatsApp to announced last week that it was delaying enforcement of the new terms by three months.\xa0Last week Italy’s data protection agency also issued a warning over a lack of clarity in the T&Cs — saying it could intervene using an emergency process allowed for by EU law (which would be in addition to the ongoing DPC procedure).Confusion over WhatsApp’s new T&Cs triggers privacy warning from Italy\xa0On the WhatsApp T&Cs controversy, the DPC’s deputy commissioner Graham Doyle told us the regulator had received “numerous queries” from confused and concerned stakeholders that he said led it to reengage with the company. The regulator previously obtained a commitment from WhatsApp that there is “no change to data-sharing practices either in the European Region or the rest of the world.” But it subsequently confirmed it would delay enforcement of the new terms.“The updates made by WhatsApp last week are about providing clearer, more detailed information to users on how and why they use data. WhatsApp have confirmed to us that there is no change to data-sharing practices either in the European Region or the rest of the world arising from these updates. However, the DPC has received numerous queries from stakeholders who are confused and concerned about these updates,” Doyle said.“We engaged with WhatsApp on the matter and they confirmed to us that they will delay the date by which people will be asked to review and accept the terms from February 8 to May 15. In the meantime, WhatsApp will launch information campaigns to provide further clarity about how privacy and security works on the platform. We will continue to engage with WhatsApp on these updates.”While there’s no doubt Europe’s record of enforcement of its much vaunted data protection laws against tech giants remains a major weak point of the regulation, there are signs that increased user awareness of rights and, more broadly, concern for privacy, is causing a shift in the balance of power in favor of users.Proper privacy enforcement is still sorely lacking but Facebook being forced to put a T&C update on ice for three months — as its business is subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny — suggests the days of platform giants being able to move fast and break things are firmly on the wain.Similarly, for example, Facebook recently had to delay the launch of a dating feature in Europe while it consulted with the DPC. It also remains limited in the data it can share between WhatsApp and Facebook because of the existence of the GDPR — so still can’t\xa0share data for ad targeting and product enhancement purposes, even under the new terms.Europe, meanwhile, is coming with ex ante rules for platform giants that will place further obligations on how they can operate — with the aim of counteracting abusive/unfair business behaviors and bolstering competition in digital markets.GDPR enforcement must level up to catch big tech, report warnsUnderstanding Europe’s big push to rewrite the digital rulebookThis report was updated with comment from WhatsApp.']",Goama,"['WhatsApp', 'EU', 'NavigationClose', 'EU', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Justin Sullivan', 'the European Union', 'WhatsApp', 'Ireland’s Data Protection Commission', 'EU', 'EU', 'General Data Protection Regulation', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp Ireland’s', 'Articles 12-14', 'DPC', 'DPC', 'Articles 12-14', 'DPC', 'EU Data Protection Authorities', 'WhatsApp', 'EU Data Protection Authorities', 'WhatsApp', 'EU', 'DPC', 'EU', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'WhatsApp', 'EU', 'WhatsApp’s', 'WhatsApp', 'Graham Doyle', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'DPC', 'Doyle', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'T&C', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp.closePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'EU', 'decisionNatasha Lomas1:33 PM', 'the European Union', 'WhatsApp', 'Ireland’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

WhatsApp has amassed over 450 million users in India, its biggest market by users.Mittal described opportunities in building virtual worlds as a “much better approach for today’s world that is unconstrained by cheap, fast data and powerful smartphones.”The end of Hike’s messenger service comes at a time when Signal and Telegram have added tens of millions of users in recent weeks. A planned update to WhatsApp’s data-sharing policy has prompted many of its loyal fans to explore alternatives this month. “Both [Telegram and Signal] are very good. As entities they have the right incentives (more aligned with consumers) unlike Facebook products,” tweeted Mittal earlier this month.In recent years, Hike made bets on stickers and emojis to cater to the younger population in India. In a meeting with TechCrunch in late 2019, Mittal said that the startup was overwhelmed with the engagement stickers on its platform and was working to automate development of personalized stickers.In a different meeting last year, Mittal showcased emojis that replicated human expressions and a virtual hangout place called HikeLand. Vibe is the rebranded version of HikeLand and the emojis Hike developed will continue to be available to users on both the newer apps, Mittal said earlier this month.Hike, which has raised more than $260 million to date, had enough runway last year, Mittal said, who hinted that the startup may raise more capital a year later.Hike also attempted to build its own operating system through acquisition of a startup called Creo. In 2018, Hike launched Total OS that aimed to cater to users with low-cost Android smartphones and slow internet data.The startup later shut down the project. Mittal told TechCrunch that the arrival of Reliance Jio, which prompted Airtel and Vodafone to lower mobile data tariff on their networks, solved the data issues in the country and Total OS was no longer needed in the market.India’s WhatsApp rival Hike raises $175M led by Tencent at a $1.4B valuation']",its launch,"['Hike', 'WhatsApp', 'NavigationClose', 'Hike', 'WhatsApp', 'Anindito Mukherjee', 'Bloomberg / Getty ImagesIndia’s', 'WhatsApp', 'Hike Messenger', 'Tiger Global', 'SoftBank', 'Kavin Bharti Mittal', 'Rush', 'Mittal', 'Airtel’s', 'Sunil Bharti Mittal', 'Kavin', 'WhatsApp', 'Hike’s', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'WhatsApp’s', 'Signal', 'Hike', 'Mittal', 'Mittal', 'Hike', 'Mittal', 'Mittal', 'Hike', 'Android', 'Mittal', 'Reliance Jio', 'Airtel', 'Vodafone', 'WhatsApp', 'Hike', 'Tencent', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Hike', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Hike Messenger', 'Tiger Global', 'SoftBank', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/d2FEk66a6W,2021-01-18T07:00:11,Personio raises $125M on a $1.7B valuation for an HR platform targeting SMEs,"['With the last year changing how (and where) many of us work, organizations have started to rethink how well they manage their employees, and what tools they use to do that. Today, one of the startups that is building technology to address this challenge is announcing a major round of funding that underscores its traction to date.Personio — the German startup that targets small- and medium-sized businesses (10-2,000 employees) with an all-in-one HR platform covering recruiting and onboarding, payroll, absence tracking and other major HR functions — has picked up $125 million in funding at a $1.7 billion post-money valuation.The Series D is being co-led by Index Ventures and Meritech, with previous backers Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Northzone, Global Founders Capital and Picus all participating.The $1.7 billion valuation is a big jump on the company’s $500 million valuation a year ago, and it comes after a year where the startup has doubled its revenues and was not on the hunt to raise, with much of its previous fundraising still in the bank.Personio currently counts some 3,000 SMEs in Europe as customers.In an interview, Hanno Renner, the co-founder and CEO of Personio, said that the startup would be using the funding to continue building out the product — which operates a little like Workday, but built for much smaller organizations — as well as expanding its presence in Europe.Although SMEs can be a notoriously challenging customer segment, Renner said that a new opportunity has emerged: A new wave of people in the SME sector have started to realise the value of having a modern and integrated HR platform.“We started Personio in 2016 wanting to become the leading HR platform for midmarket companies, and we knew it could be a great company, but we realize it can be hard to grasp what HR really means,” he said. “But I think what has driven our business in the past year has been the realization that HR is not just an important part, but maybe the most important part, of any business.”It may take one magic turn to convert users, he said, by providing (as one example) tools to recruit, sign contracts and onboard new employees remotely. Still, he acknowledges that the midmarket — especially those companies not built around technology — has been “lagging for years,” with many still working off Excel spreadsheets, or even more surprisingly, pen and paper. “Supporting them by helping them to digitize in a more efficient way has been driving our business.”Personio is not the only startup hopeful that the shift in how we work will bring a new appreciation (and appetite) for purchasing HR tools. Others like Hibob have also seen a big boost in their business and have also been raising money to tap into the opportunity more aggressively.Hibob is looking to build in more training tools, underscoring the feature race that Personio will also have to run to keep up.But given the sheer numbers of SMBs in the European market — more than 25 million, and accounting for more than 99% of all enterprises, according to research from the European Union — the fact that many of them have yet to adopt any kind of HR platform at all, there remains a lot of growth for a number of players.“SMEs are the backbone of the European economy, employing 100 million people across the continent, but it is also a sector that has been neglected by software companies focused predominantly on large enterprises,” Martin Mignot, a partner at Index who sits on Personio’s board, said in a statement. “Personio changes that, having created a set of powerful tools tailored to address the needs of small businesses.”“We have had the pleasure of working with some of the most successful SaaS companies in the world, and given Personio’s success over the past five years and the immense market potential, we strongly believe in Personio’s ability to build an equally successful and impactful business,” added Alex Clayton, general partner at Meritech Capital, in his own statement. “After many great discussions with Hanno over recent years, we are now excited to be joining the journey.” Clayton is also joining the board with this round.Personio, the German HR platform for SMEs, raises $75M Series C at a $500M valuation']",Bloom & Wild,"['NavigationClose ScreenPersonio', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Getty ImagesWith', 'Index Ventures', 'Meritech', 'Accel', 'Venture Partners', 'Northzone', 'Global Founders Capital', 'Hanno Renner', 'Personio', 'Renner', 'SME', 'Personio', 'Hibob', 'Hibob', 'Personio', 'SMBs', 'the European Union', 'Martin Mignot', 'Personio’s', 'Alex Clayton', 'Meritech Capital', 'Clayton', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Lunden8:00 AM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/mIv8H18AGl,2021-01-18T06:41:44,Startups at CES showed how tech can help elderly people and their caregivers,"['The COVID-19 pandemic shined a harsh spotlight on the challenges many elderly people face. Older adults are among the highest-risk groups for developing cases that need hospitalization and nursing homes were especially vulnerable to outbreaks. While dealing with COVID-19, the elderly have also faced many other problems, including the difficulty of accessing medical care for chronic conditions during lockdowns and isolation.Many of these issues won’t go away after the pandemic. According to the United Nations, the global population of people 65 and over is growing faster than any other age group. At the same time, there is a critical shortage of caregivers, especially for elderly people who want to continue living at home instead of moving into nursing homes.Tech can help in many ways: By helping caregivers (and reducing burnout), allowing seniors to perform health monitoring at home and creating tools to combat isolation. During CES, there were several “age-tech” presentations. One of the most notable was AARP Innovation Lab, the nonprofit’s startup accelerator program. It presented nine companies at the virtual show.Zibrio’s smart scale for assessing postural stability or balance. Image Credits: ZibrioOne common theme among AARP’s group was tech that helps elderly people “age in place,” or stay in their homes or communities instead of moving into a nursing home. For example, Wheel Pad designs accessible home and work spaces that can be installed into existing structures and sites. Mighty Health is an app that pairs users with health coaches, certified trainers and personalized nutrition plans, while Zibrio, a scale that assesses users’ balance to predict if they are at risk for a fall, can also be incorporated into at-home routines.Other startups from AARP Innovation Lab focus on helping caregivers, too. For example, FallCall Solutions’ creates Apple Watch apps that send alerts if a fall is detected and help family members check on users. Another app, called Ianacare, helps family members coordinate caregiving tasks and ask for support. End-of-life planning is one of the most emotionally difficult processes for families, and Cake, an “end-of-life platform” helps by providing tools for estate and health care planning, as well as resources to help relatives cope with caregiving issues and grief.Other startups center on medical care. For people with chronic conditions, Folia Health helps monitor the progress of treatments. On the clinical side, Embleema’s software allows clinical investigators to share data and design studies, making pharmaceutical research more efficient.Nobi’s smart lamp alerts caregivers when a fall is detectedOther noteworthy age-tech startups at CES included Nobi, a smart lamp that automatically turns on when users stand up and sends alerts to family members if they fall. Nobi can also be used in residences and nursing homes.Caregiver Smart Solution’s app for caregivers to coordinate tasks. image Credits: IanacareCaregiver Smart Solutions is a multifaceted platform that makes it easier for seniors to stay at home with a machine-learning-based app for early detection of potential health issues, fall sensors, monitors and emergency buttons. For people with incontinence, DFree, a wearable device, can reduce stress by monitoring how full their bladder is with an ultrasound sensor and keeping track of their average time between bathroom visits. It’s available for both consumers and healthcare facilities.A diagram of companion robot Cutii’s features. Image Credits: CutiiFor elderly people living in nursing homes, Rendever is a virtual reality platform that wants to help reduce isolation. It can be used with reminiscence therapy, which guides individuals with dementia through experiences that remind them of their pasts and to allow virtual travel to landmarks. Cutii, a companion robot, also seeks to reduce loneliness. While companion robots have been a mainstay of CES for years, Cutii sets itself apart with entertainment like music, games and live events.

https://t.co/TNRJBkcUYJ,2021-01-18T06:24:52,Signal and Telegram are also growing in China — for now,"['As fears over WhatsApp’s privacy policies send millions of users in the West to Signal and Telegram, the two encrypted apps are also seeing a slight user uptick in China, where WeChat has long dominated and the government has a tight grip on online communication.Following WhatsApp’s pop-up notification reminding users that it shares their data with its parent Facebook, people began fleeing to alternate encrypted platforms. Telegram added 25 million just between January 10-13, the company said on its official Telegram channel, while Signal surged to the top of the App Store and Google Play Store in dozens of countries, TechCrunch learned earlier.The migration was accelerated when, on January 7, Elon Musk urged his 40 million Twitter followers to install Signal in a tweet that likely stoked more interest in the end-to-end encryption messenger.The growth of Telegram and Signal in China isn’t nearly as remarkable as their soaring popularity in regions where WhatsApp has been the mainstream chat app, but the uplift is a reminder that WeChat alternatives still exist in China in various capacities.Signal amassed 9,000 new downloads from the China App Store between January 8 and 12, up 500% from the period between January 3 and 7, according to data from research firm Sensor Tower. Telegram added 17,000 downloads during January 8-12, up 6% from the January 3-7 duration. WhatsApp’s growth stalled, recording 10,000 downloads in both periods.Sensor Tower estimates that Telegram has seen about 2.7 million total installs on China’s App Store, compared to 458,000 downloads from Signal and 9.5 million times from WhatsApp.The fact that Telegram, Signal and WhatsApp are accessible in China might come as a surprise to some people. But China’s censorship decisions can be arbitrary and inconsistent. As censorship monitoring site Apple Censorship shows, all major Western messengers are still available on the China App Store.The situation for Android is trickier. Google services are largely blocked in China and Android users revert to Android app stores operated by local companies like Tencent and Baidu. Neither Telegram nor Signal is available on these third-party Android stores, but users with a tool that can bypass China’s Great Firewall, such as a virtual private network (VPN), can access Google Play and install the encrypted messengers.The next challenge is actually using these apps. The major chat apps all get slightly different treatment from Beijing’s censorship apparatus. Some, like Signal, work perfectly without the need for a VPN. The catch is to sign up for Signal, a user must activate their account with a phone number, and Chinese phone numbers are tied to people’s real identities. Users have reported that WhatsApp occasionally works in China without a VPN, though it loads very slowly. And Facebook doesn’t work at all without a VPN.“Some websites and apps can remain untouched until they reach a certain threshold of users at which point the authorities will try to block or disrupt the website or app,” said Charlie Smith, the pseudonymous head of Great Fire, an organization monitoring the Chinese internet that also runs Apple Censorship.“Perhaps before this mass migration from WhatsApp, Signal did not have that many users in China. That might have changed over the last week in which case the authorities could be pondering restrictions for Signal,” Smith added.To legally operate in China, companies must store their data within China and submit information to the authorities for security spot-checks, according to a cybersecurity law enacted in 2017. Apple, for instance, partners with a local cloud provider to store the data of its Chinese users.The requirement raises questions about the type of interaction that Signal, Telegram and other foreign apps have with the Chinese authorities. Signal said\xa0it never turned over data to the Hong Kong police and had no data to turn over when concerns grew over Beijing’s heightened controls over the former British colony.The biggest challenges for apps like Signal in China, according to Smith, will come from Apple, which is constantly under fire by investors and activists for submitting to the Chinese authorities.In recent years, the American giant has stepped up app crackdown in China, zeroing in on services that grant Chinese users access to unfiltered information, such as VPN providers, RSS feed readers and podcast apps. Apple has also purged tens of thousands of unlicensed games in recent quarters after a years-long delay.“Apple has a history of preemptively censoring apps that they believe the authorities would want censored,” Smith observed. “If Apple decides to remove Signal in China, either on its own initiative or in direct response to a request from the authorities, then Apple customers in China will be left with no secure messaging options.”Apple’s iCloud user data in China is now handled by a state-owned mobile operator']",ended with the LauncherOne rocket initiating an automatic safety shutdown,"['Telegram', 'Telegram', 'Yves Dean/Getty ImagesAs', 'WhatsApp’s', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'WeChat', 'WhatsApp’s', 'Telegram', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'Elon Musk', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'WhatsApp', 'WeChat', 'Signal', 'Sensor Tower', 'Telegram', 'WhatsApp', 'Sensor Tower', 'Telegram', 'App Store', 'Signal', 'WhatsApp', 'Signal', 'WhatsApp', 'Apple Censorship', 'the China App Store', 'Android', 'Android', 'Android', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'Android', 'Great Firewall', 'VPN', 'Signal', 'VPN', 'Signal', 'WhatsApp', 'VPN', 'Charlie Smith', 'Great Fire', 'Apple Censorship', 'WhatsApp', 'Signal', 'Signal', 'Apple', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'Beijing’s', 'Signal', 'Apple', 'RSS', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Signal', 'Apple', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Telegram', 'Liao7:24 AM', 'WhatsApp’s', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'WeChat', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'Microsoft’s Dapr', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/mwLGGGmZVY,2021-01-18T00:02:22,UK’s Bloom & Wild raises $102M to seed its flower delivery service across Europe,"['Bloom & Wild, a London-based startup that takes an updated and online approach to the very traditional business of ordering and delivering flowers, has seen business blossom in the last year. And today, it is announcing a big round of funding to help it double down on the opportunity ahead.The company has raised £75 million ($102 million), a Series D that it plans to use to continue expanding across Europe (in addition to the UK, it operates today in Ireland, France, Germany and Austria) as it also continues to build out the business through technology, hiring new talent, thinking up more ideas and new partnerships, such as a new deal with supermarket giant Sainsbury’s to spearhead a new brick-and-mortar push.“We’ve been extremely fortunate to have been able to continue trading when we know how tough the past nine months or so has been for many,” said Aron Gelbard, Bloom & Wild’s co-founder & CEO, in an emailed interview. “It’s been a real joy & privilege to help keep our customers connected with their loved ones when we’ve all been missing being able to see our friends & family. We’ve certainly seen strong sales during periods of national restrictions across our markets, but sales have held strong during periods of relatively limited restrictions as we’ve retained new customers and converted many of our new recipients too.”The funding is being led by General Catalyst, with Index Ventures, Novator, Latitude Ventures, D4 Ventures (established by Hanzade Dogan), and existing investors such as Burda Principal Investments also participating.Bloom & Wild is not disclosing its valuation, but rumors of the round that were floating last week (per Sky News) pegged sources that said the valuation was around $500 million.The startup’s funding round, in any case, comes on the heels of some very strong growth. Revenues for the company were up 160% in 2020, with some 4 million deliveries of flowers in that period — more than had ever been made in the lifetime of the company previously, it said. That helped push the company into the black, its first profitable year.Founded in 2014, Bloom & Wild had only raised around $35 million before this, according to PitchBook, which estimated its pre-money valuation at just $88 million following its last round in 2018. In that context, $500 million represents a massive jump.Now, you might be asking yourself, “How can people think about flowers at a time like this? We’re in the midst of a global pandemic, for crying out loud.”And indeed, that is so. But it seems that there is a special place for flower-based gifts, whether for other people or just for ourselves, that are appreciated especially when times are hard.And while we’ve also seen people move quickly past that extra toilet paper, face masks and other practical purchases to click buy on many not-totally-essential indulgences — from fancy food and drinks through to nicer furniture since they’re spending so much time at home — I’d argue flowers have a unique position in the indulgence/gifting pantheon.In the midst of a health pandemic that has severely curtailed how people can interact with each other in person, getting flowers from a person can take on a new and sometimes deeper meaning. The physical presence — the colors, the smells, the rustle of life — they convey can be a proxy for the human interaction that we’re missing.“We’re privileged to have played our part in keeping people connected in this difficult period, and I’m proud of our growing team for scaling our operations whilst maintaining the signature thought and care we put into every order,” said Gelbard in a statement. “With this new backing from General Catalyst and Index we start 2021 with renewed energy to pursue our vision of becoming the world’s leading and most loved flower company.”If you’ve ever ordered flowers for someone or for yourself, you know there is no shortage of options for doing so. In the UK alone there are some 7,500 florists according to the British Florist Association, and that’s not counting thousands more online-only retailers (like Bloom & Wild) or the many services that knit these together into wider delivery networks such as Interflora or FTD.FTD has been something of a consolidator here: in 2018 it acquired a US flower delivery startup called BloomThat (which likened itself to an Uber for flowers).While some people still prefer to shop for tangible things like flowers in person, a lot of that has moved into the virtual world over the years — especially for those ordering flowers to be delivered to someone — making it in some ways much easier to launch and grow online-only flower businesses.Bloom & Wild’s product approach is to sell flowers as bouquets, and to give people the option of making the smaller of those bouquets extremely easy to deliver, by designing a box that fits through the typical UK mail slot (either in your front door or elsewhere).The bouquets it sells, meanwhile, are Instagrammably eye-catching, created for the kind of person who might discover them on that social network (where it has around 250,000 followers), and targeted at our modern predicament. (For example, the bouquet pictured above is called “The Ezra“. Its description: “This cocktail of vibrant oranges and soft lilacs reminds us of holidays in the sun. And the people we’d spend them with. Missing your travel buddy? Send them this instant day-brightener.”)There are options for ordering flowers for offices — although these are probably not getting ordered as much these days — and to build subscriptions, as you might with any other D2C product you order online. And once Bloom & Wild gets to know you and what you like, that will inform how and which flowers on the service are presented to you. Over time it’s moved into more than flowers — it sold Christmas trees this season, and offers a few gifts alongside its bouquets — and it is gradually building out a brick-and-mortar presence, too.But most of all, it seems the company has seen a surge of interest not just because of the efficiency and targeting of its service, but because it has gotten the product right — specifically delivering flowers that people like.Gelbard points out that the company has “the most direct supply chain in the flower industry, sourcing directly from growers. This means our customers get excellent value and their flowers last longer, arriving in bud and regularly blooming for up to ten days or more.”He also notes that the company has built a “bespoke technology and data science platform” focused on a quick and easy ordering experience on app or web. Lastly, “in a traditionally commoditized industry reliant on paid search, we’ve taken an innovative approach to product and brand development,” he notes, pointing to the “letterbox flower” invention.“Bloom & Wild has infused the traditional flower giving experience with predictive analytics and technology to deliver a fresher, less-travelled bouquet to the people you care most about,” said Adam Valkin, MD, General Catalyst, in a statement. “What’s most impressive about Aron and his team has been their duality of focus since launch. They’re bringing industry-leading efficiency to the intricate supply chain challenges of flower delivery while simultaneously building a beloved experience that connects with consumers in a remarkably authentic way.”Martin Mignot, partner at Index Ventures added: “Bloom & Wild team have reinvented every aspect of flower delivery and gifting, challenging the status quo at every stage. Through relentless execution, Aron and his team have created a delightful experience for customers, becoming the fastest growing flower business in Europe. We’re thrilled to partner with them as they scale internationally.”']",firing of the Jewish employee,"['Bloom & Wild', 'NavigationClose', 'Bloom & Wild', 'EuropeIngrid Lunden@ingridlunden', 'CommentBloom & Wild', 'Sainsbury', 'Aron Gelbard', 'General Catalyst', 'Index Ventures', 'Novator, Latitude Ventures', 'D4 Ventures', 'Hanzade Dogan', 'Burda Principal Investments', 'Bloom & Wild', 'Sky News', 'Bloom & Wild', 'PitchBook', '’ve', 'Gelbard', 'General Catalyst', 'the British Florist Association', 'Bloom & Wild’s', 'Bloom & Wild', 'Adam Valkin', 'Catalyst', 'Aron', 'Mignot', 'Index Ventures', 'Aron', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkCopy Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagseCommerceEuropeTCBloom', 'EuropeIngrid', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

GitHub did not disclose the name of the person who resigned, but it’s widely known that Carrie Olesen was the chief human resources officer at GitHub.In a tweet last night, GitHub’s senior director of global HR services, Gia Colosi, made some comments about the company and human resources. That tweet has since been deleted but the screenshot is below.In a later tweet, she went on to say that, “Women are in HR to clean up men’s messes. I done and tired.”Meanwhile, GitHub says it has “reversed the decision to separate with the employee” and is talking to his representative.“To the employee we wish to say publicly: We sincerely apologize,” Brescia said in the blog post.After the fired employee made a comment in Slack saying, “Stay safe homies, Nazis are about,” a fellow employee took offense, saying that type of rhetoric wasn’t good for work, the former employee previously told me. Two days later, he was fired, with a human relations representative citing a “pattern of behavior that is not conducive to company policy” as the rationale for his termination, he told me.In an interview with TechCrunch earlier this week, the now-former employee said he was genuinely concerned about his co-workers in the area, in addition to his Jewish family members. During that interview, he said he would not be interested in getting his job back, but would be interested in other forms of reconciliation. How to contact TechCrunch\nGot a tip?

https://t.co/myqyfA1YBy,2021-01-17T17:53:48,Threat of inauguration violence casts a long shadow over social media,"['As the U.S. heads into one of the most perilous phases of American democracy since the Civil War, social media companies are scrambling to shore up their patchwork defenses for a moment they appear to have believed would never come.Most major platforms pulled the emergency brake last week, deplatforming the president of the United States and enforcing suddenly robust rules against conspiracies, violent threats and undercurrents of armed insurrection, all of which proliferated on those services for years. But within a week’s time, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Apple and Google had all made historic decisions in the name of national stability — and appearances. Snapchat, TikTok, Reddit and even Pinterest took their own actions to prevent a terror plot from being hatched on their platforms.Now, we’re in the waiting phase. More than a week after a deadly pro-Trump riot invaded the iconic seat of the U.S. legislature, the internet still feels like it’s holding its breath, a now heavily fortified inauguration ceremony looming ahead.Image Credits: SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty ImagesWhat’s still out thereOn the largest social network of all, images hyping follow-up events continued to circulate midweek. One digital Facebook flyer promoted an “armed march on Capitol Hill and all state Capitols,” pushing the dangerous and false conspiracy that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.Facebook says that it’s working to identify flyers calling for “Stop the Steal” adjacent events using digital fingerprinting, the same process it uses to remove terrorist content from ISIS and al-Qaida. The company noted that it has seen flyers calling for events on January 17 across the country, January 18 in Virginia and Inauguration Day in D.C.At least some of Facebook’s new efforts are working: One popular flyer TechCrunch observed on the platform was removed from some users’ feeds this week. A number of “Stop the Steal” groups we’d observed over the last month also unceremoniously blinked offline early this week following more forceful action from the company. Still, given the writing on the wall, many groups had plenty of time to tweak their names by a few words or point followers elsewhere to organize.With only days until the presidential transition, acronym-heavy screeds promoting QAnon, an increasingly mainstream collection of outrageous pro-Trump government conspiracy theories, also remain easy to find. On one page with 2,500 followers, a QAnon believer pushed the debunked claim that anti-fascists executed the attack on the Capitol, claiming “January 6 was a trap.”Image Credits: Win McNamee/Getty ImagesOn a different QAnon group, an ominous post from an admin issued Congress a warning: “We have found a way to end this travesty! YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED!” The elaborate conspiracy’s followers were well represented at the deadly riot at the Capitol, as the many giant “Q” signs and esoteric T-shirt slogans made clear.In a statement to TechCrunch about the state of extremism on the platform, Facebook says it is coordinating with terrorism experts as well as law enforcement “to prevent direct threats to public safety.” The company also noted that it works with partners to stay aware of violent content taking root on other platforms.Facebook’s efforts are late and uneven, but they’re also more than the company has done to date. Measures from big social networks coupled with the absence of far-right social networks like Parler and Gab have left Trump’s most ardent supporters once again swearing off Silicon Valley and fanning out for an alternative.Twitter’s decentralized futureSocial media migrationPrivate messaging apps Telegram and Signal are both seeing an influx of users this week, but they offer something quite different from a Facebook or Twitter-like experience. Some expert social network observers see the recent migration as seasonal rather than permanent.“The spike in usage of messaging platforms like Telegram and Signal will be temporary,” Yonder CEO Jonathon Morgan told TechCrunch. “Most users will either settle on platforms with a social experience, like Gab, MeWe or Parler, if it returns, or will migrate back to Twitter and Facebook.”That company uses AI to track how social groups connect online and what they talk about — violent conspiracies included. Morgan believes that propaganda-spreading “performative internet warriors” make a lot of noise online, but a performance doesn’t work without an audience. Others may quietly pose a more serious threat.“The different types of engagement we saw during the assault on the Capitol mirror how these groups have fragmented online,” Morgan said. “We saw a large mob who was there to cheer on the extremists but didn’t enter the Capitol, performative internet warriors taking selfies, and paramilitaries carrying flex cuffs (mislabeled as ‘zip ties’ in a lot of social conversation), presumably ready to take hostages.“Most users (the mob) will be back on Parler if it returns, and in the meantime, they are moving to other apps that mimic the social experience of Twitter and Facebook, like MeWe.”Still, Morgan says that research shows “deplatforming” extremists and conspiracy-spreaders is an effective strategy and efforts by “tech companies from Airbnb to AWS” will reduce the chances of violence in the coming days.Cleaning up platforms can help turn the masses away from dangerous views, he explained, but the same efforts might further galvanize people with an existing intense commitment to those beliefs. With the winds shifting, already heterogeneous groups will be scattered too, making their efforts desperate and less predictable.Twitter’s decentralized futureDeplatforming works, with risksJonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told TechCrunch that social media companies still need to do much more to prepare for inauguration week. “We saw platforms fall short in their response to the Capitol insurrection,” Greenblatt said.He cautioned that while many changes are necessary, we should be ready for online extremism to evolve into a more fractured ecosystem. Echo chambers may become smaller and louder, even as the threat of “large scale” coordinated action diminishes.“The fracturing has also likely pushed people to start communicating with each other via encrypted apps and other private means, strengthening the connections between those in the chat and providing a space where people feel safe openly expressing violent thoughts, organizing future events and potentially plotting future violence,” Greenblatt said.By their own standards, social media companies have taken extraordinary measures in the U.S. in the last two weeks. But social networks have a long history of facilitating violence abroad, even as attention turns to political violence in America.Greenblatt’s repeated calls for companies to hire more human moderators, a suggestion often made by experts focused on extremism. He believes social media could still take other precautions for inauguration week, like introducing a delay into livestreams or disabling them altogether, bolstering rapid response teams and suspending more accounts temporarily rather than focusing on content takedowns and handing out “strikes.”“Platforms have provided little to nothing in the way of transparency about learnings from last week’s violent attack in the Capitol,” Greenblatt said.“We know the bare minimum of what they ought to be doing and what they are capable of doing. If these platforms actually provided transparency and insights, we could offer additional — and potentially significantly stronger — suggestions.”Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence']",the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch,"['Amazon', 'Twitter', 'Apple', 'Google', 'TikTok', 'pro-Trump', 'Capitol Hill', 'Capitols', 'ISIS', 'al-Qaida', 'QAnon', 'QAnon', 'QAnon', 'Congress', 'Facebook', 'Parler', 'Gab', 'Trump’s', 'Twitter’s', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'Jonathon Morgan', 'Gab', 'Parler', 'AI', 'Morgan', 'Capitol', 'Morgan', 'Parler', 'Morgan', 'Twitter’s', 'Greenblatt', 'the Anti-Defamation League', 'Greenblatt', 'Greenblatt', 'Greenblatt’s', 'Greenblatt', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Taylor Hatmaker6:53', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/0721TZv7F8,2021-01-17T15:35:25,Original Content podcast: Martin Scorsese and Fran Lebowitz have a good time in ‘Pretend It’s A City’,"['The concept behind the new Netflix documentary series “Pretend It’s A City” is pretty straightforward: Author Fran Lebowitz talks, while Martin Scorsese (who’s both director and an on-camera presence) listens and laughs.Lebowitz’s musings across seven episodes are organized by loose themes, such as “Metropolitan Transit” and “Library Services,” with the more recent footage interspersed with clips from older interviews. That’s pretty much it as far as structure goes; while Lebowitz shares a number of amusing anecdotes, there’s no attempt to explore the broader arc of her career or explain why we’re watching a show about her.And yet, as we discuss on the latest episode of the Original Content podcast, we both enjoyed watching the entire show.Darrell describes Lebowitz as the consummate party guest, full of aphorisms and provocative opinions on everything from technology to sports to the New York York City subway. And there’s something delightful about watching an accomplished director like Scorsese just relaxing and having a good time.The downside: It could be a little exasperating when we didn’t find Lebowitz’s remarks quite as hilarious as Scorsese did, and watching one episode after another meant that she eventually wore out her welcome. So it’s probably best to enjoy the series an episode at a time, rather than binging the whole thing at once.In addition to reviewing “Pretend It’s A City,” we also discussed Nielsen’s rankings of the most popular streaming services of 2020.You can listen to our review in the player below, subscribe using Apple Podcasts\xa0or find us in your podcast player of choice.

https://t.co/5FDQAXtBfp,2021-01-16T22:30:31,"After a record year for Israeli startups, 16 investors tell us what’s next","['Israel’s startup ecosystem raised record amounts of funding and produced 19 IPOs in 2020, despite the pandemic. Now tech companies across industries are poised for an even better year, according to more than a dozen investors we talked to in the country.Mainstay sectors like cybersecurity continue to matter, they said, but are maturing (more about that here). Some people are more excited by emerging areas like artificial intelligence, which has been a focus of the country’s military for years, and like cybersecurity is now producing many fresh teams of founders. Other investors felt that a broader range of industries, like fintech and biotech, would eventually produce the biggest companies in the country.Overall, local investors cited the country’s focus on global markets from day one, general support from the Israeli government and deep relationships with Silicon Valley and other global tech centers as additional factors that are powering it forward today.Here are the investors in their own words, for any TechCrunch reader who is interested in hiring, investing or founding a company in the country.

Our portfolio includes some great examples such as Fiverr that has disrupted the labor market by unlocking the global talent pool, or Talkspace, which is providing access to therapy to all.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nOur latest investment is At-bay, the insurance company for the digital age. At-bay offers an end-to-end solution with comprehensive risk assessment, a tailored cyber insurance policy, and active, risk-management service.Traditional insurers don’t have the know-how to properly and continually assess risk and approach digital risk the same way they approach physical products, through a statistical model that tries to predict the future based on past events. This a great example of company that is disrupting a traditional market.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nAs a growth fund, we are sector agnostic and diversify our investments across multiple industries. Would be happy to add proptech and agritech startups to our portfolio.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nWe stay clear of nonregulated industries and do not invest in cryptocurrency-related companies, gambling, etc.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nWe are focused on Israeli and Israeli-related companies. As growth companies they may have moved to NY or CA with their headquarters and maintained their R&D in Israel.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nA great amount of talent is cultivated in the military, which has spawned innovative cyber, AI and machine-learning companies. Also, significant experience and know-how have been accumulated here in big data analytics. SaaS models and cloud technologies have eliminated some of the barriers for Israeli companies and enable companies to quickly set up and set up a proof of concept.A few highlights in our portfolio include AppsFlyer, JoyTunes, Riskified, Talkspace and Guardicore.Data-driven AppsFlyer, spearheaded by Oren Kaniel, is an exciting mobile-attribution company that is rapidly growing ($200 million+ ARR in 2020) yet maintains a unique DNA. JoyTunes, led by Yuval Kaminka has developed a music-learning platform that has skyrocketed in 2020. The platform has been widely adopted doing so much good for so many people in a short amount of time. Guardicore is disrupting the traditional firewall market by providing fine-grained segmentation for greater attack resistance. Led by CEO Pavel Gurevich the company is seeing excellent traction. Riskified makes e-ommerce easier and safer and enables a thriving e-commerce environment. Founder duo Eido Gal and Assaf Feldman are a powerhouse of vision and execution capabilities. Talkspace has not only created the leading online therapy business, but is actually improving the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Americans, which are gaining access to therapy for the first time. Founding husband and wife Oren and Roni Frank are the ultimate power couple — creating an incredible business while creating some real impact.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nTech investors must make sure that Israel is part of their portfolio. Same as VC funds are deeply acquainted with Silicon Valley, tech investors cannot ignore this hub of innovation that has produced global market leading companies and serial entrepreneursWhat are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nProducts and services that require anything requiring on-site visits and integration as well as a long sales cycle involving face-to-face meetings and customer education are negatively impacted during this time. The upside is that companies that will develop a remote and simplified approach can reap gains from this time. Such an example is Augury from our portfolio that has developed an end-to-end solution to provide manufacturers with early, actionable and comprehensive insights into machine health and performance. This has proved to be of crucial value in the supply chain during the pandemic.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?\nEarlier in the month we have closed our third fund, Qumra III, at $260 million. This was done in a short time in a period when traveling and face-to-face meetings were impossible. Commitments to this fund, which is larger than its predecessor, included increased investments form existing LPs as well as new LPs from new geographies. This is a vote of confidence in the Israeli growth market in general and in Qumra in particular and has been a great achievement and source of hope going forward.Rafi Carmeli, Viola GrowthWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nPlatforms that are transforming how people and businesses operate, go about their business or leverage their core assets, using superior products, data and AI.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nZoomin Software.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nTransformation of the CFO and treasury suite of tools.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nA+ team, superior product demonstrated with business/market traction and a sizable market opportunity.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?Any area that needs to compete both with incumbents and also a set of already successful “new age” companies that made the first step of meaningful disruption.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nMore than 50%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?Plenty of interesting opportunities but like many places, competitive around the best of the best.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nDefinitely see changes in evolution of young startups given the behavioral changes caused by COVID.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nAny area that is exposed to mass physical engagement (pockets in travel, food, sports, etc.) are at risk. Remote engagement and productivity have potential to disrupt more industries, such as corporate events/virtual events.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nFounders are generally resilient and based on their view on the company’s position post-COVID (winner/at risk) and the capital resources available, should decide on appropriate level of caution/aggressiveness.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes in many areas. In general software has proven to be a winner and specifically SaaS as a business model has proven its resilience.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nThe speed and decisiveness at which humanity acted to adjust to the effects and aftermath of the pandemic, and importantly to proactively get us all out of the health and economic crisis as quickly as possible (e.g., the speed of creating vaccines).Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nIf something won’t matter in five years, don’t waste more than five minutes worrying about it now — easier said than done!Yonatan Mandelbaum, TLV PartnersWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nFintech (specifically embedded finance or financial SaaS), synthetic bio. This is in addition to traditional focus areas that we remain bullish on — cloud infrastructure, ML infra and cyber.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nUnit.co, meshpayments.com.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nThere simply isn’t enough innovation in fintech from the Israeli ecosystem. Our locale has managed to produce three of the most prolific insurtech companies (Next, Lemonade and Hippo), has a strong history of successful fintech companies (Payoneer, Forter, Riskified) and even has a few very promising earlier-stage ventures (Unit, Melio). That said, only about 10% of our overall deal flow are fintech companies. Areas such as vertical banking, embedded finance, compliance as a service and consumer finance consistently get overlooked by young Israeli founders.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nThe cliche VC answer: strong team, big market. This remains constant during all times.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\n(1) Cybersecurity — with one caveat. Israel will always be at the forefront of cyber innovation, and thus there will always be an opportunity for fledgling cyber companies in Israel. That said, it is 100% oversaturated, and there are too many examples of strong technical founders creating “yet another” SaaS security startup. (2) Remote work collaboration — clearly an issue that needs solving, but we have unsurprisingly seen an absurd amount of companies in the space. They are largely reactionary companies, and the companies that will prove to be the winners in this market have already been in the market for quite some time (Zoom, Alack, Miro, etc.).How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nMore than 50%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nFintech and bio are very well-positioned to thrive in Israel. In 10 years I wouldn’t be surprised if Israel is more well-known for those two sectors than it is for its cyber companies. Some companies to keep an eye on: Next Insurance, Unit, Mesh Payments, Aidoc, Deepcure, Immunai.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nI’m not saying anything new, but Israel is known as the startup nation for a reason. There is an incredible, thriving entrepreneurship culture that breeds fascinating companies weekly. Interestingly, valuation trends seem to trail the U.S. by about 12-18 months. So for later-stage VCs around the globe, Israel can represent an interesting opportunity to do deals of the same quality that they are doing in their locale, but for a more reasonable price.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nNot particularly. Israel a small country, and even if there may be a residential exodus from Tel Aviv, there won’t be a commercial one.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nTravel and proptech are more exposed due to COVID-19.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nCOVID hasn’t impacted our investment strategy much. We have remained steady in our search for interesting early-stage software opportunities and our commitment to invest substantial amounts even at the seed round. The biggest worries of the portfolio founders surround slower enterprise sales cycles due to WFH and smaller budgets from potential customers. Our early advice to founders was to ensure runway for 18 months in order to weather the storm. Recently however, after witnessing the incredibly founder-friendly fundraising landscape, our advice has been to put the pedal to the metal, reach certain benchmarks and raise capital.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nNo, there still hasn’t been enough time. That said, I will say that the initial enthusiasm of WFH has faded. The vast majority of our companies are clamoring to be back in the office.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nMy grandparents both recently passed away from COVID-19. Despite the tragic loss that it was for my family, there was one moment that truly gave me hope. I had the opportunity to visit my grandmother in the COVID ward at a local hospital before she passed (in full protective gear of course). Before entering the ward, while the nurses were going over the protocols with me and four other individuals who were there to visit their sick family members, I was surprised to realize that the five of us in the room were an eclectic bunch. Jewish, Muslim, religious and not, young and old. In that moment, we all gave each other strength, wished each other well and it gave me hope that we can truly become a unified country in the near future. The next exponential growth that occurs in the Israeli ecosystem will be when there is an influx of minorities (Arabs, ultra-Orthodox) into the workforce.Natalie Refuah, Viola GrowthWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nDevOps, martech, digital health.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nRapidAPI.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nExciting team, hypergrowth, disruptiveness.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nCyber, automotive.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nClose to 100%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nDevOps, cyber, enterprise software.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nVery positively.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nThere will be changes, that’s for sure.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?E-commerce tech-related companies will thrive.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nWe lowered our check size per company. My advice — if you are “with COVID trend” push hard, if you are “against COVID trend” — preserve cash.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nMore time with my kids, but in general I miss hugging people when i meet them, and I prefer meeting people face to face.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nLet the vaccine go!Daniel Cohen, Viola VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nGames, vertical AI and AI agencies, digital health.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nHyperguest, creating direct connectivity between hotels and OTAs. It’s the perfect next-gen travel infrastructure for the world post-pandemic.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nThe biggest trend in the post-COVID world will be the new work environment. We would love to see more startups that will create corporate solutions that are focused on the future of work. That can be at the workplace or at the home.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nUnique, innovative go-to-market. Leveraging technology to reach consumers in a more innovative way. It’s basically innovation in growth hacking, not only in great products.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nCybersecurity — the market is real and important, but there are too many startups with small niche solutions.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nMore than 50%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nThe most exciting trends locally are everything AI with focus on B2B apps. Same goes with digital health and consumer-focused health applications.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nIsrael is the #1 region globally in unicorn production, probably the hottest startup region right now.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nNo.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?The biggest change has been on company culture, which is hard to maintain in a distributed work-from-home environment. Companies need to be innovative and creative in maintaining/building culture, which was so much easier pre-COVID.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic? What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.The announcements around the vaccines make it clear that the end of the pandemic is near. I think 2021 will be amazing.Ben Wiener, Jumpspeed VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nJumpspeed invests exclusively in pre-seed and seed-stage startups from the Jerusalem startup ecosystem.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nMDGo.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t?

What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nJerusalem is well-positioned in certain clusters such as computer vision, general enterprise SaaS, AI/ML and healthtech.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nOur city’s startup ecosystem is underexploited and generates a few fantastic under-the-radar opportunities per year.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nYes.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nLittle direct impact on strategy because by definition I am investing in things that will go to market and ripen over years.Founders’ biggest worries are employee well-being, after that access to overseas customers and markets.Advice to founders: Stay calm and healthy, play the long game, take care of yourself, your family and your employees, don’t panic or cut staff reactively.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes but not that I can attribute directly to the pandemic.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nNo specific moment, just the general resilience and ability to adapt to the radically changing new realities that our portfolio founders have exhibited.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\n“Entrepreneurship in advanced technology, is not merely a matter of decision-making; it is a matter of imposing cognitive order on situations that are repeatedly ill-defined.” — W. Brian Arthur, “The Nature of Technology”No situation has been this ill-defined in the past century. Keep calm and carry on :-)Inbal Perlman, TAU VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nAt TAU, we are interested in a variety of sectors and evaluate each potential investment independently. In regards to trends, we look at trends with a grain of salt understanding that trends might come and go. When we see a particular trend, we try to understand if there is a need behind the trend and see beyond the initial hype. We want to assure that a startup is meeting a real need in the market. We are particularly interested in technologies that do not require too much time and capital to get to market.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nWe invested in a company called Xtend, which is creating human-machine telepresence allowing us to “step into” a machine, anywhere in the world, breaking the limits of physical reality. In particular, it develops solutions that allow people to interact with drones and other unmanned machine technologies. The company’s technology enables humans to extend themselves into the action by allowing them to virtually sit inside the drone for various tactical missions. What is exciting about Xtend is how the technology can be implemented in a variety of ways from defense and homeland security to reimagining entertainment, gaming and cinematography.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nWe like to see startups that are disrupting traditional industries by solving basic challenges and needs with innovative means. There are some industries that haven’t changed in many years. And if you create a technology that can be simply integrated into existing markets, it has the potential to gain significant traction and drastically change an industry. So we would love to see more startups going “back to the basics” asking questions about commonly felt pain points and innovating to solve those pains.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nWe want to get the feeling from the entrepreneur that they are professional, ready for the entrepreneurial journey, have the right mindset and skill set and will conquer the world. We understand that with early-stage startups, the product or service will likely change and therefore pay significant attention to the entrepreneurs themselves as an early indicator of future success.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nTechnology trends that often come and go can create an oversaturated market for startups. For example, previously there was hype around drones. Now, only the strongest companies in the drone industry have stuck around. Today, there are many startups responding to needs exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic such as remote learning and remote work. It is important to filter out whether these are solutions that will be around for a while and survive a post-COVID world or are temporary.We are more cautious about particular industries. In edtech, those who have successfully done exits, have done so at low amounts ($200 million-$300 million). For us, we are seeking larger exits. Blockchain is a difficult sector because it lacks a clear regulatory environment, subsequently raising many questions. Similarly, the cannabis industry also does not have a fixed regulatory environment across countries. Any small regulation change can highly impact the company. These are the sectors and areas that we are more cautious around.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nWe invest in startups that are exclusively Israeli startups but are targeted for a global market. At TAU Ventures, we have 1,000 sq. meter coworking office space where majority of our portfolio companies and accelerator program companies sit on a daily basis. On a daily basis we are engaging with our startups through kitchen chats and hallway encounters. Through our coworking space, we are directly investing in our local ecosystem both supporting entrepreneurs and identifying rising entrepreneurs.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nIn Israel, many Israeli entrepreneurs bring a high level of technical capabilities that they learn in the army such as in cyber and AI. After acquiring this knowledge and ability, they are well-prepared and able to transfer it to the commercial area. This is why we see many successful startups coming out of Israel particularly in these fields.\nFor example, founders of our portfolio company, SWIMM all come from leading elite tech training units in the army (Aram, Talpiot) and before founding SWIMM, established ITC (Israel Tech Challenge, a nonprofit high-tech academy that offers in-demand tech training programs in English in Tel Aviv, inspired by the IDF’s 8200 unit).\nFurthermore, Tel Aviv University (TAU), our affiliated university, is a leading research institute and academic leader in AI, engineering and other sciences and is producing entrepreneurs with high levels of knowledge. 50% of entrepreneurs in Israel have studied at TAU. And TAU ranked eighth worldwide as a top university producing VC-backed entrepreneurs, and the first outside of the US. So we are very excited by the added advantage we have in being affiliated closely with the university and the talent which it is producing.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nThe significant advantage of Israel is its small size. Because there is little to no local market, startups automatically think globally in their marketing and growth strategies. To best understand Israel and Israelis, it’s important to understand the influence of the military and the reality of thriving in a complex political environment in the Middle East. Military service is compulsory for all Israelis at the age of 18. The army plays an important role in the socialization, education, skills development, social network and fabric of Israeli society. Many personal and professional networks are the result of army service. As Israelis, we live in an environment where we need to constantly be innovative and one step ahead to survive. This innovative mindset has been instilled in our state of mind and cultural DNA.\nWe are proud that In Israel we have academics at the highest level in the world across a variety of fields. Multinationals from all over the world have local R&D centers or innovation hubs in Israel to source from the local talent pool. This presence of multinationals creates mutual exposure for both startups and corporates alike.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nAt TAU Ventures, the majority of our portfolio and accelerator companies sit next to us at our 1,000 sq. meter coworking space. At our offices, we love seeing our founders and their employees on a regular basis. This is how we have successfully created a strong familial culture at our VC. Throughout COVID, companies have continued to come in person to the office. This has reinforced to us that there is no exchange for face-to-face engagement. As early-stage investors, we understand that at this stage it is all about the people. At the end of the day, people want to be around people and you can not replace the experience of sharing a cup of coffee and shaking someone’s hand.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?\nCOVID affected companies in different ways. For some, it boosted business and for others it led them to shift their strategy and approach. Our companies who had clients in the travel industry or airports were obviously affected. In this situation, the company looked at their technology and reconsidered where and how their technology could be relevant to other consumers and industries. This particular company saw an opportunity to shift to logistics and supply chain clients. COVID is presenting opportunities for companies to reevaluate their target market and discover new applications of their technology for different purposes.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nAs a result of COVID, we have come to understand that things simply are taking more time, such as processes of raising funds or achieving the next milestone. We are patient and empathetic to the experiences of our startups.The startups’ most significant worry is that they will not succeed to raise enough funds before reaching their next milestone. And more so, if they are unable to prove their achievement milestones in time, then they might be forced to close business. As a result, our startups are raising more funds during this time to assure a longer runway. Our startups are also keenly aware of how periods of crisis might call on them to pivot and adapt to the current circumstances. Startups are making decisions around adjusting budgets, determining whether customers are still relevant, anticipating whether the circumstances are temporary or will renormalize and ultimately whether there is a completely new path to pivot to.\nIn light of the circumstances, we are advising our portfolio startups to raise more funds in next rounds to have runway for at least 1.5 years and not to be afraid of making drastic changes (i.e., pivots, changing budget, raising more funds).As a fund, we are assuring our entrepreneurs that if they choose to change paths, it is okay. Working from a coworking space alongside many of our founders enables us to stay updated on the startups, foster a strong internal ecosystem and network, and provide ongoing psychological safety for our entrepreneurs, which is ever so needed during these unprecedented times for startups.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nTwo of our portfolio companies have experienced impressive growth and are thriving in 2020.\n1. Gaviti is a SaaS company that specializes in receivable collections acceleration. Its system maps out the collection process to spot inefficiencies and optimize clients’ procedures. Specifically during COVID, many companies had increased economic pain points related to generating cash flow on a timely, efficient basis. Gaviti’s solution helps companies manage their collection payments. As a result of of the economic crisis this year, Gaviti saw fast growth in clients and have thrived during 2020.\n2. Medorion understands that health companies and hospitals want us to get regular health checkouts. Using AI and behavioral science, Medorion is driving people to take action for their own health by increasing engagement and communication between insurance companies and patients. During COVID, they are combating the coronavirus pandemic by applying their technology to create highly personalized engagement and communication plans targeted at those individuals who are at highest risk of COVID-19.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nIn recent months, it is inspiring to see our entrepreneurs continue fighting despite the uncertain economic and global circumstances. Many of our companies are continuing to recruit and hire. Our founders are resilient and are finding creative means to succeed. It is also a blessing to have a large coworking space hosting the offices of 10 startups and to see employees continue to come in to the office day in and day out working with their teams.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nTAU Ventures is a venture capital fund, affiliated with Tel Aviv University, for investing in early-stage, cutting-edge technologies based in Israel. TAU Ventures is the first and only university-affiliated VC in Israel.The fund has a unique, triangle model creating ecosystem connections between industry, academy and entrepreneurs. We connect to available resources at Tel Aviv University, foster strong partnerships in the high-tech industry and support entrepreneurs as they work side by side in the coworking office space of the VC located on the university campus.TAU Ventures also runs incubation programs in a variety of tech fields and offers a vibrant hub for entrepreneurs with concrete opportunities for design partnerships with international leading companies: AlphaC program (in partnership with NEC, Checkpoint, Innogy, Team8 and Cybereason) and The Xcelerator (an acceleration program with the Israeli Security Agency).\nIn 2018, IVC awarded TAU Ventures an award for one of the most active VCs in Israel. And in 2019, Geektime ranked TAU Ventures among the top five best VCs in Israel.David (Dede) Goldschmidt, Samsung Catalyst FundWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nDigital transformation and AI.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nSolarisbank (Germany).Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nAI-acceleration technologies seems to be overcrowded.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nLess than 50%.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nAI, cyber security. Excited about our portfolio company Innoviz (LiDAR). Excited about Avigdor Willenz, serial entrepreneur, including our portfolio company Habana Labs that was acquired for $2 billion.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nHighly dynamic and competitive, very global approach of entrepreneurs, risk takers, “can-do” approach.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nI don’t expect that to happen because a strong ecosystem of entrepreneurs, investors and service providers would be needed, and it takes years for that to grow.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?\nIndustries serving brick-and-mortars are likely to get weakened by accelerated transition to online.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nOur advice has been to be careful with cash. There is a disconnect between the strong momentum in the tech financing vis-a-vis overall economic crisis (unemployment, governments deficits, etc.). We have yet to see the full impact of COVID-19 on tech startups and better be prepared for that.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes, for pure digital plays.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nFrankly, I remain concerned because of the disconnect alluded to above. Vaccine momentum brings some hope, but too early to tell.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nI am very concerned from potential crunch in early stage. While overall financing numbers are growing almost across all geographies, investments are heavily weighted toward later stage and unicorns, and much fewer new companies are being formed. This will have dramatic impact on the tech ecosystem a few years out, if it does not change in 2021.Dror Nahumi, Norwest Venture PartnersWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nWe are a large fund that invests in early-to-late-stage companies across a wide range of sectors with a focus on consumer, enterprise and healthcare. My focus is primarily in Israeli companies and I’m seeing many exciting startups in security, SaaS, enterprise and cloud infrastructure, robotics and semiconductors.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nWe are naturally excited about all our latest investments. I recently invested in three seed-stage companies that are in stealth mode: an open-source cloud infrastructure company, a people analytics (HR) SaaS company and a next-generation business-intelligence platform.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nI believe there is a massive opportunity for startups to develop new solutions to fuel the digitization of next-generation enterprises. We’re seeing innovation and activity in this sector, but there’s so much more to be done, especially in light of challenges and vulnerabilities that COVID-19 has exposed. The hottest areas will be in human resources, production, security, infrastructure, sales and remote work.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nWe look for a great team, strong intellectual property and compelling execution. The new product idea can be a replacement (i.e., replace existing products that are aging, low performance) or a new category. Gong.io is a great example of a new category we invested in early on. We created the new “revenue intelligence” category that offers businesses automated, unfiltered and real-time insights on customer interactions and deals. This helps businesses understand what’s actually being said to transform the way they go to market.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nSecurity is currently oversaturated. There are too many companies doing similar things, which can make it difficult for newcomers to break through. Additionally, most emerging security startups are all claiming to use machine learning and AI to combat the next level of breaches. These are important areas to focus on, but it’s getting harder for these companies to differentiate themselves. That aside, we have made several great investments in security over the years and will continue to invest in great teams.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nOur team in Israel is 100% focused on our local market.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nNumerous industries in the Israeli market are poised to thrive and are doing so currently. Examples include startups in the security, SaaS, enterprise and the cloud infrastructure space, and even consumer services. We are especially excited to continue to witness the growth and success of Gong, VAST Data, WekaIO, Cynet, Wiliot, ActiveFence, Ermetic and SundaySky while building new companies who are still in the stealth stage.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nAt Norwest and especially among our Israel portfolio companies, we’ve been able to let our companies mature. We’ve given them the time and support they need to reach maturity. This is a very different approach than what we are seeing in other environments.Today, growth comes before M&A and companies get valuations much quicker. In past years, it was hard to raise money but it’s not so difficult now. In Israel, inside sales and marketing analytics allow companies to sell more effectively now than in the last decade. This gives entrepreneurs flexibility, room to expand into other markets and the ability to hire top talent globally versus just within their own region.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nIsrael is so small that you are never really too far outside a major city. We expect our startup hub to stay intact even if individuals and businesses choose to move slightly outside of the main CBD.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nThe travel industry has been massively impacted in every market globally since the COVID-19 outbreak. That said, that means there is a huge opportunity to fill gaps based on business and consumer needs as we approach a post-pandemic normal.I would say that solutions with huge potential are those centered on hybrid workforces as enterprises rethink the future of work. These have the potential to significantly benefit from the pandemic in the short and long term.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nCOVID-19 has not impacted our investment strategy. However, in recent conversations with our portfolio companies, it’s clear that brands can emerge stronger than ever with an adaptable strategy, adjusted expectations, strong marketing and B2C communications, and compassionate leadership.Over the past several months, we’ve advised companies in our portfolio to focus on building their business while prioritizing the safety of their workforce, which could mean further extending work-from-home policies or making remote work a standard option in their hiring practices. Companies’ ability to innovate and adapt while building their business around the new normal will be better positioned to succeed in a post-COVID landscape.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nWhile it’s not one particular moment, there were many times this past year where our portfolio companies faced major challenges due to the pandemic and were still able to continue to expand their businesses. Every sales quarter that shows growth and success gives me hope.Sharin Fisher, Fort Ross VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nI’m mostly excited about AI/ML technologies, cybersecurity companies and the global opportunity in B2B SaaS companies in general; companies that help to optimize business processes and boost efficiency (e.g., one of our portfolio companies, Kryon, is operating in the robotic process automation space, evaluating business processes, and recommending which ones to automate in order to free up underutilized human talent). We are seeing many successful Israeli SaaS companies across the board, from marketing and collaboration tools, business intelligence products, to payment systems.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nMy latest investment was in a B2B SaaS company that disrupts a huge market. I’m mostly excited about the team, which contains senior executives and second-time entrepreneurs with domain expertise.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?We are looking for companies that have a big market, a compelling story and a clear path to building a large business. When we invest, companies already have traction, a diverse customer base, established and repeatable sales process and metrics. So, when we dive deeper into the company’s metrics we would like to see they support the company’s assumptions and ability to scale up properly.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nWFH enablement tools (from security to communication tools).How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nWe are a global VC with a distributed team, focused on investing in midstage companies based in the U.S. and Israel, that can become global leaders. I’m leading our investments in the Israeli companies, globally.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nIsrael is well-positioned to build and grow large companies that can become segment leaders. We are seeing many leading companies across multiple sectors such as mobility (Moovit, Mobileye), cybersecurity (Armis, Cybereason, SentinelOne), fintech (Lemonade, Payoneer, eToro), information technology (Jfrog, Snyk), etc.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nThe Israeli ecosystem has matured significantly over the last decade, mainly due to repeat entrepreneurs who bring knowledge and relevant experience to the table. They aspire to build meaningful companies. On top of that, there’s more available late-stage capital, allowing companies to stay private longer and become mega-acquisitions/IPO.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nThe COVID-19 crisis has impacted Israeli founders in terms of how and from where they work. As many Israeli startups aim to tap into the U.S. market, they usually relocate pretty early on, mainly to build relationships with potential customers. Since the pandemic has created a situation where you have to sell your product/service remotely, physical location has become less relevant. In the short term, I believe we’ll see more Israeli founders working out of Israel, especially when taking into account the advantages (e.g., lower cost of living compared to other places like NYC/San Francisco). In the long run, there’s a high probability that founders who can keep the same sales efficiency remotely will continue to work out of their home country.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nAll of the segments we look at are thriving or haven’t changed significantly. I’m mostly interested in startups that are able to sell remotely and have an established inside sales team with a simple integration/deployment, because I believe they are in a better position to scale faster even in this climate.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nOur investment strategy remains the same; we are still looking to back companies that can become global leaders and aspire to disrupt huge markets. In terms of the work with our portfolio companies, our founders have already made the needed adjustments and are now more focused on capital efficiency and expanding the runway.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nMost of our portfolio adapted to the crisis quite fast and have enough runway to reach their next milestone. For some of our portfolio companies, especially those that support the digital transformation, the pandemic has created business opportunities and accelerated the adoption of their technology. As a result, we deployed additional capital to help them leverage this momentum.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nAlthough the pandemic has created uncertainty for all of us, we have still been seeing more (+14) Israeli companies reaching unicorn status/going public during the past months.Adi Levanon Chazan, Flint CapitalWhat’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nSensi.ai.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nA bit over 50% of the portfolio are Israeli startups, the remaining 50% divide between Europe and the U.S.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nFintech has been continuing to grow and will thrive over time. I’m excited about companies like Melio, Unit, Acrocharge and Rapyd.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nVery important to have local partners and try to expand the local network as much as possible, best would be to have a person on the ground dedicated to Israeli investments.Chaim Meir Tessler, partner, OurCrowdWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nFintech, cloud services, quantum software, cyber.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nClosed at time of writing this: D-ID.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nBuilt from the ground up remote educational platforms.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nFounders I like to work with and believe in.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nMicromobility, autonomous car sensors.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\n60%-70% local.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nCyber, computer vision, semiconductor, quantum computing all thrive.The banking infrastructure companies starting to emerge look fantastic.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nGreat market, easy to network, mostly friendly to coinvestment.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nWith the world becoming flat, innovation will definitely sprout up in new areas.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?\nCOVID hasn’t strongly affected our overall strategy other than a slowdown in March/April. The biggest worry is inadequate funding/runway.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nRealizing that we landed in this pandemic on a moment in history that we had the tools needed to enable a large amount of the world’s population to continue working without having to be in a specific physical location.Noam Kaiser, Intel CapitalWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nCloud adoption through digital transformation to hybrid cloud, 5G, vertical AI-based SaaS.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nCellwize — basically opening up RAN (4G and 5G) to any API, cloud environment compatibility.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nSolution allowing application to run across data sources in multiple buckets across hybrid/multicloud environments.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nDeep understanding of the area and the customer needs, a complementing trend, high revenue potential within five years.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nMLOps, too many, too quickly, Storage at large.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nMore.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nSafebreach — Red Team automation for cybersecurity teams, Verbit — vertical AI, transcription.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nIt hasn’t slowed down, plenty of opportunity, you have to move fast.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nI don’t see the pandemic having that effect. Hubs will remain as are.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?\nAnything relying on on-prem slowed down; this can be semiconductors and retail. but it’s recovering.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nNot really, we invest the same amount into the same amount of companies at same stages as before.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nYes, deals are closing, financing is taking place as well as M&As.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nSimply lively investment atmosphere, new up rounds and several M&A processes emerging.Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?\nCareful optimism, raise aggressively and cash up when possible, refresh the pipeline and get to it, corporates are back into closing deals.Tal Slobodkin, StageOne VenturesWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nCloud computing and\u200b software infrastructure\u200b/cybersecurity/DevOps/connected everything/deep compute, big data and AI/next-generation storage and data center.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nR-Go Robotics are pioneering an artificial perception technology that enables mobile robots to understand complex surroundings and operate autonomously just like humans.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t?

What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nWe see a lot of could monitoring services/SaaS cloud startups all competing with very similar technologies.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nIsrael 85%; USA 15% — always looking to expand in the U.S. market as well.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nStageOne portfolio companies: Coralogix, Silverfort, Epsagon, Avanan, Neuroblade. Other companies: OwnBackup/RunAI/Verbit/Indegy — all based in Israel.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nLess relevant for Israel and more for the U.S., but yes we will probably see new founders from different geographies, which is a good thing, giving new opportunities to people that before may have not considered starting a company.What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nWe do see that COVID-19 has less of an effect on the cybersecurity industry as many organizations are looking for new solutions, as the risk of cyberattacks increases due to remote working and refocusing a lot of their activity to the digital world.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nOur companies continue to adapt and make the necessary changes and plans for the near future. Most of the companies have continued the work-from-home policy.Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?\nSeeing our companies continue to grow and expand both in people and product. They all adapted to the situation for both the short term and long run. They have continued to raise funds and some companies have even developed additional products to assist with COVID-19-related issues.Ayal Itzkoviz, managing partner, Pitango FirstWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nDisruption in traditional markets yearning innovation, such as retail, insurtech, logistics, etc.B2B2B: Companies no longer wish to build things they can buy. Buying key components of the product/software enables companies to focus on the innovation side. One example is Frontegg — the company provides a set of pre-built, essential SaaS product capabilities that can easily and seamlessly integrate within any new or existing SaaS application. This enables dev teams to focus on perfecting the truly differentiating and valuable features at the heart of their SaaS offering. Another viable example is Stripe and its offering in the payments market.Cyber: 2020 taught us many lessons, one of them is that tech is just getting more exciting as digital transformation is enhanced, and the other is that the digital revolution presents cyber challenges that didn’t exist before. This results in continued opportunities for disruption in this domain.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nFrontegg — a startup that transforms the way SaaS is being built, so that developers don’t need to develop nondifferentiating code and features. Frontegg provides a state of the art SaaS-as-a-service platform, perfectly integrated within the company’s stack and allowing it to do what it’s best at: building their own product. Frontegg is the first pre-built suite of universal SaaS capabilities, enabling teams to focus on core features, shorten time-to-market and drive user adoption. Frontegg’s mission is to accelerate the delivery of enterprise-grade SaaS applications while providing the safest, most secure and optimal user experience.Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?\nFirst: more open-source projects. They do exist, but usually operate under the radar and come out of stealth mode when they’re already mature and beyond the phase of seed and stage on which Pitango First is focused.Quantum computing, in our view, has reached a point of no return. We’ll be happy to see entrepreneurs, scientists and business people in Israel jumping on the opportunity wagon already now, and build companies now, before the quantum market begins what will surely be an exponential growth.Lastly are startups with a double bottom line, i.e., startups that while solving a pain point in the market they’re in and have a potential to become category leader, also address an impact category. Pitango is the first VC to integrate ESG practices into its mainstream activities. As part of this strategy, and as a first step, we are focusing on our vast portfolio of companies and work closely with them to embedESG into their core practices through a “migration” process.Pitango aims to move the needle in the venture capital space through the “AND” philosophy: profit AND purpose, capital AND impact. Pitango is introducing a new paradigm of how venture capital does impact and integrates the “AND” philosophy by turning to a new opportunity set: the impact migrants. i.e., those startups that, although might not have been created under the SDG narrative, have the potential and a desire to embrace and track their impact. They will define their impact mission, integrate SDG targets within their business performance and track impact in alignment with financial targets, all without losing sight of their primary mission to deliver superior financial returns.Furthermore, Pitango applies this AND philosophy beyond its existing portfolio and onto future deal flow review. We call it the “mainstreaming” of impact investing.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nThe Israeli market has evolved tremendously in recent years. While the IPO market used to be out of reach for Israeli-born companies, this is no longer the case. We are looking for the visionaries, the dent blowers, the unconventional types who are eager to solve the biggest of challenges and are aiming at building an IPO-able business rather than an M&A one.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nPitango First is focused on Israeli/Israeli-related startups. From time to time we identify an investment opportunity in areas we have defined as strategic, in which the Israeli market isn’t mature enough and for which we believe we can add significant value and then invest in non-Israeli companies.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nIsrael is a super strong innovation hub. One of the major evolution trends of recent years is that the traditional glass ceiling that Israeli startups used to tackle has been shattered. Global players realize that now they can get the same upside like SV-based companies, in much more reasonable terms, and sometimes, less competition.\nSomewhat counterintuitively, we see the investment climate in these times of COVID-19 being extremely vibrant and competitive. Strong teams are raising significant rounds at record high valuations, which add up to the current belief that COVID-19 didn’t slow, but accelerated the digital transformation.What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?\nFor many seed early-stage startups that have secured funding, COVID-19 didn’t set setbacks in their plans, as they are further from the market from more mature companies. However, such companies, when backed by strong investors, while they may experience decrease in their revenues, are using this period to gain strength by acquiring companies within their ecosystem and position themselves better toward the out-of-pandemic curve that will eventually be here in a few short quarters.What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nThe pattern of investing for the long run during the pandemic. Looking far into the horizon, as veterans of previous crises we were able to share our experience and insights and help them better deal with the crisis. Also, this question can’t be answered without mentioning the COVID-19 vaccines, which set a magnificent example to the extent humanity can benefit when tech, medical companies and governments join hands and engage in a group effort.Ittai Harel, managing partner, Pitango HealthTechWhat trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?\nThe consumerization of healthcare.What’s your latest, most exciting investment?\nHomeThrive — a tech-enabled healthcare services company tackling the aging-in-home challenge and helping families help their loved ones age happily.What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?\nAn all-star team building a category-defining or category-leading company with demonstrable clinical AND financial outcomes.Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?\nNarrow wearables that do not integrate into a clinical or life workflow.How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?\nPitango HealthTech is focused on Israeli/Israeli-related startups. From time to time we identify an investment opportunity in areas we have defined as strategic, in which the Israeli market isn’t mature enough and for which we believe we can add significant value, and then invest in non-Israeli companies.Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?\nIsrael has many thriving healthcare sectors — from RPM and computer vision in digital health to cardiovascular in med devices to drug research in biotech and pharma. We are excited about our portfolio company Variantyx (a provider of whole genome sequencing and analytics unique platform solution) and Alike (a patient-facing platform to allow individuals to access and analyze their medical data and to connect to others similar to them). We are also excited to be part of this ecosystem and to lead thought leadership in it.How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?\nThe healthcare innovation ecosystem in Israel is thriving. There are incredible entrepreneurs and opportunities with global potential and reach that global investors should be aware of.Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?\nTo some extent we are witness more disbursement in Israel, but there is nonetheless a strong draw to co-locating in hubs and we expect to see Tel-Aviv and the central area in Israel to continue dominating in terms of attractiveness to strong teams.Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19?Hospitals have seen a drastic decline in elective procedures and an overall disruption to their operations and budgets. Startups that are able to introduce new technologies to make this shift efficient and painless stand to win from the current trend.How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?\nFor the healthcare industry, COVID-19 has brought challenges — but also opportunities. We believe overall that our companies (and the industry overall) stand to gain from the shift as stakeholders are quicker to adopt changes that before took much longer. We advise our — and all — portfolio companies to prepare for the days after COVID and think through what changes in their specific segment will be long-lasting and are “here to stay.”What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.\nWhen the first individual in the U.K. — a 90-year-old woman — received the vaccine. A turning point hopefully for the entire world.']",here,"['NavigationClose', 'Butcher@mikebutcher', 'Ilan Shacham', 'Getty ImagesIsrael’s', 'Mainstay', 'Extra Crunch', 'Boaz Dinte', 'Qumra CapitalRafi Carmeli', 'Viola GrowthYonatan Mandelbaum', 'TLV PartnersNatalie Refuah', 'Viola GrowthDaniel Cohen', 'Viola', 'VenturesBen', 'Jumpspeed VenturesInbal Perlman', 'TAU VenturesDavid', 'Dede', 'Samsung Catalyst', 'Nahumi', 'Norwest Venture PartnersSharin Fisher', 'VenturesAdi', 'Levanon Chazan', 'Flint CapitalChaim Meir Tessler', 'Kaiser', 'Intel CapitalTal Slobodkin', 'StageOne Ventures', 'FirstIttai Harel', 'Fiverr', 'Talkspace', 'AI', 'AppsFlyer', 'JoyTunes', 'Riskified', 'Talkspace', 'AppsFlyer', 'Oren Kaniel', 'ARR', 'JoyTunes', 'Yuval Kaminka', 'Pavel Gurevich', 'Eido Gal', 'Assaf Feldman', 'Talkspace', 'Oren', 'Roni Frank', 'VC', 'Augury', 'COVID-19', 'Qumra III', 'Rafi Carmeli', 'Viola', 'Zoomin Software', 'CFO', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'post-COVID', 'TechCrunch', 'done!Yonatan Mandelbaum', 'ML', 'Next', 'Riskified', 'Melio', 'VC', 'Next Insurance', 'Mesh Payments', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'WFH', 'WFH', 'Natalie Refuah', 'Viola', 'DevOps', 'DevOps', 'COVID-19', 'TechCrunch', 'Viola', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'COVID-19', 'Ben Wiener', 'Jumpspeed VenturesWhat', 'AI/ML', 'COVID-19', 'TechCrunch', 'W.

https://t.co/6B3VzKqwDd,2021-01-16T21:00:34,No one knows what anything is worth,"['Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on\xa0the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Click\xa0here\xa0if you want it in your inbox every Saturday morning.Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.It was yet another week of startups that became unicorns going public, only to see their valuation soar. Already marked up by their IPO pricing, seeing so many unicorns achieve such rich public-market valuations made us wonder who was mispricing whom.It’s a matter of taste, a semantic argument, a tempest in a teacup. What matters more is that precisely no one knows what anything is worth, and that’s making a lot of people rich and/or mad.Who is underpricing Roblox?This is not a new theme. I’ve touched on it for years, but what matters for us today is that there appear to be three distinct valuation bands for companies, and the gaps between them do not appear ready to shrink. You could even argue that they have widened.Band 1 is the private capital cohort. These are the folks who valued Affirm at $19.93 per share in its September 2020 round and Roblox at $4 billion in February of 2020. Now Affirm is worth $116.58 per share, and Roblox is worth $29.5 billion. Whoops?Band 2 is the long-term public investing cohort. These are folks critical in the IPO pricing context. They are willing to pay more for startups than the private capital crew. Affirm was not worth under $20 per share to this group, instead it was worth $49 per share just a few months later. Whoops?Band 3 is the retail cohort, the /r/WallStreetBets, meme-stock, fintech Twitter rabble that are both incredibly fun to watch and also the sort of person you wouldn’t loan $500 to while in Las Vegas. They are willing to pay nearly infinite money for certain stocks — like Tesla — and often far more than the more conservative public money. Demand from the retail squad can greatly amplify the value of a newly listed company by making the supply/demand curve utterly wonky. This is how you get Poshmark more than doubling a strong IPO valuation on its first day.Most investors do well in today’s world. Though Band 1 likes to blame Band 2 for not being willing to pay Band 3 prices, it always sounds like the private capital folks are merely complaining about sharing some of the winnings with another party.Regardless, who really knows what anything is worth? I was recently chatting with an early-stage founder who has a history of investing — narrowing it down to 17,823 people, I know — about the price of software companies both private and public and why they may or may not make sense. He said that old valuation models at banks presumed that software companies’ growth would go to zero over time, and that profits would be rare among SaaS concerns. Both concepts were wrong, so prices went up.But I have yet to have anyone explain to me why companies that would have been valued at 10x next year’s revenues can now get, at median, 18.1x. I have a working theory of what’s going on, but none of it points to sanity, or pricing that is grokkable through a lens that isn’t hype.\xa0A theory about the current IPO marketMilestones and megaroundsOn the milestone front, it was a huge week for leaving the private markets and joining the Big Kid Club. Namely for Affirm and Poshmark, which priced well and started to trade. And for Bumble, which filed to go public. They are targeting a good IPO window.But there was lots more going on, including a milestone that caught my eye. M1 Finance, a fintech startup that brings together lots of pieces of the fintech playbook into a single service, reached $3 billion in assets under management (AUM) this week. The company had reached $2 billion in AUM last September, after reaching $1 billion in February of 2020.Why do we care? The company previously told TechCrunch that it works to generate revenues worth around 1% of AUM. If that percentage has held past its October, 2020 Series C, the company just added around $10 million in ARR in under half a year. That’s a pace of revenue creation that made me sit up and take notice. (Shoutout to Josh for never shutting up about the Midwest.)But I really bring up the M1 Finance milestone for a different reason. Namely that I am consistently surprised at how deep certain markets are. Neobanks that are still growing; the OKR software market’s surprising depth; the ability of M1 to accrete deposits in a market with so many incumbents and well-funded startups.Perhaps this is why prices make no sense; if you can’t see the edge limits of TAM, can anything be overpriced?Moving on, some quick notes on things from the week that mattered:GitLab is now worth $6 billion and hit $150 million in annual recurring revenue last year. It grew 75%, we presume year-over-year in its most recent quarter.Fintech upstart LendingPoint raised $125 million at an undisclosed valuation.NYC-based Paige raised $100 million. It uses computers to help make diagnoses.One more VC Visa-Plaid takeAziz Gilani, a managing director at Mercury Fund and an advocate of Texas (observe his Twitter handle), wrote in late regarding our query for investor notes on the Visa-Plaid breakup. You can read the rest here.But who are we to deprive you of useful notes. And Gilani is a nice person. So, here are his $0.02:My big take-away on the Plaid/Visa deal falling apart is about how fast everything in 2021 is moving. Arguably the biggest advantage of SPACs over direct listings and IPOs is how fast those liquidity events can get done. In a world in which valuation[s] change week to week, the delays created by the DOJ can kill a deal — even if the DOJ would eventually lose in court.I’m philosophically super negative about the government imposing their will, but I’m also personally excited about the current wave of insurgent startups not getting gobbled up by the FAANGs of the world. For the last several years too many startups fell victim to the “quick exit” mentality personified by Mint selling so fast to Intuit. With fast/cheap capital freely available, today’s crop of startups are going big.Worth chewing on.Venture capitalists react to Visa-Plaid deal meltdownOdds/EndsWhat a week.

Meanwhile, Facebook created a new executive role pertaining to civil rights and California’s Proposition 22 faced its first legal challenge this year.All that and more in this week’s edition of Human Capital.Facebook hires VP of civil rightsFacebook hired Roy Austin to become its first-ever VP of Civil Rights and Deputy General Counsel to create a new civil rights organization within the company. Austin is set to start on January 19 and will be based in Washington, D.C.Austin most recently served as a civil rights lawyer at Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP. Prior to that, Austin co-authored a report on big data and civil rights and worked with President Barack Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.Prop 22 faces lawsuit challenging its constitutionalityA group of rideshare drivers in California and the Service Employees International Union filed a lawsuit alleging Proposition 22 violates California’s constitution. The goal of the suit is to overturn Prop 22, which classifies gig workers as independent contractors in California.The suit, filed in California’s Supreme Court, argues Prop 22 makes it harder for the state’s legislature to create and enforce a workers’ compensation system for gig workers. It also argues Prop 22 violates the rule that limits ballot measures to a single issue, as well as unconstitutionally defines what would count as an amendment to the measure. As it stands today, Prop 22 requires a seven-eighths legislative supermajority in order to amend the measure.Gig workers, SEIU file lawsuit alleging Prop 22 is unconstitutionalBest tech companies to work for, according to GlassdoorGlassdoor released its annual ranking of the best companies to work for in 2021. We broke out the top 10 tech companies from the list of large businesses (1,000+ employees) as well as from the small to medium-sized business list.Despite recent allegations of wrongful firings and demands of better workplace conditions, Google ranked number three on the list of best tech companies, while Facebook ranked fifth.\xa0Netflix releases first diversity reportThis was not the first time Netflix had shared this type of data, but the company had not put a bow on it until now.Worldwide, women make up 47.1% of Netflix’s workforce.

In an interview with TechCrunch, the now-former employee said he was genuinely concerned about his coworkers in the area, in addition to his Jewish family members.\xa0TechCrunch agreed to keep the identity of the terminated employee confidential due to fears for his and his family’s safety.After making a comment in Slack saying, “stay safe homies, Nazis are about,” a fellow employee took offense, saying that type of rhetoric wasn’t good for work, the former employee told me. Two days later, he was fired, with a human relations representative citing a “pattern of behavior that is not conducive to company policy” as the rationale for his termination, he told me.Now, the terminated employee says he is currently seeking counsel to ensure his family is protected, as well as figure out if he can receive damages or some other form of reconciliation. The fired employee said GitHub has reached out to him for help in the internal investigation, but is waiting to engage with the company until he has legal representation in place.You can read the full story here.Dropbox lays off 315 peopleDropbox laid off 11% of its global workforce, which comes to 315 people affected.

https://t.co/eHSupONQ94,2021-01-16T19:00:08,"Stay gold, ‘Plaid for X’ startups","['A failed acquisition usually triggers the same series of questions: What does this mean for early-stage startups in the sector? Will a chilling effect occur and hurt valuations? Will VCs stop funding this category? How will the exit environment look going forward?This week gave that narrative a bullish twist. Visa and Plaid announced that they have reached a mutual agreement to no longer pursue a merger. The $5.3 billion deal had been under antitrust scrutiny from the DOJ, and eventually ended amid these regulatory challenges.Fintech VCs and startups alike reacted to the fallen deal with aggressive optimism about Plaid’s future as an independently-owned fintech startup.The most common arguments?Plaid’s price in this current moment is far beyond $5.3 billion, so now that it is a free bird it will pursue a much larger exitPlaid will go public through SPAC because it is in charge of its own destiny.And my favorite: One day, Plaid will buy Visa.In an interview with TechCrunch, Plaid CEO Zach Perret wouldn’t give too many details on the future (and whether a SPAC is involved), but he did say he has new ‘clarity’ going forward.The fact that fintech is bullish on the future of fintech isn’t quite surprising. I will say that while one deal can never make or break a sector, a flopped merger certainly can surface the current temperature in the market. Startups Weekly readers will remember last week’s edition about how P&G’s decision not to acquire Billie could hurt DTC exit opportunities. Fintech seems unbothered and, in fact, celebratory. The only counterargument I got, via Twitter DM, is that it could set a bad precedent on big fintech mergers.“Or maybe…corporations learn from this and look to make riskier acquisitions earlier in a company’s lifecycle because they know that if they let the company get too big they’ll lose the chance,” Rami Essaid, founder of Finmark, told me.Only in 2021 could a $5.3 billion break-up and a DOJ investigation be considered a blessing. Rock on, ‘Plaid for X’ startups.Before we go on, make sure to follow me on Twitter for my bad jokes and early-stage startup coverage. You can also always reach me at natasha.m@techcrunch.com.Columbus is the new Miami which is new the San FranciscoI hope that sub-hed gave you a headache, because that’s exactly what debates about where the best place to start a company do to me. The rise of Work From Anywhere has emboldened VCs to leave San Francisco for markets such as Miami or Austin in search of the next unsung hero of their portfolios.For investors, though, the financial benefit of moving to an emerging market might not be apparent within months, but instead years. Venture is a long game (at least most of the time).Here’s what to know, per Silicon Valley editor Connie Loizos: Drive Capital, a venture capital firm based in Columbus, Ohio, and started by two ex-Sequoia investors now has over $1.2 billion in assets. But before it had breakout companies like Root and Olive AI, Drive had to play the unusual role of investing in a region without key investing infrastructure.Etc: Founding partner Chris Olsen explained how they set up their roots:“We’ve had to spend a lot of time going into the universities and putting new seed managers in business and helping them fundraise and sort of building all of this infrastructure from scratch so that the next entrepreneur is out here [versus moves away], and it works. In our first year, we had inbound interest from 1,800 [startups], then it went to about 3,000 and now it’s up to about 7,000, which is more than I’ve heard any other venture firms say that they see in California. And I don’t think it’s because we’re great. I think that’s more [a reflection of the] scale of the opportunity that’s here now. One of the things that we would love to see more of is more venture capitalists coming here, because there’s certainly more opportunity than we can invest in.”Image Credits: Paula Dani/ABlse (opens in a new window) / Getty ImagesThe CFO Tech StackIf you want to start a company, go to a startup and look where employees are still using an Excel sheet. The best products are the ones fueled by frustrations, right?Here’s what to know per managing editor Danny Crichton: For a trio of Palantir alums, 15 collective years at the now-public government tech company showed a huge gap in technology for CFOs. So, they started Mosaic, a techstack to help financial officers better communicate and perform their jobs.Etc: Co-founder Bijan Moallemi describes the mistake other platforms are making:“Everyone wants to be strategic, but it’s so tough to do because 80% of your time is pulling data from these disparate systems, cleaning it, mapping it, updating your Excel files, and maybe 20% of [your time] is actually taking a step back and understanding what the data is telling you.”Image via Getty Images / alashiThe future of consumer hardware startups beyond PelotonAre wearables still exciting? Is consumer hardware ever going to get easier to pull off? What was the strategy that made Peloton so successful?These questions and more are answered in the latest consumer hardware-focused Extra Crunch Survey, which brings together VCs from SOSV, Lux Capital, Shasta Ventures, and more.Here’s what to know: Everyone is studying the Peloton success recipe. But the big question for consumer hardware startups is if the at-home fitness market’s boom is translating to other use cases.Etc: Cyril Ebersweiler of SOSV noted that supply chain distribution disruption during COVID-19 has been difficult for category startups, but the need for innovative solutions has never been more clear.“Everybody is waiting for new and mind-blowing experiences, and I guess we’ve all experienced the shortcomings or the magic of some IoT products over the shelter-in-place [orders].

https://t.co/HDg0bbs31a,2021-01-16T17:15:16,Startups look beyond lidar for autonomous vehicle perception,"['Last CES was a time of reckoning for lidar companies, many of which were cratering due to a lack of demand from a (still) nonexistent autonomous vehicle industry. The few that excelled did so by specializing, and this year the trend has pushed beyond lidar, with new sensing and imaging methods pushing to both compete with and complement the laser-based tech.Lidar pushed ahead of traditional cameras because it could do things they couldn’t — and now some companies are pushing to do the same with tech that’s a little less exotic.As autonomy stalls, lidar companies learn to adaptA good example of addressing the problem or perception by different means is Eye Net’s vehicle-to-x tracking platform. This is one of those techs that’s been talked about in the context of 5G (admittedly still somewhat exotic), which for all the hype really does enable short-distance, low-latency applications that could be life-savers.Eye Net provides collision warnings between vehicles equipped with its tech, whether they have cameras or other sensing tech equipped or not. The example they provide is a car driving through a parking lot, unaware that a person on one of those horribly unsafe electric scooters is moving perpendicular to it ahead, about to zoom into its path but totally obscured by parked cars. Eye Net’s sensors detect the position of the devices on both vehicles and send warnings in time for either or both to brake.Image Credits: Eye NetThey’re not the only ones attempting something like this, but they hope that by providing a sort of white-label solution, a good size network can be built relatively easily, instead of having none, and then all VWs equipped, and then some Fords and some e-bikes, and so on.But vision is still going to be a major part of how vehicles navigate, and advances are being made on multiple fronts.Brightway Vision, for instance, addresses the issue of normal RGB cameras having limited visibility in many real-world conditions by going multispectral. In addition to ordinary visible-light imagery, the company’s camera is mated to a near-infrared beamer that scans the road ahead at set distance intervals many times a second.Image Credits: Brightway VisionThe idea is that if the main camera can’t see 100 feet out because of fog, the NIR imagery will still catch any obstacles or road features when it scans that “slice” in its regular sweep of the incoming area. It combines the benefits of traditional cameras with those of IR ones, but manages to avoid the shortcomings of both. The pitch is that there’s no reason to use a normal camera when you can use one of these, which does the same job better and may even allow another sensor to be cut out.Foresight Automotive also uses multispectral imagery in its cameras (chances are hardly any vehicle camera will be limited to visible spectrum in a few years), dipping into thermal via a partnership with FLIR, but what it’s really selling is something else.To provide 360-degree (or close) coverage, generally multiple cameras are required. But where those cameras go differs on a compact sedan versus an SUV from the same manufacturer — let alone on an autonomous freight vehicle. Because those cameras have to work together, they need to be perfectly calibrated, aware of the exact position of the others, so they know, for example, that they’re both looking at the same tree or bicyclist and not two identical ones.Image Credits: Foresight AutomotiveForesight’s advance is to simplify the calibration stage, so a manufacturer or designer or test platform doesn’t need to be laboriously retested and certified every time the cameras need to be moved half an inch in one direction or the other. The Foresight demo shows them sticking the cameras on the roof of the car seconds before driving it.It has parallels to another startup called Nodar that also relies on stereoscopic cameras, but takes a different approach. The technique of deriving depth from binocular triangulation, as the company points out, goes back decades, or millions of years if you count our own vision system, which works in a similar ways. The limitation that has held this approach back isn’t that optical cameras fundamentally can’t provide the depth information needed by an autonomous vehicle, but that they can’t be trusted to remain calibrated.Nodar shows that its paired stereo cameras don’t even need to be mounted to the main mass of the car, which would reduce jitter and fractional mismatches between the cameras’ views. Attached to the rearview mirrors, their “Hammerhead” camera setup has a wide stance (like the shark’s), which provides improved accuracy because of the larger disparity between the cameras. Since distance is determined by the differences between the two images, there’s no need for object recognition or complex machine learning to say “this is a shape, probably a car, probably about this big, which means it’s probably about this far away” as you might with a single camera solution.Image Credits: Nodar“The industry has already shown that camera arrays do well in harsh weather conditions, just as human eyes do,” said Nodar COO and co-founder Brad Rosen. “For example, engineers at Daimler have published results showing that current stereoscopic approaches provide significantly more stable depth estimates than monocular methods and lidar completion in adverse weather. The beauty of our approach is that the hardware we use is available today, in automotive-grade, and with many choices for manufacturers and distributors.”Indeed, a major strike against lidar has been the cost of the unit — even “inexpensive” ones tend to be orders of magnitude more expensive than ordinary cameras, something that adds up very quickly. But team lidar hasn’t been standing still either.Sense Photonics came onto the scene with a new approach that seemed to combine the best of both worlds: A relatively cheap and simple flash lidar (as opposed to spinning or scanning, which tend to add complexity) mated to a traditional camera so that the two see versions of the same image, allowing them to work together in identifying objects and establishing distances.Sense Photonics flashes onto the lidar scene with a new approach and $26MSince its debut in 2019 Sense has refined its tech for production and beyond. The latest advance is custom hardware that has enabled it to image objects out to 200 meters — generally considered on the far end both for lidar and traditional cameras.“In the past, we have sourced an off-the-shelf detector to pair with our laser source (Sense Illuminator). However, our two years of in-house detector development has now completed and is a huge success, which allows us to build short-range and long-range automotive products,” said CEO Shauna McIntyre.“Sense has created ‘building blocks’ for a camera-like lidar design that can be paired with different sets of optics to achieve different FOV, range, resolution, etc.,” she continued. “And we’ve done so in a very simple design that can actually be manufactured in large volumes. You can think of our architecture like a DSLR camera where you have the ‘base camera’ and can pair it with a macro lens, zoom lens, fisheye lens, etc. to achieve different functions.”One thing all the companies seemed to agree on is that no single sensing modality will dominate the industry from top to bottom. Leaving aside that the needs of a fully autonomous (i.e., level 4-5) vehicle has very different needs from a driver-assist system, the field moves too quickly for any one approach to remain on top for long.“AV companies cannot succeed if the public is not convinced that their platform is safe and the safety margins only increase with redundant sensor modalities operating at different wavelengths,” said McIntyre.Whether that means visible light, near-infrared, thermal imaging, radar, lidar, or as we’ve seen here, some combination of two or three of these, it’s clear the market will continue to favor differentiation — though as with the boom-bust cycle seen in the lidar industry a few years back, it’s also a warning that consolidation won’t be far behind.']",a potential lawsuit,"['Andrey Suslov / Getty ImagesLast CES', 'Lidar', 'Eye Net’s', 'Eye Net’s', 'Eye NetThey’re', 'Fords', 'Brightway Vision', 'NIR', 'IR', 'Foresight Automotive', 'FLIR', 'Nodar COO', 'Brad Rosen', 'Daimler', 'Sense Illuminator', 'Shauna McIntyre', 'FOV', 'DSLR', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CES', 'Devin Coldewey6:15', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/sveokIKo11,2021-01-16T16:00:01,"This Week in Apps: Parler deplatformed, alt apps rise, looking back at 2020 trends","['Welcome back to This Week in\xa0Apps,\xa0the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.The app industry is as hot as ever, with\xa0a record 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.Consumers last year also spent 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a combined $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors poured $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.Top StoriesThe right-wing gets deplatformedLast weekend, Google and Apple removed Parler from their respective app stores, the latter after first giving the app 24 hours to come up with a new moderation strategy to address the threats of violence and illegal activity taking place on the app in the wake of the Capitol riot. When Parler failed to take adequate measures, the app was pulled down.What happened afterwards was unprecedented. All of Parler’s technology backend services providers pulled support for Parler, too, including Amazon AWS (which has led to a lawsuit), Stripe and even Okta, which Parler was only using as a free trial. Other vendors also refused to do business with the app, potentially ending its ability to operate for good.Parler is officially offline after AWS suspensionBut although Parler is down, its data lives on. Several efforts have been made to archive Parler data for posterity — and for tipping off the FBI. Gizmodo made a map using the GPS data of 70,000 Parler posts. Another effort, Y’all Qaeda, is also using location data to map videos from Parler to locations around the Capitol building.These visualizations are possible because the data itself was quickly archived by internet archivist @donk_enby before Parler was taken down, and because Parler stored rich metadata with each user’s post. That means each user’s precise location was recorded when they uploaded their photos and videos to the app.It’s a gold mine for investigators and a further indication of the privilege these rioters believed they had to avoid prosecution or the extent to which they were willing to throw their life away for their cause — the false reality painted for them by Trump, his allies and other outlets that repeated the “big lie” until they truly believed only a revolution could save our democracy.The deplatforming of President TrumpThe move to kick Parler offline followed the broader deplatforming of Trump, who’s accused of inciting the violence, in part by his refusal to concede and his continued lies about a “rigged election.” As a result, Trump has been deplatformed across social platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitch, YouTube, Reddit, Discord and Snapchat, while e-commerce platform Shopify kicked out Trump merch shops and PayPal refused to process transactions for some groups of Trump supporters.Alternative social apps post gains following Capitol riotParler was the most high-profile app used by the Capitol rioters, but others found themselves compromised by the same crowd. Walkie-talkie app Zello, for instance, was used by some insurrectionists during the January 6 riot to communicate. Telegram, meanwhile, recently had to block dozens of hardcore hate channels that were threatening violence, including those led by Nazis (which were reported for years with no action by the company, some claim).Now, many in the radical right are moving to new platforms outside of the mainstream. Immediately following the Capitol riot, MeWe, CloutHub and other privacy-focused rivals to big tech began topping the app stores, alongside the privacy-focused messengers Signal and Telegram. YouTube alternative Rumble also gained ground due to recent events. Right-wingers even mistakenly downloaded the wrong “Parlor” app and a local newspaper app they thought was the uncensored social network Gab. (They’re not always the brightest bulbs.)Following riots, alternative social apps and private messengers top the app storesThis could soon prove to be another difficult situation for the platforms to address, as we already came across highly concerning posts distributed on MeWe, which had used extreme hate speech or threatened violence. MeWe claims it moderates its content, but its recent growth to now 15 million users may be making that difficult — especially since it’s inheriting the former Parler users, including the radical far-right. The company has not been able to properly moderate the content, which may make it the next to be gone.2020 annual reviewApp Annie this week released its annual review of the mobile app industry finding (as noted above) that mobile app downloads grew by 7% year-over-year to a record 218 billion in 2020. Consumer spending also grew by 20% to also hit a new milestone of $143 billion, led by markets that included China, the United States, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Consumers spent 3.5 trillion minutes on Android devices in 2020. Meanwhile, U.S. users now spend more time in apps (four hours) than watching live TV (3.7 hours).The full report examines other key trends across social, gaming, finance, e-commerce, video and streaming, mobile food ordering, business apps, edtech and much more. We pulled out some highlights here, such as TikTok’s chart-topping year by downloads, the rise in livestreamed and social shopping, consumers spending 40% more time streaming on mobile YoY and other key trends.App stores saw record 218 billion downloads in 2020, consumer spend of $143 billionSensor Tower also released its own annual report, which specifically explored the impact of COVID-19; the growth in business apps, led by Zoom; mobile gaming; and the slow recovery of travel apps, among other things.Samsung reveals its new flagshipsImage Credits: SamsungThough not “apps” news per se, it’s worth making note of what’s next in the Android ecosystem of high-end devices. This week was Samsung’s Unpacked press event, where the company revealed its latest flagship devices and other products. The big news was Samsung’s three new phones and their now lower prices: the glass-backed Galaxy S21 ($799) and S21 Plus ($999), and the S21 Ultra ($1,199), which is S Pen compatible.The now more streamlined camera systems are the key feature of the new phones, and include:S21 and S21 Plus: A 12-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel wide and 64-megapixel telephoto with 30x space zoom.S21 Ultra: A 12-megapixel ultra-wide, 108-megapixel wide and, for the first time, a dual-telephoto lens system with 3x and 10x optical zoom. The Ultra also improves low-light shooting with its Bright Night sensor.The devices support UWB and there’s a wild AI-powered photo feature that lets you tap to remove people from the background of your photos. (How well it works is TBD). Other software imaging updates allow you to pull stills from 8K shooting, better image stabilization and a new “Vlogger view” for shooting from front and back cameras as the same time.Also launched were Samsung’s AirPods rival, the Galaxy Buds Pro, and its Tile rival, the Galaxy SmartTag.Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro are a solid AirPods alternative\xa0Weekly NewsPlatforms: AppleApple releases second iOS 14.2 developer beta.

https://t.co/q5CNv7yZce,2021-01-16T12:00:56,Checkout wants to be Rapyd and Fast,"['Hello and welcome back to\xa0Equity, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. We’re back on this lovely Saturday with a bonus episode!Again!There is enough going on that to avoid failing to bring you stuff that we think matters, we are back yet again for more. This time around we are not talking Roblox, we’re talking about e-commerce, and a number of rounds — big and small — that have been raised in the space. Honest question: Do y’all plan to release news on the same week? Are trends a social construct?From Natasha, Grace, Danny and your humble servant, here’s your run-down:Webflow raised $140 million in a round that it says it did not need. This is not a new thing. Some startups are doing well, and don’t burn much. So investors offer them more at a nice price. In this case $2.1 billion. (Webflow does no-code websites.)Checkout.com raised $450 million. The rich really do get richer. In this case the founders of Checkout.com, whose company is now worth around $15 billion. Checkout.com does, you guessed, online checkout work. Which as Danny explains is complicated and critical.We also talked about this Bolt round, for context.And sticking to the e-commerce theme, Rapyd raised $300 million at around a $2.5 billion valuation. There is infinite money available for late-stage fintech.Early stage as well, it turns out, with Tradeswell raising $15.5 million to help businesses improve their net margins.Finally, ending with a chat on infrastructure, Nacelle closed an $18 million Series A.\xa0And now we’re going back to bed.Equity drops every Monday at 7:00 a.m. PST and Thursday afternoon as fast as we can get it out, so subscribe to us on\xa0Apple Podcasts,\xa0Overcast,\xa0Spotify and all the casts.']",Visa and Plaid calling off their $5.3 billion acquisition agreement,"['Natasha Mascarenhas', 'CommentHello', 'Roblox', 'Natasha, Grace, Danny', 'Webflow', 'Checkout.com', 'Checkout.com', 'Danny', 'Bolt', 'Rapyd', 'Tradeswell', 'Nacelle', 'Series A.', 'PST', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCBoltCheckout.comeCommerceEquity', 'FastAlex Wilhelm', 'Natasha Mascarenhas1:00', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/4jE6dUpRxC,2021-01-15T19:30:43,"WhatsApp delays enforcement of privacy terms by 3 months, following backlash","['WhatsApp said on Friday that it won’t enforce the planned update to its data-sharing policy until May 15, weeks after news about the new terms created confusion among its users, exposed the Facebook app to a potential lawsuit, triggered a nationwide investigation and drove tens of millions of its loyal fans to explore alternative messaging apps.“We’re now moving back the date on which people will be asked to review and accept the terms. No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We’re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,” the firm said in a blog post.The messaging app, which serves more than two billion users, said it was delaying the enforcement of the new terms, which it first unveiled last year, over confusion it has created worldwide. The delay of the planned privacy update is aimed at providing users with more time to review the terms, the company said.WhatsApp faces legal challenge over privacy in its biggest market“We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,” said the company, which earlier this week ran full-page ads on several newspapers in India, where it has amassed over 450 million monthly active users.For years, WhatsApp has been attempting to curb the spread of misinformation on its app. Now, it’s attempting to debunk falsehoods about WhatsApp itself. Image Credits: WhatsAppThrough an in-app alert, WhatsApp had asked users earlier this month to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share with Facebook some personal data about them, such as their phone number and location. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.The change has been mischaracterized by many as their personal communication being compromised, which WhatsApp also clarified this week was not the case. WhatsApp, which Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014, has been sharing some limited information about its users with the social giant since 2016 — and for a period allowed users to opt-out of this.“With these updates, none of that is changing. Instead, the update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services. This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook,” WhatsApp wrote today.Following the backlash, tens of millions of confused and angered users have flocked to Signal and Telegram. As of earlier this week, Signal was the top app on the App Store in 40 nations and Google Play Store in 18.In an interview with TechCrunch earlier this week, Signal co-founder and executive chairman Brian Acton (who also co-founded WhatsApp) said “the smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes. We’re also excited that we are having conversations about online privacy and digital safety and people are turning to Signal as the answer to those questions.”Signal’s Brian Acton talks about exploding growth, monetization and WhatsApp data-sharing outrage']",blog post,"['WhatsApp', 'NavigationClose', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'Signal', 'Signal', 'Brian Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'Signal', 'Brian Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAppsSocialFacebookindiasignalTelegramWhatsAppWhatsApp', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/3IYVzsHxmf,2021-01-15T23:40:23,GitLab oversaw a $195 million secondary sale that values the company at $6 billion,"['GitLab has confirmed with TechCrunch that it oversaw a $195 million secondary sale that values the company at $6 billion. CNBC broke the story earlier today.The company’s impressive valuation comes after its most recent 2019 Series E in which it raised $268 million on a 2.75 billion valuation, an increase of $3.25 billion in under 18 months. Company co-founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij believes the increase is due to his company’s progress adding functionality to the platform.“We believe the increase in valuation over the past year reflects the progress of our complete DevOps platform towards realizing a greater share of the growing, multi-billion dollar software development market,” he told TechCrunch.While the startup has raised over $434 million, this round involved buying employee stock options, a move that allows the company’s workers to cash in some of their equity prior to going public. CNBC reported that the firms buying the stock included Alta Park, HMI Capital, OMERS Growth Equity, TCV and Verition.Scaling to $100 million ARR: 3 founders share their insightsThe next logical step would appear to be IPO, something the company has never shied away from. In fact, it actually at one point included the proposed date of November 18, 2020 as a target IPO date on the company wiki. While they didn’t quite make that goal, Sijbrandij still sees the company going public at some point. He’s just not being so specific as in the past, suggesting that the company has plenty of runway left from the last funding round and can go public when the timing is right.“We continue to believe that being a public company is an integral part of realizing our mission. As a public company, GitLab would benefit from enhanced brand awareness, access to capital, shareholder liquidity, autonomy and transparency,” he said.He added, “That said, we want to maximize the outcome by selecting an opportune time. Our most recent capital raise was in 2019 and contributed to an already healthy balance sheet. A strong balance sheet and business model enables us to select a period that works best for realizing our long-term goals.”GitLab has not only published IPO goals on its Wiki, but its entire company philosophy, goals and OKRs for everyone to see. Sijbrandij told TechCrunch’s Alex Wilhelm at a TechCrunch Disrupt panel in September that he believes that transparency helps attract and keep employees. It doesn’t hurt that the company was and remains a fully remote organization, even pre-COVID.“We started [this level of] transparency to connect with the wider community around GitLab, but it turned out to be super beneficial for attracting great talent as well,” Sijbrandij told Wilhelm in September.The company, which launched in 2014, offers a DevOps platform to help move applications through the programming lifecycle.GitLab hauls in $268M Series E on 2.75B valuationUpdate: The original headline of this story has been changed from ‘GitLab raises $195M in secondary funding on $6 billion valuation.’\xa0']",UBTech launches UV light disinfecting robots,"['NavigationClose', 'CNBC', 'Sid Sijbrandij', 'DevOps', 'CNBC', 'Alta Park', 'HMI Capital', 'Verition', 'ARR', 'Sijbrandij', 'GitLab', 'Sijbrandij', 'Alex Wilhelm', 'GitLab', 'Sijbrandij', 'DevOps', 'GitLab', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CNBC', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/4KOXE3UJXi,2021-01-16T01:09:47,"Extra Crunch roundup: Antitrust jitters, SPAC odyssey, white-hot IPOs, more","[""Some time ago, I gave up on the idea of finding a thread that connects each story in the weekly Extra Crunch roundup; there are no unified theories of technology news.The stories that left the deepest impression were related to two news pegs that dominated the week — Visa and Plaid calling off their $5.3 billion acquisition agreement, and sizzling-hot IPOs for Affirm and Poshmark.Watching Plaid and Visa sing “Let’s Call The Whole Thing Off” in harmony after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to block their deal wasn’t shocking. But I was surprised to find myself editing an interview Alex Wilhelm conducted with Plaid CEO Zach Perret the next day in which the executive said growing the company on its own is “once again” the correct strategy.Full Extra Crunch articles are only available to membersUse discount code ECFriday to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscriptionIn an analysis for Extra Crunch, Managing Editor Danny Crichton suggested that federal regulators’ new interest in antitrust enforcement will affect valuations going forward. For example, Procter & Gamble and women’s beauty D2C brand Billie also called off their planned merger last week after the Federal Trade Commission raised objections in December.Given the FTC’s moves last year to prevent Billie and Harry’s from being acquired, “it seems clear that U.S. antitrust authorities want broad competition for consumers in household goods,” Danny concluded, and I suspect that applies to Plaid as well.In December, C3.ai, Doordash and Airbnb burst into the public markets to much acclaim. This week, used clothing marketplace Poshmark saw a 140% pop in its first day of trading and consumer-financing company Affirm “priced its IPO above its raised range\xa0at $49 per share,” reported Alex.In a post titled “A theory about the current IPO market”, he identified eight key ingredients for brewing a debut with a big first-day pop, which includes “exist in a climate of near-zero interest rates” and “keep companies private longer.” Truly, words to live by!Come back next week for more coverage of the public markets in The Exchange, an interview with Bustle CEO Bryan Goldberg where he shares his plans for taking the company public, a comprehensive post that will unpack the regulatory hurdles facing D2C consumer brands, and much more.If you live in the U.S., enjoy your MLK Day holiday weekend, and wherever you are: Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch.Walter Thompson\nSenior Editor, TechCrunch@yourprotagonistI'm taking the credit/blame for this headline https://t.co/2KYLsTxeHq— Walter Thompson (@YourProtagonist) January 12, 2021\xa0Rapid growth in 2020 reveals OKR software market’s untapped potentialImage Credits: Nigel Sussman (opens in a new window)After spending much of the week covering 2021’s frothy IPO market, Alex Wilhelm devoted this morning’s column to studying the OKR-focused software sector.Measuring objectives and key results are core to every enterprise, perhaps more so these days since knowledge workers began working remotely in greater numbers last year.A sign of the times: This week, enterprise orchestration SaaS platform Gtmhub announced that it raised a $30 million Series B.To get a sense of how large the TAM is for OKR, Alex reached out to several companies and asked them to share new and historical growth metrics:GthmhubPerdooWorkBoardAlly.ioKoanWeekDone“Some OKR-focused startups didn’t get back to us, and some leaders wanted to share the best stuff off the record, which we grant at times for candor amongst startup executives,” he wrote.Rapid growth in 2020 reveals OKR software market’s untapped potential5 consumer hardware VCs share their 2021 investment strategiesImage Credits: Ezra Shaw (opens in a new window)For our latest investor survey, Matt Burns interviewed five VCs who actively fund consumer electronics startups:Hans Tung, managing partner, GGV CapitalDayna Grayson, co-founder and general partner, Construct CapitalCyril Ebersweiler, general partner, SOSVBilal Zuberi, partner, Lux CapitalRob Coneybeer, managing director, Shasta Ventures“Consumer hardware has always been a tough market to crack, but the COVID-19 crisis made it even harder,” says Matt, noting that the pandemic fueled wide interest in fitness startups like Mirror, Peloton and Tonal.Bonus: Many VCs listed the founders, investors and companies that are taking the lead in consumer hardware innovation.5 consumer hardware VCs share their 2021 investment strategiesA theory about the current IPO marketImage Credits: Getty Images/Andriy OnufriyenkoIf you’re looking for insight into “why everything feels so damn silly this year” in the public markets, a post Alex wrote Thursday afternoon might offer some perspective.As someone who pays close attention to late-stage venture markets, he’s identified eight factors that are pushing debuts for unicorns like Affirm and Poshmark into the stratosphere.TL;DR?

At this point, that includes any content connected to the “Stop the Steal” movement perpetuating the rampant lie that Biden’s victory is illegitimate. Those groups continued to thrive on Facebook until measures the company took at the beginning of this week.Facebook will apparently also be putting new restrictions in place for U.S. users who repeatedly break the company’s rules, including barring those accounts from livestreaming videos, events and group pages.Those precautions fall short of what some of Facebook’s critics have called for, but they’re still notable measures for a company that only began taking dangerous conspiracies and armed groups seriously in the last year.Facebook says it will remove references to ‘stop the steal’ across its platform""]",took over,"['NavigationClose ScreenFacebook', 'Hatmaker@tayhatmaker', 'Spencer Platt/Getty Images / Getty ImagesAs', 'Joe Biden’s', 'Facebook Policy Communications', 'Andy Stone', 'Andy Stone', 'Biden', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Hatmaker1:28', 'Joe Biden’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/NKP2aUoEaU,2021-01-15T23:23:18,The pandemic was top of mind in the tech of CES 2021,"['Of course COVID-19 was bound to be an unavoidable topic during the first-ever all-virtual CES. After all, the topic is at front of mind regardless of the topic these days. Close to a year into the pandemic, presenters still understandably feel obligated to address the always-present elephant in the room. Sometimes it was as simple as acknowledging the strangeness of moving from the Las Vegas Convention Center to a Microsoft-powered virtual venue. Other times it felt far more forced.When it comes to the technology itself, there’s no doubt that the pandemic is going to have a profound effect on the industry for years to come, from health measures to remote work setups. Sometimes it’s a genuinely organic evolution aimed at adapting technology to an ever-changing world. In other cases, it can feel far more exploitative — like the consumer electronics equivalent to a beer commercial discussing “these uncertain times.”UBTech launches UV light disinfecting robotsI’ve written a lot about how the pandemic will impact robotics and AI going forward. The short version is that companies will no doubt be more enthusiastic about embracing these technologies, after bumping up against the limitations of a human workforce with a deadly and highly contagious virus spreading across the world.We saw some glimpses of robotics’ response. Though there tends to be a far longer lead time than in the consumer category. The clearest and most immediate example had to be the prevalence of UV outfitted robotics. LG, Ubtech and Ava Robotics all bombarded my inbox with their take on the category. The desire for disinfecting technology should be clear during a pandemic, and robotics offer both a way to automate a dull and repetitious process like this, while removing a potential human viral vector from the equation.Image Credits: RazerUV disinfecting made appearances in a number of other form factors. Phones have been a target for the tech for a few years now. After all, it didn’t take COVID-19 to teach us that smartphones are mobile petri dishes we watch TikToks on. Products like CleanPhone from Canadian startup Glissner are looking to enter a space that’s been thus far dominated by PhoneSoap, which was genuinely ahead of the curve on the phenomenon.Targus’s keyboard may well have been the most widely reported-on UV solution of the show, because, well, it’s a bit wacky, with an ultraviolet lamp that sits above it.Masks are another piece of the puzzle that have slowly been infiltrating the show, but really hit a fever pitch this year. Obviously wearing a face mask in public is only a new phenomenon in some countries — in other parts of the world like East Asia it’s long been a normal part of life. Last year, Portland-based Ao Air grabbed some headlines with its own take on the category.Microsoft’s latest business-focused Surface is focused on remote workRazer’s Project Hazel was undoubtedly the most prominent mask to debut at the show. It’s big and flashy and a bit of a diversion for a company that primarily trades in gaming peripherals. The N95 mask sports LEDs to indicate charging status and make the wearer’s face visible in dark surroundings. There’s also technology built in to make the wearer’s voice clearer. For the moment, however, it’s hard to see them as much beyond a headline grabber.One piece I genuinely expected to see more of was remote work. We caught glimpses, like the Dell monitor with Microsoft Teams conferencing built in. Microsoft pitched its new Surface as a remote work machine, but frankly, it didn’t feel any more targeted at that vertical than any other portable Surface.Dell monitors embrace video calls with pop-up webcams and Teams buttons built inNo doubt many of the innovations companies are working on will have to wait until CES 2022. Fingers crossed, we’ll see them next year in Vegas.']",legal threats,"['NavigationClose', 'COVID-19', 'the Las Vegas Convention Center', 'Microsoft', 'AI', 'Ubtech', 'Ava Robotics', 'CleanPhone', 'PhoneSoap', 'Microsoft’s', 'Surface', 'Project Hazel', 'N95', 'Dell', 'Microsoft Teams', 'Microsoft', 'Surface', 'Surface', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'COVID-19', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/6qeH7HpDA4,2021-01-15T22:52:57,Twitter’s decentralized future,"['This week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey finally responded publicly to the company’s decision to ban President Trump from its platform, writing that Twitter had “faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance” and that he did not “feel pride” about the decision. In the same thread, he took time to call out a nascent Twitter-sponsored initiative called “bluesky,” which is aiming to build up an “open decentralized standard for social media” that Twitter is just one part of.Researchers involved with bluesky reveal to TechCrunch an initiative still in its earliest stages that could fundamentally shift the power dynamics of the social web.Bluesky is aiming to build a “durable” web standard that will ultimately ensure that platforms like Twitter have less centralized responsibility in deciding which users and communities have a voice on the internet. While this could protect speech from marginalized groups, it may also upend modern moderation techniques and efforts to prevent online radicalization.Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chief executive officer of Twitter Inc., arrives after a break during a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018. Republicans pressed Dorsey for what they said may be the “shadow-banning” of conservatives during the hearing. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWhat is bluesky?Just as Bitcoin lacks a central bank to control it, a decentralized social network protocol operates without central governance, meaning Twitter would only control its own app built on bluesky, not other applications on the protocol. The open and independent system would allow applications to see, search and interact with content across the entire standard. Twitter hopes that the project can go far beyond what the existing Twitter API offers, enabling developers to create applications with different interfaces or methods of algorithmic curation, potentially paying entities across the protocol like Twitter for plug-and-play access to different moderation tools or identity networks.A widely adopted, decentralized protocol is an opportunity for social networks to “pass the buck” on moderation responsibilities to a broader network, one person involved with the early stages of bluesky suggests, allowing individual applications on the protocol to decide which accounts and networks its users are blocked from accessing.Social platforms like Parler or Gab could theoretically rebuild their networks on bluesky, benefitting from its stability and the network effects of an open protocol. Researchers involved are also clear that such a system would also provide a meaningful measure against government censorship and protect the speech of marginalized groups across the globe.Bluesky’s current scope is firmly in the research phase, people involved tell TechCrunch, with about 40-50 active members from different factions of the decentralized tech community surveying the software landscape and putting together proposals for what the protocol should ultimately look like. Twitter has told early members that it hopes to hire a project manager in the coming weeks to build out an independent team that will start crafting the protocol itself.A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the initiative.Bluesky’s initial members were invited by Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal early last year. It was later determined that the group should open the conversation up to folks representing some of the more recognizable decentralized network projects, including Mastodon and ActivityPub, which joined the working group hosted on the secure chat platform Element.Jay Graber, founder of decentralized social platform Happening, was paid by Twitter to write up a technical review of the decentralized social ecosystem, an effort to “help Twitter evaluate the existing options in the space,” she tells TechCrunch.“If [Twitter] wanted to design this thing, they could have just assigned a group of guys to do it, but there’s only one thing that this little tiny group of people could do better than Twitter, and that’s not be Twitter,” said Golda Velez, another member of the group who works as a senior software engineer at Postmates and co-founded civ.works, a privacy-centric social\xa0network for civic engagement.The group has had some back and forth with Twitter executives on the scope of the project, eventually forming a Twitter-approved list of goals for the initiative. They define the challenges that the bluesky protocol should seek to address while also laying out what responsibilities are best left to the application creators building on the standard.Image: TechCrunchWho is involvedThe pain points enumerated in the document, viewed by TechCrunch, encapsulate some of Twitter’s biggest shortcomings. They include “how to keep controversy and outrage from hijacking virality mechanisms,” as well as a desire to develop “customizable mechanisms” for moderation, though the document notes that the applications, not the overall protocol, are “ultimately liable for compliance, censorship, takedowns etc.”“I think the solution to the problem of algorithms isn’t getting rid of algorithms — because sorting posts chronologically is an algorithm — the solution is to make it an open pluggable system by which you can go in and try different algorithms and see which one suits you or use the one that your friends like,” says Evan Henshaw-Plath, another member of the working group. He was one of Twitter’s earliest employees and has been building out his own decentralized social platform called Planetary.His platform is based on the secure scuttlebutt protocol, which allows users to browse networks offline in an encrypted fashion. Early on, Planetary had been in talks with Twitter for a corporate investment as well as a personal investment from CEO Jack Dorsey, Henshaw-Plath says, but the competitive nature of the platform prompted some concern among Twitter’s lawyers and Planetary ended up receiving an investment from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone’s venture fund Future Positive. Stone did not respond to interview requests.After agreeing on goals, Twitter had initially hoped for the broader team to arrive at some shared consensus, but starkly different viewpoints within the group prompted Twitter to accept individual proposals from members. Some pushed Twitter to outright adopt or evolve an existing standard while others pushed for bluesky to pursue interoperability of standards early on and see what users naturally flock to.One of the developers in the group hoping to bring bluesky onto their standard was Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko, who tells TechCrunch he sees the need for a major shift in how social media platforms operate globally.“Banning Trump was the right decision though it came a little bit too late. But at the same time, the nuance of the situation is that maybe it shouldn’t be a single American company that decides these things,” Rochko tells us.The deplatforming of President TrumpLike several of the other members in the group, Rochko has been skeptical at times about Twitter’s motivation with the bluesky protocol. Shortly after Dorsey’s initial announcement in 2019, Mastodon’s official Twitter account tweeted out a biting critique, writing, “This is not an announcement of reinventing the wheel. This is announcing the building of a protocol that Twitter gets to control, like Google controls Android.”Today, Mastodon is arguably one of the most mature decentralized social platforms. Rochko claims that the network of decentralized nodes has more than 2.3 million users spread across thousands of servers. In early 2017, the platform had its viral moment on Twitter, prompting an influx of “hundreds of thousands” of new users alongside some inquisitive potential investors whom Rochko has rebuffed in favor of a donation-based model.Image Credits: TechCrunchInherent risksNot all of the attention Rochko has garnered has been welcome. In 2019, Gab, a social network favored by right-wing extremists, brought its entire platform onto the Mastodon network after integrating the platform’s open-source code, bringing Mastodon its single biggest web of users and its most undesirable liability all at once.Rochko quickly disavowed the network and aimed to sever its ties to other nodes on the Mastodon platform and convince application creators to do the same. But a central fear of decentralization advocates was quickly realized, as the platform type’s first “success story” was a home for right-wing extremists.Parler is officially offline after AWS suspensionThis fear has been echoed in decentralized communities this week as app store owners and networks have taken another right-wing social network, Parler, off the web after violent content surfaced on the site in the lead-up to and aftermath of riots at the U.S. Capitol, leaving some developers fearful that the social network may set up home on their decentralized standard.“Fascists are 100% going to use peer-to-peer technologies, they already are and they’re going to start using it more… If they get pushed off of mainstream infrastructure or people are surveilling them really closely, they’re going to have added motivation,” said Emmi Bevensee, a researcher studying extremist presences on decentralized networks. “Maybe the far-right gets stronger footholds on peer-to-peer before the people who think the far-right is bad do because they were effectively pushed off.”A central concern is that commoditizing decentralized platforms through efforts like bluesky will provide a more accessible route for extremists kicked off current platforms to maintain an audience and provide casual internet users a less janky path towards radicalization.“Peer-to-peer technology is generally not that seamless right now. Some of it is; you can buy Bitcoin in Cash App now, which, if anything, is proof that this technology is going to become much more mainstream and adoption is going to become much more seamless,” Bevensee told TechCrunch. “In the current era of this mass exodus from Parler, they’re obviously going to lose a huge amount of audience that isn’t dedicated enough to get on IPFS. Scuttlebutt is a really cool technology but it’s not as seamless as Twitter.”Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violenceExtremists adopting technologies that promote privacy and strong encryption is far from a new phenomenon, encrypted chat apps like Signal and Telegram have been at the center of such controversies in recent years. Bevensee notes the tendency of right-wing extremist networks to adopt decentralized network tech has been “extremely demoralizing” to those early developer communities — though she notes that the same technologies can and do benefit “marginalized people all around the world.”Though people connected to bluesky’s early moves see a long road ahead for the protocol’s development and adoption, they also see an evolving landscape with Parler and President Trump’s recent deplatforming that they hope will drive other stakeholders to eventually commit to integrating with the standard.“Right at this moment I think that there’s going to be a lot of incentive to adopt, and I don’t just mean by end users, I mean by platforms, because Twitter is not the only one having these really thorny moderation problems,” Velez says. “I think people understand that this is a critical moment.”']", issued a statement,"['Twitter’s', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Twitter', 'Jack Dorsey', 'Trump', 'Bluesky', 'Jack Dorsey', 'Twitter Inc.', 'House Energy and Commerce Committee', 'Dorsey', 'Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg', 'Getty ImagesWhat', 'Bitcoin', 'Parler', 'Gab', 'Twitter', 'Bluesky’s', 'Mastodon', 'ActivityPub', 'Jay Graber', 'Twitter', 'Golda Velez', 'civ.works', 'Twitter’s', 'Evan Henshaw-Plath', 'Twitter’s', 'Jack Dorsey', 'Henshaw-Plath', 'Twitter’s', 'Biz Stone’s', 'Future Positive', 'Twitter', 'Mastodon', 'Eugen Rochko', 'Rochko', 'TrumpLike', 'Rochko', 'Twitter’s', 'Dorsey’s', 'Mastodon', 'Mastodon', 'Rochko', 'Rochko', 'Rochko', 'Gab', 'Mastodon', 'Rochko', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Emmi Bevensee', 'Parler', 'IPFS', 'Scuttlebutt', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'Parler', 'Trump’s', 'Velez', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'ArticleTwitter’s', 'Twitter', 'Jack Dorsey', 'Lucas Matney11:52 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/JlXcv5OzFr,2021-01-15T12:00:11,A security researcher commandeered a country’s expired top-level domain to save it from hackers,"['In mid-October, a little-known but critically important domain name for one country’s internet space began to expire.The domain — scpt-network.com — was one of two nameservers for the .cd country code top-level domain, assigned to the Democratic Republic of Congo. If it fell into the wrong hands, an attacker could redirect millions of unknowing internet users to rogue websites of their choosing.Clearly, a domain of such importance wasn’t supposed to expire; someone in the Congolese government probably forgot to pay for its renewal. Luckily, expired domains don’t disappear immediately. Instead, the clock started on a grace period for its government owners to buy back the domain before it was sold to someone else.By chance, Fredrik Almroth, a security researcher and co-founder of cybersecurity startup Detectify, was already looking at nameservers of country code top-level domains (or ccTLDs), the two-letter suffixes at the end of regional web addresses, like .fr for France or .uk for the United Kingdom. When he found this critical domain name was about to expire, Almroth began to monitor it, assuming someone in the Congolese government would pay to reclaim the domain.But nobody ever did.By the end of December, the clock was almost up and the domain was about to fall off the internet. Within minutes of the domain becoming available, Almroth quickly snapped it up to prevent anyone else from taking it over — because, as he told TechCrunch, “the implications are kind of huge.”It’s rare but not unheard of for a top-level domain to expire.In 2017, security researcher Matthew Bryant took over the nameservers of the .io top-level domain, assigned to the British Indian Ocean Territory. But malicious hackers have also shown interest in targeting top-level domain hacks into companies and governments that use the same country-based domain suffix. Read more on TechCrunchA new state-backed hacker group is hijacking government domains at a phenomenal paceAmazon’s Ring Neighbors app exposed users’ precise locations and home addressesNSO used real people’s location data to pitch its contact-tracing tech, researchers sayGot a tip? Get in touch.Taking over a nameserver is not supposed to be an easy task because they are a vital part of how the internet works.Every time you visit a website your device relies on a nameserver to convert a web address in your browser to the machine-readable address that tells your device where on the internet to find the site you’re looking for. Some liken nameservers to the phone directory of the internet. Sometimes your browser looks no further than its own cache for the answer, and sometimes it has to ask the nearest nameserver for the answer. But the nameservers that control top-level domains are considered authoritative and know where to look without having to ask another nameserver.With control of an authoritative nameserver, malicious hackers could run man-in-the-middle attacks to silently intercept and redirect to malicious webpages internet users going to legitimate sites.These kinds of attacks have been used in sophisticated espionage campaigns aimed at cloning websites to trick victims into handing over their passwords, which hackers use to get access to company networks to steal information.Worse, Almroth said with control of the nameserver it was possible to obtain valid SSL (HTTPS) certificates, allowing for an attacker to intercept encrypted web traffic or any email mailbox for any .cd domain, he said. To the untrained eye, a successful attacker could redirect victims to a spoofed website, and they would be none the wiser.“If you can abuse the validation schemes used to issue certificates, you can undermine the SSL of any domain under .cd as well,” Almroth said. “The capabilities of being in such a privileged position is scary.”Almroth ended up sitting on the domain for about a week as he tried to figure out a way to hand it back. By this point the domain had been inactive for two months already and nothing had catastrophically broken. At most, websites with a .cd domain might have taken slightly longer to load.Since the remaining nameserver was running normally, Almroth kept the domain offline so that whenever an internet user tried to access a domain that relied on the nameserver under his control, it would automatically timeout and pass the request to the remaining nameserver.In the end, the Congolese government didn’t bother asking for the domain back. It spun up an entirely new but similarly named domain — scpt-network.net — to replace the one now in Almroth’s possession.We reached out to the Congolese authorities for comment but did not hear back.ICANN, the international nonprofit organization responsible for internet address allocation, said country code top-level domains are operated by their respective countries and its role is “very limited,” a spokesperson said.For its part, ICANN encouraged countries to follow best practices and to use DNSSEC, a cryptographically more secure technology that makes it nearly impossible to serve up spoofed websites. One network security engineer who asked not to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media questioned whether DNSSEC would be effective at all against a top-level domain hijack.At least in this case, it’s nothing a calendar reminder can’t solve.A new state-backed hacker group is hijacking government domains at a phenomenal pace']",Share on Twitter ,"['NavigationClose', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Fredrik Almroth', 'Matthew Bryant', 'the British Indian Ocean Territory', 'Almroth’s', 'ICANN', 'ICANN', 'DNSSEC', 'DNSSEC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CongoDetectifydomain', 'KingdomFeatured', 'Zack Whittaker1:00', '2021Gridware', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/3NEvf4RpYZ,2021-01-15T21:06:19,Coinbase commits to a ‘better customer experience’ following complaints,"['Coinbase has a problem. As interest in Bitcoin has soared along with its price, the popular cryptocurrency exchange has found itself the target of a growing spate of angry customers who haven’t been able to access customer service.A quick look at Twitter tells the story. As one upset user of the service ranted earlier today: “Multiple issues over the last month which cost me $$$ several open cases and 0% response?? When are you going to help me or is it easier to just forget. This wont be so easy when your publicly traded. Will be following up with [SEC] soon.”There are many (many) similar complaints to be found.In the interest of full disclosure, this editor asked the company this week for more insight into its customer service operations after emailing its support staff more than a half dozen times and tweeting once over 10 days, and receiving no response. (I bought one unit of Ether in 2018 on the platform and wanted to access my account, which I’d been locked out of nearly two years ago.)To its credit, Coinbase today issued a statement, promising to do better. Its VP of customer success, Casper Sorenson, wrote on the company’s blog that Coinbase is “committing to a better customer experience during this time of heightened interest in the cryptoeconomy.”\xa0 The company says it is adding more people to its team; adding more self-service options (there are startling few); expanding its “help center”; and launching a new educational site, Coinbase Learn, “as a one-stop-shop for first timers, experienced investors, and everyone in between.”Most meaningful perhaps, Coinbase says that in the coming months, it will begin offering live messaging with Coinbase representatives, which is not currently an option. Indeed, Coinbase does not offer live support of any kind. A help support phone line is only available to users wanting to freeze their accounts, and it is automated. (The flip side of its slow customer response times may tie to the apparent seriousness with which Coinbase, which works closely with regulated banks, takes security issues.)Coinbase files to go public confidentially and we’re hypedEither way, the company will have to do far more for its increasingly mainstream users as a publicly traded outfit, both because regulators will undoubtedly take a greater interest in its unhappy customers and because it will otherwise lose existing and potential clients to rivals, of which there are a growing array, from the international payment giant PayPal, which is now seeing record daily cryptocurrency trading, to investment brokers like Robinhood. (Another increasingly popular option: digital asset managers like Grayscale, whose trusts are publicly traded over the counter.)More attention to the issue appears overdue. While Coinbase has presumably been dealing with a surge in complaints that corresponds with the volatility of Bitcoin’s ups and downs, customer service has been an ongoing issue for the nearly nine-year-old, San Francisco outfit, which filed its confidential form with the SEC in December to go public and says it has 35 million users in more than 100 countries.In 2018, Mashable obtained 134 pages of complaints filed to the SEC and the California Department of Business Oversight following a five-month FOIA process, and the picture that emerged was “not of a responsible actor in the cryptocurrency space opening the market to new investors, but rather a company overwhelmed by and underprepared for its own success,” the outlet reported at the time.Asked today, among other things, how Coinbase’s processes have since changed, how many of its more than 1,200 employees are focused on customer support, and whether the outfit could share its latest customer numbers, Coinbase, currently in its SEC-mandated quiet period, declined to comment.Brian Armstrong’s new problem: 60-plus free agentsCoinbase has raised $547.3 million in venture backing over the years, according to Crunchbase. Tiger Global Management, which is currently raising up to $3.75 billion for its newest fund, led Coinbase’s company’s most recent private round, a $300 million Series E financing that closed in 2018 and assigned Coinbase a post-money valuation of $8 billion.Last September, the company parted ways with more than 5% of its employees, after cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong publicly discouraged employee activism and political discussions at work, then offered severance to staffers who were uncomfortable with the policy.Roughly 60 people took the company up on the offer, Coinbase itself later revealed.Coinbase’s IPO has been eagerly anticipated by many, though changes in Washington could potentially have a dampening effect on the company and other exchanges.Coinbase’s own former chief legal officer, Brian Brooks, was last summer appointed as the acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and among his other crypto-friendly efforts, he published interpretive letters and announcements declaring that banks can partner with crypto custodians and conduct payments using stablecoins.It was never entirely clear how much weight those letters and announcements carried. Asked last week about Brooks’s most recent interpretive letter, in which he stated that financial institutions can participate as nodes on a blockchain and store or validate payments, the FDIC said in an emailed response that it had no comment.Asked last week if Brooks’s letter signaled changing U.S. monetary policy, the U.S. Treasury Department did not respond to our press request.Brooks’s reign has ended, in any case. With a new incoming administration, he resigned from his position this week, replaced by a career OCC employee, Blake Paulson, who may himself be replaced in coming weeks. The change leaves question about how and whether the agency’s tone toward cryptocurrency will change.Meanwhile, Gary Gensler, a former financial regulator and Goldman Sachs banker who has most recently been teaching at M.I.T. is expected to be nominated to lead the SEC. He is also expected to welcome greater oversight of the $1 trillion cryptocurrency market than Jay Clayton, the Wall Street attorney who stepped down from the role last month after three years.']",revealed last month,"['NavigationClose ScreenCoinbase', 'complaintsConnie Loizos@cookie / 10:06 PM', 'Dan Kitwood', 'SEC', 'Casper Sorenson', 'Coinbase Learn', 'PayPal', 'Bitcoin’s', 'SEC', 'SEC', 'the California Department of Business Oversight', 'FOIA', 'Coinbase’s', 'SEC', 'Brian Armstrong’s', 'Crunchbase', 'Coinbase’s', 'Brian Armstrong', 'Coinbase’s', 'Brian Brooks', 'the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency', 'OCC', 'Brooks’s', 'FDIC', 'Brooks’s', 'the U.S. Treasury Department', 'Brooks’s', 'OCC', 'Blake Paulson', 'Gary Gensler', 'Goldman Sachs', 'SEC', 'Jay Clayton', 'three years.closePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsCryptocurrencyTCcoinbasecomplaintsCustomer ServiceCoinbase', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/uLnTOWTFKL,2021-01-15T20:37:01,15 steps to fundraising a new VC or private equity fund,"['David TetenContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tDavid Teten is founder of Versatile VC and writes periodically at teten.com and @dteten.\tMore posts by this contributor15 steps to fundraising a new VC or private equity fund12 ‘flexible VCs’ who operate where equity meets revenue shareLaunching is easy; fundraising is harder.I’ve been fortunate to be a partner at two different VC firms over the past nine years, and we’ve grown AUM 10x both times.Based on my experience, taking the 15 steps below will help build the core of a high-performing fundraising and investor relations function.1. Build the firm as much as possible before soliciting LPsThe more baked you are, the more investable you are. The best possible move is to invest in and warehouse some special purpose vehicles that fit your strategy. However, that may distract you from the larger goal of raising a fund, not just a special purpose vehicle.The next best move is to build your core team, e.g., recruit an advisory board, venture partners and EIRs. Lastly, gather feedback. Yohei Nakajima, founder of Untapped.vc, said, “Before pitching LPs and building my firm, I talked with over 50 people I knew to get feedback.”2. Set up a basic marketing toolkit: Deck, website and social mediaIt’s virtually mandatory to develop a detailed, data-backed deck and ideally a video pitch. Your materials should ideally meet the expectations of the Institutional Limited Partners Association, even if you’re not targeting institutions. Keep these documents constantly up to date, so all team members are aligned on key numbers, e.g., total dollars raised so far. You’ll look unprofessional if you’re not coordinated.Fundamentally, almost no one invests based on a deck; they want to talk with the people. However, a high-credibility deck opens the door to a meeting where you then have the chance to sell yourself.Note that limited partners view formatting as a proxy for professionalism. It’s worth investing a little money in a graphic designer who can design a consistent website, business card, logo and presentation templates.Richard Dukas, CEO, Dukas Linden Public Relations, said, “If you don’t have a website and have no material online presence, you likely won’t get past the first hurdle with potential investors.”When you’re fundraising, you’re selling a luxury good. The less widely marketed your fund, the more valuable it is perceived to be. For example, one LP told me she prefers to receive customized emails from fund principals, as opposed to a bulk-mailed quarterly update. An extreme example of this are venture capitalists who don’t even bother with a website, e.g., Benchmark and Thrive Capital. They are the equivalent of a nightclub with an unmarked door, but other investors will need to shape up their social media tech stack.3. Make your online profile data-driven and internally consistentAll team members should have internally consistent and professional profiles on Linkedin at a minimum and typically also on Twitter, Facebook and/or other platforms you use. In particular, highlight the metrics by which you measured your past activities: size of exit, number of people you managed, budget you were responsible for, etc.4. Set up a data room with a completed due diligence questionnaireAmong the most important information to include: details on return history, legal documents, fund organization chart, portfolio construction model, portfolio company one-pagers, key personnel resumes and case studies of past investments. We are using Digify to manage this.5. Prepare FAQs for prospective LPsYou will inevitably receive a wide range of one-off questions from potential LPs. Make sure to compile all your answers in a single document so that you can recycle and refine these answers.']",extended them out to February of 2021,"['VC', 'eExtra Crunch15', 'VC', 'Cristian Bortes/EyeEm', 'David Teten', 'Versatile VC', 'VC', 'VC', 'Yohei Nakajima', 'Untapped.vc', 'the Institutional Limited Partners Association', 'Richard Dukas', 'Dukas Linden Public Relations', 'Benchmark and Thrive Capital', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'eExtra Crunch15', 'VC', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Founded in Germany in 2002, EnvisionTEC specializes in photopolymer additive manufacturing, putting its technology in more direct competition with the likes of 3D printing darling Carbon than Desktop Metal’s own existing portfolio.The deal follows Desktop Metal’s push to go public last August as part of a growing trend of SPAC mergers. Prior to this, the company had raised no shortage of its own funds, with a rapid ascent into unicorn status on the wake of $430 million in investments. It’s spending $300 million to acquire EnvisionTEC through a combination of cash and stock.There’s a lot of potential for Desktop Metal to grow here. EnvisionTEC has the underlying technology with the ability to print in more than 190 materials, and Desktop Metal has the resources to help scale that tech beyond what the German company has been able to build thus far.It’s clear that dental is a pretty huge piece of this puzzle. It’s among the clearest and most immediate use cases for this sort of mass volume 3D printing — and, indeed, the company already sports around 1,000 customers in dental, including companies like Smile Direct Club. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the company effectively tripled its Envision One dental shipments over the previous year.“It’s used for everything from restorations to same-day, full arch implants,” Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop tells TechCrunch. “Usually when you get a denture, you’ve got to wait three weeks for denture implants. This is the first time you’ve got a solution that can do it in the same day. And it’s affordable.”Per a press release issued in the wake of the news, other existing customers include Ford and Hasbro. Fulop says the company will continue to operate as its own division after the acquisition, which is expected to close this quarter.“We’ll be able to leverage their channel,” the executive says. “We look forward to expanding on that capability and using our channel to give them more tools to have a full solution that spans from metal to composites to biomaterials and now photopolymer printing.”Desktop Metal going public in SPAC-led deal that could value 3D printer company at $2.5B']",Twilio,"['Desktop Metal', 'NavigationClose ScreenDesktop Metal', 'Carbon than Desktop Metal’s', 'Desktop Metal’s', 'Desktop Metal', 'Desktop Metal', 'Smile Direct Club', 'Envision One', 'Desktop Metal', 'Ric Fulop', 'Ford', 'Hasbro', 'Fulop', '3D', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'AcquisitionsDesktop Metal', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

No one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8. We’re also going to do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp. We’ll then go to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15,” the firm said in a blog post.The messaging app, which serves more than two billion users, said it was delaying the enforcement of the new terms, which it first unveiled last year, over confusion it has created worldwide. The delay of the planned privacy update is aimed at providing users with more time to review the terms, the company said.WhatsApp faces legal challenge over privacy in its biggest market“We’ve heard from so many people how much confusion there is around our recent update. There’s been a lot of misinformation causing concern and we want to help everyone understand our principles and the facts,” said the company, which earlier this week ran full-page ads on several newspapers in India, where it has amassed over 450 million monthly active users.For years, WhatsApp has been attempting to curb the spread of misinformation on its app. Now, it’s attempting to debunk falsehoods about WhatsApp itself. Image Credits: WhatsAppThrough an in-app alert, WhatsApp had asked users earlier this month to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share with Facebook some personal data about them, such as their phone number and location. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.The change has been mischaracterized by many as their personal communication being compromised, which WhatsApp also clarified this week was not the case. WhatsApp, which Facebook bought for $19 billion in 2014, has been sharing some limited information about its users with the social giant since 2016 — and for a period allowed users to opt-out of this.“With these updates, none of that is changing. Instead, the update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. While not everyone shops with a business on WhatsApp today, we think that more people will choose to do so in the future and it’s important people are aware of these services. This update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook,” WhatsApp wrote today.Following the backlash, tens of millions of confused and angered users have flocked to Signal and Telegram. As of earlier this week, Signal was the top app on the App Store in 40 nations and Google Play Store in 18.In an interview with TechCrunch earlier this week, Signal co-founder and executive chairman Brian Acton (who also co-founded WhatsApp) said “the smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes.

Currently only available for Twitter, Block Party helps people filter out the content they don’t want to see and into what Block Party calls the Lockout Folder. That’s where all of the filtered-out content lives in the event you want to review it later.“We think it’s important to still acknowledge that these people exist,” Chou told me.If you pretend like it doesn’t exist, you might miss out on useful information or genuine connections.“There’s a lot of good stuff that would get lost there,” she said. “There is a reason we use public platforms like Twitter.”On the more negative side, she said, you still may need to check periodically to see if there’s someone threatening your physical safety.Helpers play a big part of the Block Party experience. You can grant a trusted helper access to your Lockout Folder to let you know if there’s anything useful in there, or to simply block the trolls.“It’s a lot easier for someone else to help you process it and flag something that is a concern,” she said. “It’s nice to be able to share that burden. The current design of most of these platforms is to put the burden of dealing with it solely on the person who’s being abused.”The Lockout Folder also serves as a record-keeping tool in the event you need to present evidence of your harassment to a company, a lawyer or someone else.Image Credits: Screenshot/Block Party“It’s really about trying to make people’s lives easier,” Chou said. “It’s just so painful to have to see the abuse again when you’re filing the report.”Block Party emerged from Chou’s own experiences working at platform companies like Facebook and Quora, as well as her experience as an outspoken advocate for diversity and inclusion in tech. At Quora, the block button was one of the first things she built after being harassed on the platform, Chou told me.“There’s that perspective of having been on the inside and seeing how product and engineering teams work,” Chou said. “But also being a DEI activist and seeing how lack of representation on teams has impacted product decisions for the worst.”Although Block Party is only available for Twitter users, the goal is to add other platforms and help folks address harassers that target them across multiple platforms. Block Party is currently free but plans to introduce subscription tiers. Still, Chou said she envisions the free version always existing.To date, Block Party has raised a little less than $1.5 million in funding.

His company has garnered a market cap of almost $60 billion by creating a set of tools to make it easy for programmers to insert a whole host of communications functionality into an application with a couple of lines of code. Given that background, perhaps it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Lawson has written a book called “Ask Your Developer,”\xa0which hit the stores this week. \n\t\t\tLawson’s basic philosophy is that if you can build it, you should.\t\t\t\t\tLawson’s basic philosophy in the book is that if you can build it, you should. In every company, there is build versus buy calculus that goes into every software decision. Lawson believes deeply that there is incredible power in building yourself instead of purchasing something off the shelf. By using components like the ones from his company, and many others delivering specialized types functionality via API, you can build what your customers need instead of just buying what the vendors are giving you.While Lawson recognizes this isn’t always possible, he says that by asking your developers, you can begin to learn when it makes sense to build and when it doesn’t. These discussions should stem from customer problems and companies should seek digital solutions with the input of the developer group.Building great customer experiencesLawson posits that you can build a better customer experience because you understand your customers so much more\xa0 acutely than a generic vendor ever could. “Basically, what you see happening across nearly every industry is that the companies that are able to listen to their customers and hear what the customers need and then build really great digital products and experiences — well, they tend to win the hearts, minds and wallets of their customers,” Lawson told me in an interview about the book this week.Image Credits: Twilio (image has been cropped)He says that this has caused a shift in how companies perceive IT departments. They have gone from cost centers that provision laptops and buy HR software to something more valuable, helping produce digital products that have a direct impact on the business’s bottom line.He uses banking as an example in the book.

Positioning and navigation is obvious every time we open up a maps app, but timing is also a critical function of GPS — offering our smartphones and devices precision timing to ensure that compute processes are accurately synced.As more of the economy relies on these systems, they have increasingly become a target of hackers through GPS spoofing. The government wants to create additional redundancy and resiliency in the sector, and has explored using commercial alternatives to augment or backup parts of the GPS system.Trump administration aims to protect GPS with new exec orderThe Department of Transportation, under a congressional mandate added to the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2018, ran a comprehensive evaluation of commercial alternatives to government-owned and operated GPS that could serve as a backup to our existing infrastructure.Among the 11 companies considered in the study were a number of prominent positioning startups, including Satelles, which raised a $26 million round of capital in 2019; NextNav, which has raised a total of nearly $300 million, including $120 million from Fortress a year ago; and Hellen Systems, which according to Crunchbase raised a small seed round last year.You can read the full report from the DOT, which runs to 457 pages and covers all 14 measures the researchers explored in evaluating these different PNT platforms.The summary, though, is that there are a number of companies that offer decent backup capabilities for GPS, although the performance and cost vary widely. NextNav came out furthest ahead according to the researchers, who stated that “All [Technology Readiness Level]-qualified vendors demonstrated at least some PNT performance of value, but only one vendor, NextNav, demonstrated in all applicable use case scenarios.”Beyond that, the DOT researchers said that “… none of the systems can universally backup the positioning and navigation capabilities provided by GPS and its augmentations.” Given the range of needs that GPS fulfills, they recommended that “a diverse universe of positioning and navigation technologies” be used to add resiliency in this infrastructure.Finally, costs remain quite complicated to determine. Given the way that different positioning systems operate, the fixed and variable costs for each system are highly dependent on desired coverage area and necessary transmitter density. The researchers weren’t able to devise a clear opinion on the cost effectiveness of different systems, although they do offer some initial data that can provide early insight.Given the importance of GPS and the desire for companies and the government to have reliable alternatives, VCs have dumped money on the PNT sector in recent years. Now, we have some hard data on which vendors are potentially picking up steam in terms of functionality and utility.NextNav raises $120M to deploy its indoor positioning tech to find people in skyscrapers']",Moss,"['DOT', 'NavigationClose', 'the Defense Department', 'Department of Transportation', 'NextNav', 'Hellen Systems', 'Crunchbase', 'DOT', 'PNT', 'PNT', 'NextNav', 'DOT', 'PNT', 'NextNav', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsGovernmentHardwarePolicygpsNextNavU.S. Department', 'the Defense Department', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/3RW4slUqLM,2021-01-15T18:11:25,Fired GitHub employee who warned co-workers about Nazis is seeking legal counsel,"['On the day a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, a worried GitHub employee warned his co-workers in the D.C. area to be safe. After making a comment in Slack saying, “stay safe homies, Nazis are about,” a fellow employee took offense, saying that type of rhetoric wasn’t good for work, the former employee told me. Two days later, he was fired, with a human relations representative citing a “pattern of behavior that is not conducive to company policy” as the rationale for his termination, he told me.In an interview with TechCrunch, the now-former employee said he was genuinely concerned about his co-workers in the area, in addition to his Jewish family members.\xa0TechCrunch agreed to keep the identity of the terminated employee confidential due to fears of his and his family’s safety.As Business Insider first reported, his firing led to employees circulating an internal letter asking GitHub to denounce white supremacy and Nazis. The employees also wanted answers about his firing. That led to GitHub CEO Nat Friedman telling employees the company would investigate the termination of the employee.Now, the terminated employee says he is currently seeking counsel to ensure his family is protected, as well as figure out if he can receive damages or some other form of reconciliation. The fired employee said GitHub has reached out to him for help in the internal investigation, but is waiting to engage with the company until he has legal representation in place.Still, he said he is not optimistic about the investigation.\xa0“I am 90% sure it’s not genuine,” the terminated employee said of Friedman’s response. “This type of stuff had been said before. It happened with the ICE stuff where the company said let’s have discussions but then if you mention ICE, you get fired. I used to believe in this company, but now I don’t.”Similar to what some employees are asking, the terminated employee sees this as an opportunity for GitHub to take a stance on white supremacy.He said, “I feel like this could be an opportunity for GitHub to really do a purge and say ‘Do we want white supremacists at this company and how do we get Black leaders into executive management?’ ”The latter is something he said he’s been asking for since he joined GitHub. But as he kept talking about the lack of diversity at the leadership level, he said he found his job at risk.“When I kept talking about it, I got threatened being fired in October,” he said. “Both my managers had to come completely to my defense and beg them not to fire me when I pointed out how the sales team maybe has just two people of color.”Update 1/16: The fired GitHubber has since clarified that he meant the sales leadership team, rather than the sales team as a whole.In a blanket statement to TechCrunch about the contents of this article, a GitHub spokesperson said:We take all complaints of this nature very seriously. We are actively investigating the situation.Upon his termination, the former employee said the company gave him two paychecks and sent him on his way. He said he would be open to some form of reconciliation, whether in the form of damages, healthcare coverage or something else. While he’s not looking for his job back, he says he would like to see more worker power at GitHub.\xa0“If I had a magic wand, I’d love for the employees at GitHub to be able to have a union and represent people from marginalized communities,” he said.

https://t.co/6EwbPrUxIG,2021-01-15T17:26:57,Bumble files to go public,"['The dating and networking service Bumble has\xa0filed to go public.The company, launched by a former co-founder of the IAC-owned Tinder, plans to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange, using the ticker symbol “BMBL.” Bumble’s planned IPO was first reported in December.Whitney Wolfe Herd doesn’t care what she’s supposed to doBumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd was on the founding team at Tinder before starting Bumble. She filed suit against Tinder for sexual harassment and discrimination, which was at least somewhat inspirational in her quest to build a dating app that put women in the driver’s seat.In 2019, Wolfe Herd took the helm of MagicLab, renamed to Bumble Group, in a $3 billion deal with Blackstone, replacing Badoo founder and CEO Andrey Andreev following a harassment scandal at the firm.The company is targeting the public markets at a particularly heady time for new offerings, with\xa0investors embracing venture-backed IPOs throughout late 2020 and the start of 2021. Previously privately held companies like Airbnb, Affirm and others have seen their fortunes soar on the back of prices that public investors are willing to pay, perhaps inducing more IPO filings than the market might have otherwise seen.You can read its IPO filing here. TechCrunch will have its usual tear-down of the document later today, but we have pulled some top-line numbers for you to kick off your own research.But before we do, the company’s board makeup, namely that it is over 70% women, is already drawing plaudits. Now, into its numbers.Inside Bumble’s IPO filingLet’s consider Bumble from three perspectives: Usage, financial results and ownership.On the usage front, Bumble is popular, as you would imagine a dating service would have to be to reach the scale required to go public. The company claims 42 million monthly active users (MAUs) as of Q3 2020 — many companies will try to get public on the strength of their third-quarter results from 2020, as it takes time to close Q4 and the full calendar year.Those 42 million MAUs translated into 2.4 million total paying users through the first nine months of 2020; the percent, then, of paying users to MAUs is not 2.4 million divided by 42, but a smaller fraction.Turning to the numbers, recall that Bumble sold a majority of itself a few years back. We bring that up as Bumble’s financial results are complicated thanks to its ownership structure.After the IPO, Bumble Inc. will “be a holding company, and its sole material asset will be a controlling equity interest in Bumble Holdings,” per the S-1 filing. So, how is Bumble Holdings doing?Medium? Doing the sums ourselves as the company’s S- 1 is fraught with accounting nuances, in the first nine months of 2019, Bumble managed the following:Revenues of $362.6 millionNet income of $68.6 millionAnd then, combining two columns to provide a similar set of results for the same period of 2020, Bumble recorded:Revenues of $416.6 millionNet income of -$116.7 millionFor those following along, we’re using the “Net (loss) earnings” line, for profitability, and not the “Net (loss) earnings attributable to owners / shareholders” as that would require even more explanation and we’re keeping it simple in this first look.While Bumble saw modest growth in 2020 through Q3 and a sharp swing to losses on a GAAP basis, the company’s adjusted profitability grew over the same time period. The company’s adjusted EBITDA, a very non-GAAP metric, expanded from $80.0 million in the first three quarters of 2019 to $108.3 million in the same period of 2020.A theory about the current IPO marketWhile we are generally willing to allow quickly growing companies some leniency when it comes to adjusted metrics, the gap between Bumble’s GAAP losses and its EBITDA results is a stress-test of our compassion. Bumble also swung from free cash flow positivity during the first nine months of 2019 to the first quarters of 2020.If you extrapolate Bumble’s Q1, Q2 and Q3 revenue to a full-year number, the company could manage $555.5 million in 2020 revenues. Even at a modest software-ish multiple, the company would be worth more than the $3 billion figure that we discussed before.However, its sharp unprofitability in 2020 could damper its eventual valuation. More as we dig more deeply into the filing.Finally, on the ownership question, the company’s filing is surprisingly denuded of data. Its principal shareholder section looks like this:When we know more, we’ll share more. Until then, happy S-1 reading.']",Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion,"['NavigationClose ScreenBumble', 'BumbleThe', 'IAC', 'Nasdaq', 'Wolfe Herd', 'MagicLab', 'Bumble Group', 'Blackstone', 'Badoo', 'Andrey Andreev', 'Affirm', 'Inside Bumble’s', 'Bumble Inc.', 'Bumble Holdings', 'EBITDA', 'Q3', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'IAC', 'Nasdaq', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

(disinformation). The documents are extremely hermetic, using niche biotech-technical language. No layperson is able to understand this. Perfect for conspiracy thinking, because it does have the numbers-percents. https://t.co/e0qfYoV3R0— Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) January 15, 2021Equally, it also seems possible that the high bar of expertise required to properly parse the data could limit how much damage the manipulated versions can do by limiting their viral appeal.But it’s notable the EMA has raised concerns over the risk to trust in coronavirus vaccines.“Two EU\xa0marketing authorisations for COVID-19 vaccines have been granted at the end of December/beginning of January following an independent scientific assessment,” the EMA writes in the latest update on the hack.“Amid the high infection rate in the EU, there is an urgent public health need to make vaccines available to EU citizens as soon as possible. Despite this urgency, there has always been consensus across the EU not to compromise the high-quality standards and to base any recommendation on the strength of the scientific evidence on a vaccine’s safety, quality and efficacy, and nothing else.“EMA is in constant dialogue with the EC, and other regulators across the network and internationally. Authorisations are granted when the evidence shows convincingly that the benefits of vaccination are greater than any risks of the vaccine. Full details of the scientific assessments are publicly available in the European Public Assessment Reports on EMA’s website,” it adds.At the time of writing, a criminal investigation into the cyberattack remains ongoing.The attack has not been attributed to a specific hacking group or state actor and there’s no confirmation of who is responsible for trying to sew coronavirus-related disinformation by seeding doctored medical documents online.However, last November Microsoft warned that hackers backed by Russia and North Korea had targeted pharmaceutical companies involved in the COVID-19 vaccine development efforts.Back in June, the European Commission also raised concerns about the risks of coronavirus vaccine disinformation spreading in the coming months — simultaneously name-checking China and Russia as foreign entities it said it had confirmed as being behind state-backed disinformation campaigns targeting the region.So suspicion seems likely to fall on the usual “hostile suspect” states.Tech giants must open up about the coronavirus ‘infodemic’, say EU lawmakersWe’ve seen similar “doctored leak” tactics attributed to Russia before — typically related to attempts to interfere with elections by smearing candidates for high political office.Researchers have suggested that the hackers responsible for the 2015-16 breaches of the Democratic National Committee’s network snuck doctored data into the leaked emails — an attack that was subsequently attributed to Russia.While, more recently, there was the infamous “Hunter Biden” laptop incident — which supporters of president Trump sought to leverage against his challenger for the White House (now president-elect) in last year’s presidential race.Suspect provenance of Hunter Biden data cache prompts skepticism and social media bansIn that case, any disinformation punch fizzled out amid a raft of dubious claims around the finding and timing of the claimed data cache (along with much greater general awareness about the risk of digital fake smear tactics in political campaigns in the wake of revelations about the scale of Russia’s social media influence disops in the 2016 U.S. presidential election).In an earlier incident, from 2017, emails linked to the French president Emmanuel Macron’s election campaign also leaked online shortly before the vote — coinciding with a document dump on an internet forum that suggested the presidential frontrunner had a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands. A claim Macron’s political movement said was fake.While in 2019 Reddit also linked to a suspected Russian political influence operation account activity involving the leak and amplification of sensitive U.K.-U.S. trade talks on its platform during the U.K. election campaign.It’s not clear whether that leaked trade dossier had been doctored or not (it was heavily redacted). And it certainly did not deliver a landslide election win to Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party — which used the leaked data in its campaign. But a similar, earlier operation which was also attributed to Russia had involved the leak of fake documents on multiple online platforms. (That disinformation operation was identified and taken down by Facebook in May 2019.)The emergence of leaks of doctored medical data linked to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments looks like a troubling evolution of hostile cyber disops which seek to weaponize false data to generate unhelpful outcomes for others — as there’s a direct risk to public health if trust in vaccine programs are undermined.There have been state-level hacks targeting medical data before too — albeit without the pandemic-related backdrop of an ongoing public health emergency.Back in 2016, for example, the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed that confidential medical data related to the Olympic drug tests of a number of athletes had been leaked by the Russia-linked cyber hacking group, ‘Fancy Bear”. In that case there were no reports of the data being doctored.Microsoft says hackers backed by Russia and North Korea targeted COVID-19 vaccine makers']",drawing TechCrunch’s attention,"['EMA', 'NavigationClose', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Dogukan Keskinkilic', 'Getty ImagesThe European Medicines Agency', 'EMA', 'Lukasz Olejnik', '@lukOlejnik', 'EMA', 'EMA', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EC', 'the European Public Assessment Reports', 'EMA’s', 'Microsoft', 'the European Commission', 'EU', 'the Democratic National Committee’s', 'Trump', 'the White House', 'Hunter Biden', 'Emmanuel Macron’s', 'Macron’s', 'Jeremy Corbyn’s', 'Labour Party', 'the World Anti-Doping Agency', 'Microsoft', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'European Medicines Agency', 'EMA', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/e8onNXOJPY,2021-01-15T16:39:21,Uber planning to spin out Postmates’ delivery robot arm,"['Another Uber spinout is in the works.Postmates X, the robotics division of the on-demand delivery startup that Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion, is seeking investors in its bid to become a separate company, according to several people familiar with the plans.The startup is being referred to as Serve Robotics, a nod to the yellow and black-emblazoned autonomous sidewalk delivery bot that was developed and piloted by Postmates X. The Serve robot, which recently partnered with Pink Dot Stores for deliveries in West Hollywood, will likely be the centerpiece of the new startup.Uber officially completes Postmates acquisitionUber declined to comment.Under the deal, which is being shopped to investors, the company would be run by Ali Kashani, who heads up Postmates X and leads the Serve program. Anthony Armenta would lead the startup’s software efforts and Aaron Leiba would be in charge of hardware — keeping the same positions they hold at Postmates X.Uber would retain an ownership stake in Serve Robotics and maintain a commercial agreement with the startup. Serve would get the IP and assets in exchange. Uber is in discussions to retain about a 25% stake in the new startup, according to one source familiar with the deal.There is not a legal entity — as of yet — named Serve Robotics. However, a website domain serverobotics.com was registered January 6.Uber’s path to profitsThe spinoff would be in line with Uber’s streamlined business strategy that began to take shape after its public market debut in May 2019 and accelerated last year as the COVID-19 pandemic put pressure on the ride-hailing company. Two years ago, Uber had enterprises across the transportation landscape, from ride-hailing and micromobility to logistics, public transit, food delivery and futuristic bets like autonomous vehicles and air taxis. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has dismantled the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach as he pushes the company toward profitability.In 2020, Uber offloaded shared scooter and bike unit Jump in a complex deal with Lime, sold a stake worth $500 million in its logistics spinoff Uber Freight and rid itself of its autonomous vehicle unit Uber ATG and its air taxi play Uber Elevate.Aurora acquired Uber ATG in a deal that had a similar structure to the Jump-Lime transaction. Aurora didn’t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company.In a similarly crafted deal, Uber Elevate was sold to Joby Aviation in December.Uber sells air taxi business Elevate to Joby Aviation, shedding its last moonshotDelivery remained the one area in which Uber has invested. The company, seeing an opportunity as demand skyrocketed for its Uber Eats delivery service, started looking for an acquisition to strengthen its position. Uber tried and failed to buy Grubhub, losing out to European heavyweight Just Eat Takeaway.Uber landed on Postmates and in July 2020 agreed to buy the delivery startup in an all-stock deal valued at $2.65 billion. The deal closed in December.Serve, the friendly robotPostmates’ exploration into sidewalk delivery bots began in earnest in 2017 after the company quietly acquired Kashani’s startup Lox Inc. As head of Postmates X, the company’s R&D arm, Kashani set out to answer the question: why move two-pound burritos with two-ton cars?Postmates revealed its first Serve autonomous delivery bot in December 2018. A second generation — with an identical design but different lidar sensors and few other upgrades — emerged in summer 2019 ahead of its planned commercial launch in Los Angeles.Instead of working with a partner, Postmates used its own delivery data to form the foundation of how it would design and deploy a sidewalk bot, according to comments Kashani made during a TC Sessions: Mobility 2020 event in October.“When you look at the data and see that over half of deliveries are within a short distance it becomes a no brainer — these robots can actually complete them,” Kashani said at the time, in reference to the application of autonomous delivery bots for delivery.The Postmates X used historical delivery data from the company to develop a simulation, which was then used in the design of the Serve bot. It helped the team determine what battery life would be needed and the size of the cargo hold, among other features.The bot only represented a sliver of Postmates’ delivery business. However, the company has seen an increased interest in the bot in Los Angeles and San Francisco — the two cities where it commercially operates — as COVID-19 fueled demand for contactless delivery.Kashani noted back in October that the bots had completed thousands of deliveries in Los Angeles and was preparing to expand into the city’s West Hollywood enclave. That expansion launched late last year with a twist.

In fact, one of the issues I’ve raised the last couple of times is the fact that Samsung didn’t offer its own equivalent to products like the AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM3 (though that latter reference is starting to become a bit dated).It’s a hole in the lineup now filled by the Galaxy Buds Pro, which slot in the high end, above the Galaxy Buds Live and Galaxy Buds+. The naming conventions could be streamlined a bit, but it’s a small complaint in the grand scheme. At $199, the Pros are $30 more than the Live and $50 more than the Pluses. More importantly, it puts them at $50 less than the AirPods Pro – their clearest analogue.Image Credits: Brian HeaterAnd like Apple’s Pro buds, the Galaxy Buds are very specifically designed to operate with Samsung’s devices. You can still pair them with other Android handsets, but you’re going to lose key parts of the software integration. This honestly seems to be the way things are headed, with practically every smartphone company also manufacturing their own headphones. And certainly Samsung’s got enough market share that such a play makes sense.If you do want to use them on another Android device, you can pair them by downloading the Galaxy Wearables app. You can pair them manually without the app, but you’ll lose a bunch more features in the process. Like past Galaxy Buds models, there’s no physical button on the case for pairing.After several generations of devices, Samsung’s certainly got the foundation in place. And its purchase of Harman/AKG in 2017 has clearly played a key role in its ability to create some quality audio accessories. All of that comes into play here. Samsung’s made some solid choices on the design front. The charging case is remarkably compact. I was actually a bit surprised when I opened the package. It’s not nearly as long as the AirPods case, though it is a bit thicker. In any case, it’s certainly compact enough to carry around, unlike, say the Powerbeats Pro.The battery claims are pretty impressive, given the size. The company rates the buds at five hours each and 28 hours with the case. Turn off active noise canceling and Bixby (I’ll let you guess which of those two I won’t miss) and the numbers bump up to eight and 20 hours, respectively. I will say that I was able to confidently bring the headphones with me on one of my lengthy morning sabbaticals without worrying about packing the case. That’s not something I can say about every wireless earbud.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe headphones sport an 11-millimeter woofer and 6.5-millimeter tweeter. I found the sound to be an overall good mix, whether listening to music or a podcast. If you’re so included, you can also fiddle with the equalizer in the wearable app. It features six presets, rather than sliders, so it’s an imperfect science. But I didn’t really feel the need to mess around in there much.The active noise canceling is solid, as well (okay, I admit it, Bixby is the one I’d drop in a heartbeat). I wasn’t really aware at how good a job it was doing drowning out street noise until I switched it off — this can be accomplished with a long press on the side touch panel or through the app. By default the former switches between ANC and transparent mode, skipping the off mode in the middle. Like the equalizer, you an adjust the level of ANC here — either high or low.If you’re a Samsung true believer, Seamless Switch can be enabled, allowing you to, say, switch between a tablet and a phone when a call comes in. Other neat Samsung-specific features include the ability to use the buds as a kind of makeshift lavalier mic while recording video on the Galaxy S21. The SmartThings app can also be used to find misplaced buds. All in all, Samsung is clearly building up its ecosystem here.Image Credits: Brian HeaterThe design of the buds themselves has been streamlined since the extremely bean-like Buds Live. The company says they were designed to minimize contact with the ear, to help relieve pressure. It’s a shame that everyone isn’t able to try every earbud on before buying — how they fit in your own ears is obviously an extremely personal thing.I found, however, that one of my ears tends to ache when wearing them for a prolonged period — not an issue I’ve had with either the AirPods Pro or Pixel Buds (the Powerbeats Pro are also great in this respect). I found myself fiddling with them semi-regularly and triggering the touch mechanism in the process (this can be turned off by default in the app).Most of my issues with the Buds Pro are pretty minor. They’re a worthy update to the line and a great pair of headphones if you’re a Samsung user.']",$175 million Series D,"['Samsung’s', 'Samsung devicesBrian Heater@bheater', 'Brian', 'Samsung’s', 'Samsung', 'Sony', 'Pros', 'Brian HeaterAnd', 'Apple’s Pro', 'Samsung’s', 'Android', 'Samsung’s', 'Android', 'Samsung’s', 'Samsung’s', 'Bixby', 'Brian HeaterThe', 'Bixby', 'ANC', 'ANC', 'Samsung', 'Seamless Switch', 'Samsung', 'SmartThings', 'Samsung', 'Brian HeaterThe', 'Samsung', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'ArticleSamsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro', 'Brian Heater5:00 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

After all, how big could the OKR software market really be?It’s a subniche of corporate planning tools! In a world where every company already pays for Google or Microsoft’s productivity suite, and some big software companies offer similar planning support, how substantial could demand prove for pure-play OKR startups?The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.Pretty substantial, we’re finding out. After OKR-focused Gtmhub announced its $30 million Series B the other day, The Exchange reached out to a number of OKR-focused startups we’ve previously covered and asked about their 2020 growth.Gtmhub had released new growth metrics along with its funding news, plus we had historical growth data from some other players in the space. So let’s peek at new and historical numbers from Gthmhub, Perdoo, WorkBoard, Ally.io, Koan\xa0and WeekDone.Growth (and some caveats)A startup growing 400% in a year from a $50,000 ARR base is not\xa0impressive. It would be much more impressive to grow 200% from $1 million ARR, or 150% from $5 million.So, percentage growth is only so good, as metrics go. But it’s also one that private companies are more likely to share than hard numbers, as the market has taught startups that sharing real data is akin to drowning themselves. Alas.As we view the following, bear in mind that a simply higher percentage growth number does not indicate that a company added more net ARR than another; it could be growing faster from a smaller base. And some companies in the mix did not share ARR growth, but instead disclosed other bits of data. We got what we could.Gtmhub:400% ARR growth, 2019.300% ARR growth, 2020.More: The company has seen strong ACV growth and its reportedly strong gross margins from 2019 held up in 2020, it said.TechCrunch coveragePerdoo:240% paid customer growth, 2020.340% user base growth, 2020.Given strong market demand, a company representative told The Exchange that Perdoo had to restrict its free tier to 10 users.TechCrunch coverageWorkBoard:']",Crossbeam,"['OKR', 'OKR', 'Nigel Sussman', 'OKR', 'OKR', 'Google', 'Microsoft’s', 'OKR startups?The Exchange', 'Exchange', 'Exchange', 'OKR', '’ve', 'Gtmhub', 'Koan', 'WeekDone', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'ARR', 'TechCrunch coveragePerdoo:240%', 'The Exchange', 'Perdoo', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEnterpriseFundings & ExitsStartupsTCThe ExchangeWeekdoneworkboardMarket Analysisextra-crunch-', 'OKR', 'Alex Wilhelm4:25 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Spending saw big increases pretty much across the board in 2020 as a homebound populace sought comfort and distraction in gaming. This comes in stark contrast to much of the rest of the consumer electronics space, in which economic uncertainty curtailed purchasing on non-essentials.According to the latest figures from NPD, spending on gaming hardware, software and accessories was up 25% in December and 27% for the full year. Hardware specifically increased 38% year-over-year for December to $1.35 billion, with the arrival of next-gen consoles from Sony and Microsoft.Dec 2020 US NPD THREAD – December 2020 consumer spending across video game hardware, content and accessories reached a December record $7.7B, 25% higher when compared to a year ago.

In spite of this year’s new arrivals (which were hampered by limited availability), Nintendo’s Switch once again dominated sales for the month, with the PS5 grabbing the No. 2 spot. The Switch’s 2020 was the second-highest annual performance for a console, after the Wii in 2008.The Switch — which turns three this March — got off to a slow start, courtesy of its own limited availability. But the arrival of a new Animal Crossing title helped rocket it to the top, as isolated consumers looked for new venues for social gaming.

https://t.co/bZJyqqaerz,2021-01-15T15:01:16,Crossbeam raises $25M to back startups built on ‘platform economies’,"['While many venture capitalists might hope to fund the next Amazon or Shopify, Crossbeam is a new firm focused on backing the startups built on top of these platforms. And it recently closed its $25 million first fund.We’ve written about well-funded startups like SellerX, Perch and Heroes that acquire and grow Amazon businesses, and Crossbeam General Partner Ali Hamed similarly pointed to Amazon to illustrate the scale of the opportunity. Noting that third-party sales on Amazon reached $200 billion in 2019, Hamed said, “There’s going to be 100 winners in this space.”He added that the firm isn’t just focused on Amazon — he also cited Thumbtack, Spotify and Shopify as “platform economies” where Crossbeam could invest, and he elaborated on this point in a Medium post published last fall:Rather than own FB shares, we’d rather own Instagram accounts. Rather than owning Amazon stock, we’d rather own a bunch of third-party selling merchants. And rather than owning Google stock, we’d rather own YouTube libraries.Why? Because all the tailwinds that make those stocks interesting to own are, in part, shared by the commercial actors on their platforms. And yet capital markets largely haven’t flowed into those spaces yet. Many traditional funds are not set up to finance these platform constituents. On top of that, many of the economic ecosystems on these platforms are newly mature, and so there are not pre-existing models to figure out how to value each asset.CoVenture Raises $3M To Build Software For StartupsHamed and General Partner Savneet Singh are also partners at CoVenture, a firm that originally took equity in exchange for technical services, but is now more focused on providing debt to startups. He described Crossbeam as a joint venture between CoVenture, Moelis Asset Management and Fenway Summer, with CoVenture offering additional debt funding to Crossbeam’s equity investments when it makes sense.When asked about the risk to startups of trying to build businesses on a single platform, Hamed said that in some cases, it may make sense to build an audience on one platform and then expand and diversify — but it will depend on the platform. The key question, he argued, is, “Does the platform make money for you, on your behalf?”“If you expand into other platforms, some ‘help you earn money’ and some don’t,” Hamed added via email. “YouTube does, because it seeks ad revenue on your behalf, and splits the ad revenue with you. On Instagram, they don’t (Insta doesn’t share ad rev with creators except in very rare cases) … so the ‘awesomeness’ of each platform very much depends on that.”Even before closing its first fund, Crossbeam has made six investments, including digital media company Wave.tv, litigation financing company Litty, on-demand poof-of-service startup Proof and Acquco, which acquires third-party Amazon sellers.SellerX raises $118M to buy up and grow Amazon marketplace businesses']","Alexa can now pay for gas at over 11,500 Exxon and Mobil stations in the US","['NavigationClose ScreenCrossbeam', 'Getty ImagesWhile', 'Amazon', 'Shopify, Crossbeam', 'Amazon', 'Crossbeam General', 'Ali Hamed', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Spotify and Shopify', 'Amazon', 'YouTube', 'StartupsHamed', 'Savneet Singh', 'CoVenture', 'CoVenture', 'Moelis Asset Management', 'Fenway Summer', 'YouTube', 'Instagram', 'Insta', 'Wave.tv', 'Litty', 'Proof', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CapitalAli HamedAmazonCoVentureCrossbeamheroesShopifySpotifyWaveCrossbeam', 'Amazon', 'Shopify, Crossbeam', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/2dLBBjdqNb,2021-01-15T14:12:26,Want a job in tech? Flockjay pitches its sales training service as an on-ramp to tech careers,"['“Most people don’t even know that a job in tech sales is even a possibility,” says Shaan Hathiramani, the founder and chief executive of Flockjay, a company offering a tech sales training curriculum to the masses.Hathiramani sees his startup as an on-ramp to the tech industry for legions of workers who have the skillsets to work in tech, but lack the network to see themselves in the business. Just like coding bootcamps have enabled thousands to get jobs as programmers in the tech business, Flockjay can get into the industry talented people who had never considered a job in tech.The company — which had previously raised $3 million from investors, including Serena Williams and Will Smith, along with tech industry luminaries like Microsoft chairman John Thompson, Airtable head of sales Liat Bycel, Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit, and former Netflix CPO Tom Willerer — has just raised new capital to expand its business in a time when accelerated on-ramps to new jobs have never been more important.A former financier with the multibillion-dollar investment firm Citadel, Hathiramani sees Flockjay, and the business of tech sales, as a way for a number of people to transform their lives.“We provide a premier sales academy,” Hathiramani said. “It costs zero dollars if you take the course and don’t get a job and costs 10% of your income for the first year if you do get a job. That nets out to 6 or 7K.”A few hundred students have gone through the program so far, Hathiramani said, and the goal is to train 1,000 people over the course of 2021. The average income of a student before they go through Flockjay’s training program is $30,000 to $35,000 typically, Hathiramani said.Upon graduation, those students can expect to make between $75,000 and $85,000, he said.Increasing access among those students who have not necessarily been exposed to the tech world is critical for what Hathiramani wants to do with his sales bootcamp.Flockjay founder Shaan Hathiramani. Image Credit: FlockjayThe entrepreneur said roughly 40% of students don’t have a four-year college degree; half of the students identify as female or non-binary, and half of the company’s students identify as Black or Hispanic. About 80% of the company’s students find a job within the first six months of graduation.These are students like Elise Cox, a former Bojangles’ manager and Flockjay graduate, who moved from Georgia to Denver to be a sales tech representative for Gusto. She tripled her salary from $13 an hour in the food service industry to a salaried position with wages and benefits.“I enjoy being able to generate revenue for the company,” Cox, a 41-year-old grandmother, whose five-year plans include a sales leadership role, told Fast Company two years ago. “The revenue is the lifeblood of the company and being part of the team gives me sense of fulfillment.”Partnerships with Opportunity@Work, Hidden Genius Project, Peninsula Bridge and TechHire Oakland help to ensure a diverse pool of applicants and a more diverse workforce for the tech industry — where diversity is still a huge problem.As Hathiramani looks to take his company from training a couple of hundred students to over a thousand, the founder has raised new cash from previous investors, including Lightspeed, Coatue and Y Combinator, and new investors like eVentures, Salesforce Ventures, the Impact America Fund, Cleo Capital and Gabrielle Union.For the New Jersey-born entrepreneur, Flockjay was a way to give back to a community that he knew intimately. After his family settled in New Jersey after immigrating to the United States, Hathiramani went first to Horace Mann on a scholarship and then attended Harvard before getting his job at Citadel.Even while he was working at the pinnacle of the financial services world he started nonprofits like the Big Shoulders Fund and taught financial literacy.After a while, he moved to the Bay Area to begin plotting a way to merge his twin interests in education and financial inclusion.“That led to me spending a year helping startups for free and trying to understand their problems with hiring and training” said Hathiramani. “It helped me surface this economic waste in plain sight. There were all these people talking to customers and they were spending three months on the job learning the job and they didn’t want to do the job or they weren’t very good at it.”Tech salesforces were a point of entry in the system that almost anyone could access, if they could get in through the door, Hathiramani said. Flockjay wants to be the key to opening the door.So, the company now has $11 million in new funding to bring its sales training bootcamp to a larger audience. Hathiramani also wants to make the bootcamp model more of a community with continuous development after a student completes the program. “I view education as a membership and not a transaction,” he said. “We focus on continuous learning and continuous up-skilling.”Part of that is the flywheel of building up networks in a manner similar to Y Combinator, the accelerator program from which Flockjay graduated in 2019.“We went through YC to learn… how they manufacture the privilege in the world that they have afforded,” said Hathiramani. “How do you take some of that and provide it to someone who is starting their careers in tech. You get better at your job the more connections you have. As we accelerate the alumni piece… they can draw on other alums that they’re selling into.”The top 10 startups from Y Combinator W19 Demo Day 1']",OneWeb,"['NavigationClose', 'Shaan Hathiramani', 'Flockjay', 'Hathiramani', 'Serena Williams', 'Will Smith', 'Microsoft', 'John Thompson', 'Liat Bycel', 'Gmail', 'Paul Buchheit', 'Tom Willerer', 'Citadel', 'Hathiramani', 'Hathiramani', 'Flockjay', 'Hathiramani', 'Hathiramani', 'Shaan Hathiramani', 'Black', 'Elise Cox', 'Flockjay', 'Fast Company', 'Hidden Genius Project', 'TechHire Oakland', 'Hathiramani', 'Lightspeed', 'Coatue', 'eVentures', 'Salesforce Ventures', 'the Impact America Fund', 'Cleo Capital', 'Gabrielle Union', 'Flockjay', 'Hathiramani', 'Horace Mann', 'Harvard', 'the Big Shoulders Fund', 'Hathiramani', 'Hathiramani', 'Hathiramani', 'Flockjay', 'Hathiramani', 'Y Combinator W19 Demo Day', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'Shaan Hathiramani', 'Flockjay', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

These new models would come in both 14-inch and 16-inch sizes, with new and improved Apple Silicon processors like those that Apple debuted on the new MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro model late last year. They would also see the return of Apple’s MagSafe charger, a magnetic dedicated charging port that would replace USB-C for power, and they could potentially do away with the Touch Bar, the small strip of OLED display built in to the keyboard on modern MacBook Pros.Bloomberg’s report suggests that these MacBook Pro models will have processors with more cores and better graphics capabilities than the existing M1 chips that power Apple’s current notebooks with in-house silicon, and that they’ll also have displays with brighter panels that offer higher contrast. Physically, they’ll resemble existing notebooks, according to the report’s sources, but they’ll see the return of MagSafe, the dedicated magnetic charging interface that Apple used prior to switching power delivery over to USB-C on its laptops.MagSafe had the advantage of easily disconnecting in case of anyone accidentally tripping across the power cord while plugged in, without yanking the computer with it. It also meant that it kept all data ports free for accessories. Bloomberg says that the revitalized MagSafe for new notebooks will also offer faster charging versus USB-C, in addition to those other benefits.As for the Touch Bar, it has been a topic of debate since its introduction. Pro users in particular seem to dislike the interface option, especially because it replaces a row of dedicated physical keys that could be useful in professional workflows. The report claims that Apple has “tested versions that remove the Touch Bar,” so it seems less clear that Apple will finally unring that particular bell, but I personally know a lot of people who would be excited if that does come to pass.Finally, Bloomberg says Apple is also planning a new redesigned MacBook Air. That was updated most recently just a couple of months ago, and the report says it’ll only follow “long after” these new MacBook Pros, so it seems unlikely to arrive in 2021.MacBook Pro 16” first impressions: Return of the Mack']",OneWeb,"['Apple', 'MacBook Pros', 'MagSafe', 'Apple', 'NavigationClose', 'MacBook Pros', 'MagSafe', 'Apple processorsDarrell Etherington@etherington /', 'AppleApple', 'Apple Silicon', 'Apple', 'MacBook Air', 'MacBook Pro', 'Apple’s MagSafe', 'the Touch Bar', 'MacBook Pros', 'MacBook Pro', 'Apple', 'MagSafe', 'Apple', 'MagSafe', 'Bloomberg', 'the Touch Bar', 'Apple', 'the Touch Bar', 'Apple', 'Bloomberg', 'Apple', 'MacBook Air', 'MacBook Pros', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'MacBook Pros', 'MagSafe', 'Apple', 'Etherington3:12', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Theoretically, this means an automaker could choose to use the custom assistant to interact with drivers on specific products and services tied to the vehicle as well as integrate the Alexa voice assistant for other needs. For instance, if a driver asks Alexa to roll down a car window, the request will be routed to the brand’s assistant, Amazon explained. If a customer asks the brand’s assistant to play an audio book, the request will be routed to Alexa.Yes, that means your next car could have two Alexas.Here’s a video showing how it works.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will be the first Alexa Custom Assistant customer. An FCA-branded intelligent assistant is being built for integration in select vehicle models, according to Amazon.Amazon’s pitch isn’t just to automakers, however. The e-commerce giant said it can be used to build intelligent assistants into mobile applications, smart properties, video games and consumer electronics. The Alexa Custom Assistant is based on the Alexa technology stack. The custom wake words are created with the same process used for developing the Alexa wake word. Amazon will give companies access to Alexa’s voice science experts to help guide them through the recording process and develop the voice using advanced machine learning algorithms. Developers also have access to Alexa’s pre-built capabilities such as communications, local search, traffic and navigation to further accelerate time to market.The aim of this new product, Amazon says, is to give companies an efficient and cost-effective way of delivering an intelligent assistant to its customers. The path of building an intelligent AI-based assistant is complex, typically involves long development cycles and requires resources to build it from scratch and maintain over time, Amazon argues.Of course, it’s also another way to ensure Alexa is in more devices, even if it goes by another name.Alexa can now pay for gas at over 11,500 Exxon and Mobil stations in the US']",blog post,"['Amazon’s', 'Alexa', 'NavigationClose', 'Alexa', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'NurPhoto / Getty ImagesAmazon', 'Alexa', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobiles', 'Alexa Custom Assistant', 'Alexa', 'Alexa', 'Alexa', 'Amazon', 'Alexa', 'Alexas', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobiles', 'FCA', 'Amazon', 'Amazon’s', 'Alexa', 'Alexa', 'Amazon', 'Alexa', 'Alexa', 'Amazon', 'AI', 'Amazon', 'Alexa', 'Alexa', 'Exxon', 'Mobil', 'USclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Chrysler AutomobilesAmazon’s', 'Alexa', 'Korosec2:03', 'Alexa', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobiles', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

This means there are still more than 500 left to launch in the first generation. The company is continuing to whittle down its ambitions. Earlier this week, OneWeb announced that it had “streamlined its constellation” and as a result was reducing the request it was making to the U.S. regulators for licenses. Originally OneWeb had applied to the FCC for market access for 47,884 satellites; now the figure is down to 6,372.SoftBank Group Corp. and Hughes Network Systems are providing the financing, the company said. The news comes about a month after OneWeb launched 36 satellites, its third launch to put more of its fleet into orbit. At the time, its executive chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said that it was on track to raise $400 million — so this represents a more-than threefold increase on that amount. This appears to confirm that.“OneWeb’s mission is to connect everyone, everywhere. We have made rapid progress to re-start the business since emerging from Chapter 11 in November,” said Neil Masterson, CEO of OneWeb, in a statement. “We welcome the investments by SoftBank and Hughes as further proof of progress towards delivering our goal.”A spokesperson for the company has confirmed to me that the company is not disclosing its valuation. Adding in this round, it looks like the company has raised around $4.5 billion to date, although the bankruptcy meant a significant recapitalization and revaluation of the business and that figure includes funding from before it was restructured.SoftBank and Hughes are both past backers and partners in OneWeb, so this is something of an insurance policy to make sure that its previous investment doesn’t go completely to waste. (At least some of it has already been written down: SoftBank years ago posted an eye-watering loss of $24 billion due in part to that OneWeb bet.)SoftBank expects $24 billion in losses from Vision Fund, WeWork and OneWeb investmentsHughes, meanwhile, invests via its parent company EchoStar and inked a deal with the company way back in 2017 to build the terrestrial infrastructure that would work with OneWeb’s satellites. Deals, building and rollouts in the world of satellite technology play out over a number of years, and often face delays, so being three years out — or even more — on seeing any fruits from that deal is not hugely surprising.OneWeb acknowledged the long-time connection between the investors and confirmed that the ground network is still being built by Hughes.“We are delighted to welcome the investment from SoftBank and Hughes. Both are deeply familiar with our business, share our vision for the future, and their commitment allows us to capitalise on the significant growth opportunity ahead for OneWeb,” said Mittal in a statement. “We gain from their experience and capabilities, as we deliver a unique LEO network for the world.”Originally, Hughes had planned for the first services to start running in 2019 — although that was when OneWeb and its fleet of LEO (low Earth orbit) satellites was still a very shiny idea, backed by $1.7 billion in venture funding.The company’s original idea was always great but (no pun intended) also something of a moonshot: LEO satellites have already been proven to be a strong and useful complement to terrestrial networks for providing broadband connectivity to more remote areas that couldn’t be reached in other ways. The idea with OneWeb was to make that service something useful and used by a much bigger group of on-the-ground users, with the promise being 400Mbps for everyone.While broadband usage has certainly exploded in the interim, what OneWeb perhaps didn’t bank on was that those building non-satellite systems for providing connectivity would also be progressing in their network advances; nor how long it might take, or the financing needed, to get its fleet off the ground on the timelines it was promising.These days, OneWeb says that growing ubiquity of 5G, Internet of Things and connectivity needs overall still present a strong use case for its approach — which it says “includes a network of global gateway stations and a range of user terminals for different customer markets capable of delivering affordable, fast, high-bandwidth and low-latency communications services.” Secretary of State, BEIS, The Rt. Hon. Kwasi Kwarteng, said in a statement: “Our investment in OneWeb is part of our continued commitment to the UK’s space sector, putting Britain at the forefront of the latest technological advances.

https://t.co/BDYvIfbsqL,2021-01-15T11:35:08,How Twitter is handling the 2021 US presidential transition,"['Twitter has set out its plans for US Inauguration Day 2021, next Wednesday, January 20, when president-elect Joe Biden will be sworn into office as the 46th US president and vice president-elect Kamala Harris will become VP.“This year, multiple challenging circumstances will require that most people experience this historic ceremony virtually,” the social media firm writes in a blog post detailing how it will handle the transition of power on its platform as the Trump administration departs office.“As Twitter will serve as both a venue for people to watch and talk about this political event, and play a key role in facilitating the transfer of official government communication channels, we want to be transparent and clear about what people should expect to see on the platform.”The inauguration will of course be livestreamed via Twitter by multiple accounts (such as news outlets), as well as the official inauguration accounts, @JCCIC\xa0and\xa0@BidenInaugural.Twitter will also be streaming the ceremony via its US Elections Hub, where it says it will share curated Moments, Lists and accounts to follow as well.Once sworn into office, Biden and Harris will gain control of the @POTUS and @VP Twitter accounts. Other accounts that will transition to the new administration on the day include @WhiteHouse, @FLOTUS and @PressSec.Twitter has also confirmed that Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, will use a new official account — called @SecondGentleman. (It’s not clear why not ‘SGOTUS’; aside from, well, the unloveliness of the acronym. Update: A Twitter spokesman told us the ‘@SecondGentleman’ account “was the preference”.)\xa0Twitter permanently bans President TrumpAs it did when president Obama left office, Twitter will transfer the current institutional accounts of the Trump administration to the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara) — meaning the outgoing administration’s tweets and account history will remain publicly available (with account usernames updated to reflect their archived status, e.g. @POTUS will be archived as @POTUS45).However Trump’s personal account, which he frequently used as a political cudgel, yelling in ALL CAPS and/or spewing his customary self-pitying tweets, has already been wiped from public view after Twitter took the decision to permanently ban him last week for repeat violations of its rules of conduct. So there’s likely to be a major gap in Nara’s Trump archive.“This archiving and transfer process only occurs for official government Twitter accounts,” Twitter confirmed.Since late last year we’ve known the transitioning @POTUS and institutional accounts will not automatically retain followers from the prior administration. But Twitter still hasn’t confirmed why.Today it just reiterated that the current (33.3M) followers of @POTUS and the other official accounts will receive a notification about the archival process which will include the “option” to follow the new holders of the accounts.That’s another notable change from 2017 when Trump inherited the ~14M followers of president Obama’s @POTUS. Biden will instead have to start his presidential tweeting from scratch.“We’re not commenting on follower transfer beyond what’s in this blog,” Twitter’s spokesperson added when we asked about this.Given the chaotic events in the US capital last week, when supporters of the outgoing president broke through police lines to cause mayhem on the hill and in the House, there’s every reason for tech platforms to approach the 2021 transition with trepidation, lest their tools get used to livestream another historic insurrection (or worse).Since then Trump has also continued to maintain his false claim that the election was stolen through voter fraud.Although he avoided any new direct reference to this big lie when he circumvented Twitter’s ban on his personal account earlier this week, by posting a new video of himself speaking on the official @WhiteHouse account.In the video he decried the “incursion at the US capital”, as he put it; claimed that he “unequivocally condemns the violence that we saw last week”; and called for unity. But Twitter has put tight limits on what Trump can say on its platform without having his posts removed (as well limiting him to the official @POTUS channel). So he remains on a very tight speech leash.Why Twitter says it banned President TrumpIn the video Trump limits his verbal attacks to a few remarks — about what he describes as “the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days” — dubbing tech platforms’ censorship “wrong” and “dangerous”, and adding that “what is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another”.There’s a lot going on here but it should not escape notice that Trump’s seeming contrition and quasi-concession and his very-last-minute calls for unity have only come when he actively feels power draining away from him.Most notably, his call for unity has only come after powerful tech platforms acted to shut off his hate-megaphone — ending the years of special dispensation they granted Trump to ride roughshod over democratic convention and tear up the civic rulebook. It’s very interesting to speculate how different the 2021 US inauguration might look and feel if platforms like Twitter had consistently enforced their rules against Trump from the get-go. Instead we’re stuck in all sorts of lockdown, counting the days til Biden takes office — and above all hoping for a smooth transition of power.So Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is quite right when he said this week that Twitter has failed in its mission to “promote healthy conversation”. His company ignored warnings about online toxicity for years. Trump is, in no small part, the divisive product of that.\xa0That said, having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications. While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us.— jack (@jack) January 14, 2021In a brief section of Twitter’s transition handling blog post, entitled “protecting the public conversation”, the company refers back to a post from earlier this week where it set out steps it’s taking to try to prevent its platform from being used to “incite violence, organize attacks, and share deliberately misleading information about the election outcome” in the coming days.These measures include permanently suspending ~70,000 accounts it said were primarily dedicated to sharing content related to the QAnon conspiracy theory; aggressively beefing up its civic integrity policy; and applying interaction limits on labeled tweets plus blocking violative keywords from appearing in Trends and search.“These efforts, including our open lines of communication with law enforcement, will continue through the inauguration and will adapt as needed if circumstances change in real-time,” it adds, preparing for the possibility of more unrest.Europe seizes on social media’s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulationThis report was updated with additional comment from Twitter']",from the company’s above-range IPO price of $42,"['NavigationClose', 'Lomas@riptari /', 'Patrick T.

https://t.co/TZK6J5gef7,2021-01-14T15:59:48,WhatsApp faces legal challenge over privacy in its biggest market,"['WhatsApp is facing a legal challenge in India, its biggest market, after a petition was filed Thursday before Delhi High Court over the upcoming change in the Facebook-owned app’s data-sharing policy.The petition alleges the new terms that WhatsApp requires its roughly 450 million users in the country to accept is a violation of their fundamental rights to privacy and poses a threat to national security.Through an in-app alert, WhatsApp has asked users in recent days to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share with Facebook some personal data about them, such as their phone number and location.Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said. The change has been mischaracterized by many as their personal communication being compromised, which WhatsApp clarified this week was not the case.The Facebook-owned service, which serves over 2 billion users worldwide, said private conversations between people remain just as private as before. Facebook has also bought front-page newspaper ads in several leading Indian dailies this week to explain the change, which it first outlined last year.The petitioner said the new terms grant WhatsApp a “360-degree profile into a person’s online activity” without any “government oversight.”“WhatsApp has made a mockery out of our fundamental right to privacy while discharging a public function in India, besides jeopardizing the National Security of the country by sharing, transmitting and storing the users data in some [other] country and that data, in turn, will be governed by the laws of that foreign country,” the petition, which is expected to be heard Friday, reads.Several high-profile startup founders and executives in India have also criticized WhatsApp’s new data-sharing policy. Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and chief executive of India’s most valuable startup Paytm, accused WhatsApp of operating with double standards, pointing to how the new change was not affecting the app’s users in Europe.How long we will be taken for granted by such blatant double standards ?Self claimed ad claiming respect of our privacy v/s   actual policy.For India                 For Europe  pic.twitter.com/bT45XwvsO1— Vijay Shekhar Sharma (@vijayshekhar) January 13, 2021The outrage over the new change has resulted in tens of millions of users exploring other communication apps such as Signal and Telegram in recent days.

https://t.co/xXMrP84omN,2021-01-15T05:24:04,Trump administration adds Xiaomi to military blacklist,"['Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is the latest to be added to the Trump administration’s military blacklist. On Thursday, the Department of Defense added nine companies to its list of alleged Chinese military companies, including Xiaomi.Xiaomi was the world’s third-largest smartphone maker as of Q3 last year, coming ahead of Apple and trailing behind Samsung and Huawei, according to market researcher IDC.In November, President Donald Trump signed an executive order, which was set to take effect in January, to bar investment in companies designated as supporting efforts of China’s military, intelligence and security apparatuses. Huawei, China’s major chipmaker SMIC and the country’s three largest telecoms operators are among the targets of the list.The military blacklist is different from the Commerce Department’s entity list, which famously cuts Huawei, DJI, SenseTime and other Chinese tech firms off their U.S. suppliers over national security concerns.Xiaomi “confirms that it is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a ‘Communist Chinese Military Company’ defined under the NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act]. The company will take appropriate course of actions to protect the interests of the company and its shareholders,” a Xiaomi spokesperson said in a statement.Like the entity list, the U.S. government’s military blacklist has caused confusion around compliance. In response to the sanctions on China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the New York Stock Exchange made three moves. It first announced to delist the three Chinese telcos, then decided not to after consultation with regulators, but eventually reversed its reversal and said it would delist them, after all,\xa0upon further evaluation.The NYSE will delist three Chinese telecoms after all“The company is reviewing the potential consequences of this to develop a fuller understanding of its impact on the group. The company will make further announcements as and when appropriate,” the Xiaomi representative said.Xiaomi is listed in Hong Kong, and the executive order could force American investors to divest their holdings in the phone maker, whose shares tumbled more than 11%, to $29 apiece, on the blacklist announcement.While Xiaomi’s operations and technology access are unaffected in the latest round of U.S. government assault, a supply chain ban could become a sword of Damocles. The Chinese phone maker has been working closely with Qualcomm and was notably\xa0the first to get the high-end Snapdragon 888 chips. To evade restrictions imposed by the entity list, Huawei spun out its budget phone unit Honor in a bid to save its supply chain.

The enormous and noisy debut of Poshmark comes a day after Affirm, another IPO, was treated similarly by the public markets.Both explosive debuts were preceded by huge December debuts from C3.ai, Doordash and Airbnb. It seems today that any venture-backed company that can claim some sort of tech mantle is being treated to a strong IPO pricing run and a huge first-day result.This is, of course, annoying to some people. Namely, certain elements of the venture capital community who would prefer to keep all outsized gains in their own pockets. But, no matter. You might be wondering what is going on. Let’s talk about it.Here’s how you get a big first-day IPO popTechCrunch has covered the IPO window as closely as we can over the last few years. And the late-stage venture capital markets, along with the changing value of tech stocks and the huge boom in consumer (retail) investing.Based on my participation in as much of that reporting as I could take part in here’s how you get a 130% first-day IPO pop in a company that has actually been around long enough for investors to math-out reasonable growth and profit expectations for the future:Exist in a climate of near-zero interest rates. This leads to super-cheap money, bonds being shit and no one wanting to hold cash. Lots of dollars go into more speculative assets, like stocks.

https://t.co/YTojudVIRM,2021-01-14T22:42:29,Capsule raises $2 million for its collaborative video platform aimed at brands,"['Capsule, a video Q&A platform aimed at brands, emerged last year in direct response to the challenges companies were facing in terms of reaching consumers during the pandemic. Now, the business has closed on $2 million in pre-seed funding.\xa0The round was led by Array Ventures and included participation from Bloomberg Beta and other angels.The startup was founded by the same team that originally created the animated GIF capture tool and social network Phhhoto, which eventually lost out to Instagram’s\xa0clone, Boomerang. Phhhoto shut down in 2017 and the team pivoted to work on an experiential marketing business, Hypno. The new company had been working with brands that hosted live events and experiences as a way to connect with customers. Hypno would offer them things like photo booths and other camera platforms that allowed for interactivity.The COVID-19 pandemic essentially killed Hypno’s business as live events dried up. However, the brands Hypno had worked with still had the same needs — they just had to go about reaching their customers in a different way.Image Credits: CapsuleThat’s how Capsule came to exist. Launched last year, the startup offers a full platform for hosting Q&A sessions, where the brand starts with a template that they then customize to match their campaign by changing the logo, colors, buttons, background and URLs — sort of a like a Squarespace for the video Q&A format.The brand will then write their questions and prompts for consumers to answer, in the form of short video responses. This Q&A URL is distributed however the company chooses — like on social media, for example. A new feature also allows a “capsule” to be embedded on the website.The consumers’ responses to the Q&A are curated for the final video product. What makes the technology even more interesting is how Capsule assembles this footage.Capsule instantly and automatically processes the video, adding elements like music and graphics, pre-roll or post-roll, which makes the resulting video appear professionally edited. The startup does this by using its own JavaScript-based programming language that automates mixing of things like color, audio, graphics and dynamic type. All the customer has to do is select the kind of video they want — like one with an energetic feel or a more somber one, for instance.Today, Capsule has grown its library to about 20 base templates. But each of these can be edited by changing colors, styles and even the music — including either from direct uploads or from thousands of royalty-free tracks Capsule provides.https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Video.mp4\xa0According to Capsule co-founder Champ Bennett, the platform’s flexibility has led to a wide range of use cases. Though the company’s first customers had come from the live events space that Hypno had catered to, new customers soon began to adopt the product.“What we immediately started to hear from both our existing customers and then, suddenly, a bunch of new customers that were coming our way, is that the platform was useful in so many different contexts,” he explains. “For example, UGC [user-generated content] campaigns or generating social content to promote a business, or awareness, or product reviews and testimonials, or even creators who just wanted a faster way to make content that looked and felt a little bit more professional,” Bennett says.At launch, Capsule was used by companies like Netflix and organizations like OkayAfrica. It’s since landed contracts with hundreds of customers, including teams inside larger organizations like Google, Samsung, Salesforce, Deloitte and The Wall Street Journal, along with other small-to-medium businesses, like Paloma Health. The USO has also used Capsule.These brands and others are especially hungry for tools that help them create original, short-form video content, which is becoming a key way businesses are marketing their products and services. Capsule notes that studies have indicated video click-through rates are two-three times higher than static images and 95% of businesses are reporting an increase in their video spend year-over-year.The pandemic had accelerated the existing demand for video content, but brands faced challenges in terms of video being difficult to scale.“Increasingly, brands have started to kind of hack the way that they can create video,” says Bennett. “And one of the ways they’re doing that is by tapping into different creators within their organizations — whether it’s employees or founders or partners or influencers or fans of the brand or whatever it is — then activating them to create content on their behalf,” he continues. “We call this community-generated content, which is sort of like an iteration on user-generated content. It’s this idea that content can come from anywhere.”Capsule says it wanted to work with Array Ventures GP Shruti Gandhi, who has an engineering background, because she very deeply understood the core technology. She introduced the team to Bloomberg Beta in New York, which also immediately understood what Capsule was building, Bennett says.With the additional funds, Capsule will be hiring a product designer and will be developing new collaboration features, like the ability to upvote content.Longer-term, the company believes its platform will enable more people to get involved with video creation.“It turns out that there are so many different people within businesses who are capable of creating video content. They just don’t have the technical know-how to do it. They’re not video editors,” Bennett says. “So what we’re really doing is untapping this creative potential that exists inside of businesses everywhere, small and large.”']",acquired by Amazon for $1 billion,"['NavigationClose ScreenCapsule', 'CapsuleCapsule', 'Array Ventures', 'GIF', 'Phhhoto', 'Instagram’s', 'Phhhoto', 'Squarespace', 'Q&A', 'Capsule', 'JavaScript', 'Capsule', 'Champ Bennett', 'UGC', 'Bennett', 'Capsule', 'Netflix', 'Google', 'Deloitte', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'Paloma Health', 'USO', 'Capsule', 'Bennett', 'Array Ventures GP', 'Shruti Gandhi', 'Capsule', 'Bennett', 'Capsule', 'Bennett', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'VenturesCapsule', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

We list here all the active flexible VCs we have identified, broken into these categories:Revenue-basedCompensation-basedBlended-return streamsRevenue-based flexible VCsThese investors are paid back primarily based on a percentage of revenues.Capacity CapitalChattanooga, TN-based Capacity Capital was launched in 2020 with a primary focus on the southeastern U.S. Jonathan Bragdon, its CEO, describes Capacity as “a team of founders-turned-funders making non-dilutive, founder-aligned investments of $50,000-$300,000 in post-startup, post-revenue businesses planning to 2x revenues in 12-24 months. Investments are typically in exchange for a capped, single-digit revenue share and a right to equity under certain circumstances.If the company sells or raises enough capital, the investment converts into an agreed-upon percentage of equity. If the company grows without raising additional equity funding, founders redeem most of the equity right, based on a pre-agreed return amount. With a portfolio that includes food, tech and services, the fund is industry-agnostic and focused on the overlooked and underrepresented with high-margin business models.”Jonathan sometimes refers to their investments as “micro-mezzanine” because “mezz is typically structured as a contractual periodic payment, with some equity-like upside, but subordinate to other debt … so most lenders look at it like equity. But, it is typically shorter term with fewer control mechanisms than equity (i.e., not VC). I wanted [a term for] something similar (between debt and equity) but on an extremely small scale.”In addition to a fund, the overall Capacity organization provides direct mentorship, consulting and connects founders to a broad network of talent, diverse forms of capital and existing resources focused on the post-startup stage of growth.

https://t.co/ZPbcMDOLUr,2021-01-14T21:05:32,Home services platform Porch acquires four companies,"['Only a few weeks after its SPAC IPO, Porch today announced that it has made four acquisitions, worth a total of $122 million. The most important here is probably the acquisition of Homeowners of America for $100 million, which gets Porch deeper into the home insurance space. In addition, Porch is also acquiring mover marketing and data platform V12 for $22 million, as well as home inspection service Palm-Tech and iRoofing, a SaaS application for roofing contractors. Porch did not disclose the acquisition prices for the latter two companies.You may still think of Porch as a marketplace for home improvement and repair services — and that’s what it started out as when it launched about seven years ago. Yet while it still offers those services, a couple of years after its 2013 launch, the company pivoted to building what it now calls a “vertical software platform for the home.” Through a number of acquisitions, the Porch Group now includes Porch.com, as well as services like HireAHelper, Inspection Support Network for home inspectors, Kandela for providing services around moving and an insurance broker in the form of the Elite Insurance Group. In some form or another, Porch’s tools are now used — either directly or indirectly — by two-thirds of U.S. homebuyers every month.Porch founder and CEO Matt Ehrlichman. Image Credits: PorchAs Porch founder and CEO Matt Ehrlichman told me, he had originally planned to take his company public through a traditional IPO. He noted that going the increasingly popular SPAC route, though, allowed him to push his timeline up by a year, which in turn now enables the company to make the acquisitions it announced today.“In total, we had a $323 million fundraise that allows us now to not only be a public company with public currency, but to be very well capitalized. And picking up that year allows us to be able to go and pursue acquisitions that we think make really good fits for Porch,” Ehrlichman told me. While Porch’s guidance for its 2021 revenue was previously $120 million, it’s now updating that guidance to $170 million based on these acquisitions. That would mean Porch would grow its revenue by about 134% year-over-year between 2020 and 2021.As the company had previously laid out in its public documents, the plan for 2021 was always to get deeper into insurance. Indeed, as Ehrlichman noted, Porch these days tends to think of itself as a vertical software company that layers insurtech on top of its services in order to be able to create a recurring revenue stream. And because Porch offers such a wide range of services already, its customer acquisition costs are essentially zero for these services.Image Credits: Homeowners of AmericaPorch was already a licensed insurance brokerage. With Homeowners of America, it is acquiring a company that is both an insurance carrier as well as a managing general agent..“We’re able to capture all of the economic value from the consumer as we help them get insurance set up with their new home and we can really control that experience to delight them. As we wrap all the technology we’ve invested in around that experience we can make it super simple and instant to be able to get the right insurance at the right price for your new home. And because we have all of this data about the home that nobody else has — from the inspection we know if the roof is old, we know if the hot water system is gonna break soon and all the appliances — we know all of this data and so it just gives us a really big advantage in insurance.”Data, indeed, is what a lot of these acquisitions are about. Because Porch knows so much about so many customers, it is able to provide the companies it acquires with access to relevant data, which in turn helps them offer additional services and make smarter decisions.Homeowners of America is currently operating in six states (Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia) and licensed in 31. It has a network of more than 800 agencies so far and Porch expects to expand the company’s network and geographic reach in the coming months. “Because we have [customer acquisition cost]-free demand all across the country, one of the opportunities for us is simply just to expand that across the nation,” Ehrlichman explained.As for V12, Porch’s focus is on that company’s mover marketing and data platform. The acquisition should help it reach its medium-term goal of building a $200 million revenue stream in this area. V12 offers services across multiple verticals, though, including in the automotive space, and will continue to do so. The platform’s overall focus is to help brands identify the right time to reach out to a given consumer — maybe before they decide to buy a new car or move. With Porch’s existing data layered on top of V12’s existing capabilities, the company expects that it will be able to expand these features and it will also allow Porch to not offer mover marketing but what Ehrlichman called “pro-mover” services, as well.“V12 anchors what we call our marketing software division. A key focus of that is mover marketing. That’s where it’s going to have, long term, tremendous differentiation. But there are a number of other things that they’re working on that are going to have really nice growth vectors, and they’ll continue to push those,” said Ehrlichman.As for the two smaller acquisitions of iRoofing and Palm-Tech, these are more akin to some of the previous acquisitions the company made in the contractor and inspection verticals. Like with those previous acquisitions, the plan is to help them grow faster, in part through integrating them into the overall Porch group’s family of products.“Our business is and continues to be highly recurring or reoccurring in nature,” said Porch CFO Marty Heimbigner. “Nearly all of our revenues, including that of these new acquisitions, is consistent and predictable. This repeat revenue is also high margin with less than 20% cost of revenue and is expected to grow more than 30% per year on our platform. So, we believe these deals are highly accretive for our shareholders.”']",Goddard Institute for Space Studies,"['Porch', 'NavigationClose', 'Porch', 'Halfpoint Images / Getty ImagesOnly', 'Porch', 'Homeowners of America', 'Porch', 'V12', 'Palm-Tech', 'iRoofing', 'Porch', 'the Porch Group', 'Porch.com', 'Inspection Support Network', 'Kandela', 'the Elite Insurance Group', 'Porch’s', 'Matt Ehrlichman', 'PorchAs Porch', 'Matt Ehrlichman', 'Porch', 'Porch’s', 'Porch', 'Porch', 'AmericaPorch', 'Homeowners of America', 'Homeowners of America', 'Porch', 'V12', 'Porch’s', 'V12', 'Porch’s', 'V12', 'Porch', 'iRoofing', 'Palm-Tech', 'Porch CFO', 'Marty Heimbigner', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Acquisitionsnorth', 'Porch', 'Homeowners of Am', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The bug made it possible to retrieve the location data on users who posted to the app, including those who are reporting crimes.But the exposed data wasn’t visible to anyone using the app. Rather, the bug was retrieving hidden data, including the user’s latitude and longitude and their home address, from Ring’s servers.Another problem was that every post was tied to a unique number generated by the server that incremented by one each time a user created a new post. Although the number was hidden from view to the app user, the sequential post number made it easy to enumerate\xa0the location data from previous posts — even from users who aren’t geographically nearby.Ring Neighbors app (left), and the data it was pulling in, including location data (right).

We have not identified any evidence of this information being accessed or used maliciously,” said Ring spokesperson Yassi Shahmiri.Last year Gizmodo found a similar bug in the Neighbors app that revealed hidden location data, allowing them to map out thousands of Ring users across the United States.Ring currently faces a class-action suit by dozens of people who say they were subjected to death threats and racial slurs after their Ring smart cameras were hacked. In response to the hacks, Ring put much of the blame on users for not using “best practices” like two-factor authentication, which makes it harder for hackers to access a user’s account with the user’s password.After it emerged that hackers were reportedly creating tools to break into Ring accounts and over 1,500 user account passwords were found on the dark web, Ring made two-factor authentication mandatory for every user.The smart tech maker has also faced increasing criticism from civil rights groups and lawmakers for its cozy relationship with hundreds of U.S. police departments that have partnered with Ring for access to homeowners’ doorbell camera footage.Over 1,500 Ring passwords have been found on the dark web']",TechCrunch List,"['Amazon’s', 'NavigationClose ScreenAmazon’s', 'Jessica Hill', 'Ring’s Neighbors', 'Amazon', 'Neighbors', 'Nextdoor', 'Citizen', 'Ring’s', 'Yassi Shahmiri', 'Gizmodo', 'Neighbors', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Ring’s Neighbors', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/akp4VeTy2K,2021-01-14T20:19:37,"Exclusive: Tiger Global is raising a new $3.75 billion venture fund, one year after closing its last","['According to a recent letter sent to its investors, Tiger Global Management, the New York-based investing powerhouse, is raising a new $3.75 billion venture fund called Tiger Private Investment Partners XIV that it expects to close in March.The fund is Tiger Global’s thirteenth venture fund, despite its title — the partners might be superstitious — and it comes hot on the heels of the firm’s twelfth venture fund, closed exactly a year ago, also with $3.75 billion in capital commitments.A spokesperson for the firm declined to comment on the letter or Tiger Global’s broader fundraising strategy when reached this morning.It’s a lot of capital to target, even amid a sea of enormous new venture vehicles. New Enterprise Associates closed its newest fund with $3.6 billion last year. Lightspeed Venture Partners soon after announced $4 billion across three funds. Andreessen Horowitz, the youngest of the three firms, announced in November it had closed a pair of funds totaling $4.5 billion.At the same time, Tiger Global seemingly has a strong case to present potential limited partners. Last year alone, numerous of its portfolio companies either went public or were acquired.A16z is now managing $16.5 billion, after announcing two new fundsYatsen Holding, the nearly five-year-old parent company of China-based cosmetics giant Perfect Diary, went public in November and is now valued at $14 billion. (Tiger Global’s ownership stake didn’t merit a mention on the company’s regulatory filing.)Tiger Global also quietly invested in the cloud-based data warehousing outfit Snowflake and, while again, it didn’t have a big enough stake to be included in the company’s S-1, even a tiny ownership percentage would be valuable, given that Snowflake is now valued at $85 billion.And Tiger Global backed Root insurance, a nearly six-year-old, Columbus, Ohio-based insurance company that went public in November and currently boasts a market cap of $5.3 billion. Tiger owned 10.3% sailing into the offering.3 lessons from Root’s IPO pricingAs for M&A, Tiger Global saw at least three of its companies swallowed by bigger tech companies during 2020, including Postmates’s all-stock sale to Uber for $2.65 billion; Credit Karma’s $7 billion sale in cash and stock to Intuit; and the sale of Kustomer, which focused on customer service platforms and chatbots, for $1 billion to Facebook.Tiger Global, whose roots are in hedge fund management, launched its private equity business in 2003, spearheaded by Chase Coleman, who’d previously worked for hedge-fund pioneer Julian Robertson at Tiger Management; and Scott Shleifer, who joined the firm in 2002 after spending three years with the Blackstone Group. Lee Fixel, who would become a key contributor in the business, joined in 2006.Shleifer focused on China, Fixel focused on India and the rest of the firm’s support team (it now has 22 investing professionals on staff) helped find deals in Brazil and Russia before beginning to focus more aggressively on opportunities in the U.S.Every investing decision was eventually made by each of the three. Fixel left in 2019 to launch his own investment firm, Addition. Now Shleifer and Coleman are the firm’s sole decision-makers.Lee Fixel is leaving Tiger GlobalWhether the firm eventually replaces Fixel is an open question, though it doesn’t appear to be the plan. Tiger Global is known for grooming investors within its operations rather than hiring outsiders, so a new top lieutenant would almost surely come from its current team.In the meantime, the firm’s private equity arm — which has written everything from Series A checks (Warby Parker) to checks in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars — is currently managing assets of $30 million, compared with the $49 billion that Tiger is managing more broadly.A year ago, Tiger Global, which employs 100 people altogether, was reportedly managing $36.2 billion in assets.According to the outfit’s investor letter, the firm’s gross internal rate of return across its 12 previous funds is 32%, while its net IRR is 24%.Tiger Global’s investors include a mix of sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments, pensions and its own employees, who are collectively believed to be the firm’s biggest investors at this point.Some of Tiger Global’s biggest wins to date have included a $200 million bet on the e-commerce giant JD.com that produced a $5 billion for the firm. According to the WSJ, it also cleared more than $1 billion on the Chinese online-services platform Meituan, which went public in 2018.Checkout.com raises $450 million and reaches $15 billion valuationTiger Global also reportedly reaped $3 billion from majority sale of India’s Flipkart to Walmart in 2018,\xa0 though the Indian government has more recently been trying to recover $1.9 billion from the firm, claiming it has outstanding tax due on the sale of its share in the company.One outcome that might surprise even Tiger Global’s investors ties to the connected fitness company Peloton, 20% of which the firm owned at the time of Peloton’s\xa0 2019 IPO (a deal that Fixel reportedly brought to the table, along with Flipkart). By adding new users throughout the pandemic, Peloton — which was valued by private investors at $4 billion and doubled in value immediately as a publicly traded company — now boasts a market cap of $48.6 billion.Tiger Global has invested its current fund in roughly 50 companies over the last 12 months.Among its newest bets is Blend, an eight-year-old, San Francisco-based digital lending platform that yesterday announced $300 million in Series G funding, including from Coatue, at a post-money valuation of $3.3 billion.It also led the newly announced $450 million Series C round for Checkout.com, an eight-year-old, London-based online payments platform that is now valued at $15 billion. And it wrote a follow-on check to Cockroach Labs, the nearly six-year-old, New York-based distributed SQL database that just raised $160 million in Series E funding at a $2 billion valuation, just eight months after raising an $86.6 million Series D round.Cockroach Labs scores $160M Series E on $2B valuationAnother of its newest, biggest bets centers on the online education platform Zuowebang, in China. Back in June, Tiger Global co-led a $750 million Series E round in the company.Last month, it\xa0was back again, co-leading a $1.6 billion round in the distance-learning company.Pictured: Scott Shleifer, partner and head of private equity at Tiger Global Management, right, speaks with an attendee during the UJA-Federation of New York Wall Street Dinner in New York, on Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2011.\xa0']",ISpot.tv,"['NavigationClose', 'Tiger Global', 'Gordon / Getty ImagesAccording', 'Tiger Private Investment Partners', 'Tiger Global’s', 'New Enterprise Associates', 'Venture Partners', 'Andreessen Horowitz', 'Tiger Global', 'Global', 'Tiger Global', 'Root', 'Root’s', 'Tiger Global', 'Postmates’s', 'Uber', 'Credit Karma’s', 'Intuit', 'Tiger Global', 'Chase Coleman', 'Julian Robertson', 'Tiger Management', 'Scott Shleifer', 'the Blackstone Group', 'Lee Fixel', 'Fixel', 'U.S.Every', 'Shleifer', 'Coleman', 'Lee Fixel', 'Tiger GlobalWhether', 'Fixel', 'Tiger Global', 'Parker', 'Tiger Global', 'IRR', 'Global’s', 'WSJ', 'Global', 'India’s', 'Flipkart to Walmart', 'Tiger Global’s', 'Peloton', 'Peloton’s', 'Fixel', 'Peloton', 'Tiger Global', 'Checkout.com', 'Cockroach Labs', 'SQL', 'Cockroach Labs', 'Tiger Global', 'Scott Shleifer', 'Tiger Global Management', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Tiger Global', 'Tiger Private Investment Par', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/YEHiuB19rL,2021-01-14T20:04:56,2020 was one of the warmest years in history and indicates mounting risks of climate change,"['It’s official. 2020 was one of the warmest years on record, either edging out or coming in just behind 2016 for the warmest year in recorded history according to data from U.S. government agencies (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had the year just tied with 2016, while the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration put the figure just behind 2016’s totals).No matter the ranking, the big picture for the climate isn’t pretty, according to scientists from NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York and the Washington, DC-based NOAA.“The last seven years have been the warmest seven years on record, typifying the ongoing and dramatic warming trend,” said GISS Director\xa0Gavin Schmidt, in a statement. “Whether one year is a record or not is not really that important – the important things are long-term trends. With these trends, and as the human impact on the climate increases, we have to expect that records will continue to be broken.”Bill Gates just released a plan for US leadership on climate change, including $35B in fundingThat’s a dire message for the nation considering the cost of last year’s record-breaking  22 weather and climate disasters. At least 262 people died and scores more were injured by climate-related disasters, according to the NOAA.And the combination of wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, tornados, tropical cyclones and severe weather events like hail storms in Texas and the derecho that wrecked the Midwest cost the nation $95 billion.Homes are engulfed in flames in Vacaville, California during the LNU Lightning Complex fire on August 19, 2020. As of the late hours of August 18, 2020 the Hennessey fire has merged with at least 7 fires and is now called the LNU Lightning Complex fires. Dozens of fires are burning out of control throughout Northern California as fire resources are spread thin. (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images)Both organizations track temperature trends to get some sort of picture of the impact that human activities — specifically greenhouse gas emissions — have on the planet. The image that comes into focus is that human activity has already contributed to increasing Earth’s average temperature by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the industrial age took hold in the late 19th century.Most troubling to scientists is that this year’s near record-setting temperatures happened without a boost from the climatic weather phenomenon known as El Niño, which is a large-scale ocean-atmosphere climate interaction linked to a periodic warming.“The previous record warm year, 2016, received a significant boost from a strong El Niño. The lack of a similar assist from El Niño this year is evidence that the background climate continues to warm due to greenhouse gases,” Schmidt said, in a statement.The warming trends the word is experiencing are most pronounced in the Arctic, according to NASA. There, temperatures have warmed three times as a fast as the rest of the globe over the past 30 years, Schmidt said. The loss of Arctic sea ice — whose annual minimum area is declining by about 13% per decade — makes the region less reflective, which means more sunlight is being absorbed by oceans, causing temperatures to climb even more.These accelerating effects of climate change could be perilous for the world at large, Katharine Hayhoe, a professor at Texas Tech University wrote in an email to The Washington Post.“What keeps us climate scientists up in the dead of night is wondering what we don’t know about the self-reinforcing or vicious cycles in the Earth’s climate system,” Hayhoe wrote. “The further and faster we push it beyond anything experienced in the history of human civilization on this planet, the greater the risk of serious and even dangerous consequences. And this year, we’ve seen that in spades… It’s no longer a question of when the impacts of climate change will manifest themselves: They are already here and now. The only question remaining is how much worse it will get.”Carbon dioxide emissions are set to hit a record high this year (it’s not fine, but not hopeless)']",Philips Hue’s new Play gradient lightstrip promises a big upgrade for home entertainment spaces,"['Justin Sullivan / Getty ImagesIt’s', 'The National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', 'NASA', 'Goddard Institute for Space Studies', 'Schmidt', 'JOSH EDELSON', 'AFP', 'Getty Images)Both', 'Fahrenheit', 'El Niño', 'El Niño', 'El Niño', 'Schmidt', 'NASA', 'Schmidt', 'Katharine Hayhoe', 'Texas Tech University', 'The Washington Post', 'Hayhoe', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/J6auSvw7go,2021-01-14T19:54:58,5 consumer hardware VCs share their 2021 investment strategies,"['Consumer hardware has always been a tough market to crack, but the COVID-19 crisis made it even harder.TechCrunch surveyed five key investors who touch different aspects of the consumer electronics industry, based on our TechCrunch List of top VCs recommended by founders, along with other sources.We asked these investors the same six questions, and each provided similar thoughts, but different approaches:Hans Tung, managing partner, GGV CapitalDayna Grayson, co-founder and general partner, Construct CapitalCyril Ebersweiler, general partner, SOSVBilal Zuberi, partner, Lux CapitalRob Coneybeer, managing director, Shasta VenturesDespite the pandemic, each identified bright spots in the consumer electronic world. One thing is clear, investors are generally bullish on at-home fitness startups. Multiple respondents cited Peloton, Tonal and Mirror as recent highlights in consumer electronics.Said Shasta Venture’s Rob Coneybeer, “With all due respect to my friends at Nest (where Shasta was a Series A investor), Tonal is the most exciting consumer connected hardware company I’ve ever been involved with.”Besides asking about the trends and opportunities they’re pursuing in 2021, the investors we spoke to also identified other investors, founders and companies who are leaders in consumer hardware and shared how they’ve reshaped their investment strategies during the pandemic. Their responses have been edited for space and clarity.Hans Tung, GGV CapitalWhich consumer hardware sector shows the most promise for explosive growth?For consumer hardware, offering end users a differentiated experience is extremely important. Social interactions, gamification and high-quality PGC (professionally generated content) such as with Peloton, Xiaomi and Tonal is a must to drive growth. It’s also easy to see how the acceleration of the digital economy created by COVID-19 will also drive growth for hardware.First, services improved by the speed and reliability of 5G such as live streaming, gaming, cloud computing, etc. will create opportunity for new mobile devices and global mass market consumers will continue to demand high-quality, low-cost hardware. For example, Arevo is experimenting with “hardware as a service” with a 3D printing facility in Vietnam.For enterprise hardware, security, reliability and fast updates are key competitive advantages. Also as a result of 5G… manufacturing automation and industrial applications. Finally IoT for health and safety may find its sweet spot thanks to COVID-19 with new wearables that track sleep, fitness and overall wellness.How did COVID-19 change consumer hardware and your investment strategy?One opportunity for consumer hardware companies to consider as a result of COVID-19 is how they engage with their customers. They should think of themselves more like e-commerce companies, where user experience, ongoing engagement with the consumer and iteration based on market feedback rule the day. While Peloton had this approach well before COVID, it has built a $46 billion company thinking about their products in this way.For example, some consumers felt the bike was too expensive so instead of responding with a low-end product, the company partnered with Affirm to make their hardware more affordable with pay-as-you-go plans. A Peloton bike is not a one-and-done purchase; there is constant interaction between users, and the company that drives more satisfaction in the hardware adds more value in the business.Entering 2021, in what way is hardware still hard?Hardware is still hard because it takes more to iterate fast. The outcome for competitors relative to speed-to-market can be dramatic. For example, every year I look at future generation of EVs with lots of innovations and cool features from existing OEMs but see very few of these making it to market compared to Tesla and other pure players that are cranking out vehicles. Their speed of execution is impressive.Who are some leaders in consumer hardware — founders, companies, investors?John Foley, founder and CEO of Peloton. John and the Peloton team have cracked the code on the integration of community experience and hardware.Sonny Vu, founder of Misfit and founder/CEO of Arevo, maker of ultrastrong, lightweight continuous carbon fiber products on demand. Experienced founder and team with 3D printing manufacturing know-how at scale are now able to offer breakthrough consumer and industrial products at competitive prices.Manu Jain, head of Xiaomi’s business in India where Xiaomi is the #1-selling smart phone. He built the Indian operation from the ground up; had zero dollar marketing budget for the first three years; and localized manufacturing for all Xiaomi phones sold in India.Jim Xiao, founder and CEO of Mason, a rising star who is creating “mobile infrastructure as a service.”Irving Fain, founder and CEO of Bowery Farming. Irving and his team are on a mission to reimagine modern farming.Is there anything else you would like to share with TechCrunch readers?Worry less about trends and build products that resonate with customers.\xa0Dayna Grayson, Construct Capital']",Medium,"['Ezra Shaw', 'Hans Tung', 'CapitalDayna Grayson', 'Construct CapitalCyril Ebersweiler', 'SOSVBilal Zuberi', 'Lux CapitalRob Coneybeer', 'Peloton, Tonal and', 'Mirror', 'Rob Coneybeer', 'Hans Tung', 'PGC', 'Peloton', 'Xiaomi and Tonal', 'COVID-19', 'Arevo', '3D', 'IoT', 'COVID-19', 'Peloton', 'Affirm', 'Peloton', 'Tesla', 'Foley', 'Peloton', 'John', 'Peloton', 'Sonny Vu', 'Manu Jain', 'Xiaomi’s', 'Jim Xiao', 'Mason', 'Bowery Farming', 'Irving', 'Dayna Grayson', 'Construct CapitalSign', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CapitalConstruct Capitalconsumer', 'strategies“Tesla', 'Apple', 'Matt Burns8:54', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

After all, he said, “In simple terms, there are only two reasons why brands buy advertising — one is to deliver business results and the other is to build brand recognition, likability and impact.”The existing iSpot platform excels in the first area, Muller said, measuring the reach and conversation rates of ads that run on both TV and streaming. Ace Metrix, on the other hand, measures how an ad affects consumer sentiment — so by bringing the two companies together, it can offer “a complete solution in one platform.”Muller added that measuring the brand impact of an ad has become even more important as marketers try to navigate a constantly changing news landscape (to put it mildly).“Brands are being forced to have a say in politics and all sorts of things,” he said. “Understanding the way your messages are being perceived is crucially important … When you invest in a piece of creative, it becomes even more important to ensure that your message is on point and triggers the right emotions.”iSpot.tv Raises $21.9M To Track The Online Impact Of TV AdvertisingAce Metrix had raised $25 million in funding from investors including Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, WPP, Palomar Ventures and Leapfrog Ventures, according to Crunchbase.The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but iSpot says Ace’s 45 employees will all be joining the company, bringing total headcount to 240, with Ace CEO Peter Daboll becoming iSpot’s chief strategy officer. Ace will also maintain its office in Los Angeles (iSpot is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington).Muller also noted that Ace had annualized SaaS revenues “north of the double digit millions” and that it was cashflow positive. The combined company has annual contracts with more than 500 brands.“We’re integrating the companies together very quickly — it’s already underway,” he said. “We’re going to be one company, one vision and so the Ace products become part of the iSpot product suite.

https://t.co/tOZjxitzmj,2021-01-14T19:14:09,This new module keeps Philips Hue bulbs connected even when the wall switch gets flipped,"['Philips Hue bulbs are pretty great, but they have a mortal enemy: the humble light switch. If you’ve got a Hue bulb tied to a standard light switch, flipping that switch means the Hue bulb loses power completely… along with any fancy tricks like controlling the bulb through your phone or a voice assistant.A few solutions for this exist, but mostly involve swapping out the switch in question for something with a bit more smarts. This morning Signify (the company previously known as Philips Lighting) announced an official solution that works with your existing switches, albeit with a caveat or two.Called the “wall switch module,” it’s expected to ship later this year — spring if you’re in Europe, or summer if you’re in North America. Once wired up, it turns your existing light switch into something more like a Hue controller, allowing it to toggle between different light presets rather than simply cutting power.At $40 each (or $70 for a two-pack), it’s… not cheap. Add in the fact that it’s powered by a battery (presumably to remove the need for a neutral wire and simplify installation) with an estimated lifespan of ~five years, this probably isn’t something you want to implement house-wide. But for a single light switch or two, it seems like a decent solution.The company also announced a few new Hue accessories, in case you’re looking to expand your collection:\xa0A revised version of its portable dimmer switch, which will ship in February and cost $25. The separate on/off buttons are becoming a single toggle, and a “Hue” button is being added to let you trigger a specific lighting scene.A new light bar, the Philips Hue Amarant, which is meant to live outside and be mounted on the ground or an overhang. It’ll ship in March in North America, and cost $170 each (though you’ll also need an outdoor Hue power supply box, which will add $60-$70 to the price if you don’t have one already.)Philips Hue’s new Play gradient lightstrip promises a big upgrade for home entertainment spaces']",Beyond Meat,"['Philips Hue', 'NavigationClose', 'Philips Hue', 'Kumparak@grg /', 'PhilipsPhilips Hue', 'Philips Lighting', 'the Philips Hue Amarant', 'Hue’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Philips Hue', 'Kumparak8:14', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'Steve Loughlin', 'Ironclad', 'Jason BoehmigJordan Crook6:15 PM', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Dhzvh18Jtu,2021-01-14T18:31:00,Medium acquires social book reading app Glose,"['Medium is acquiring Paris-based startup Glose for an undisclosed amount. Glose has been building iOS, Android and web apps that let you buy, download and read books on your devices.The company has turned reading into a multiplayer experience, as you can build a bookshelf, share notes with your followers and start conversations in the margins. Sure, there are social platforms that let you talk about books, such as Goodreads. But Glose’s differentiating point is that the social features are intrinsically linked with the reading features — those aren’t two separate platforms. There are also some gamification features that help you stay motivated as you read difficult books — you get streak rewards for instance.In many ways, Glose’s one-tap highlighting and commenting features are reminiscent of Medium’s features on this front. You can highlight text in any reading app on your phone or tablet but you can’t do much with it.More recently, Glose has launched a separate service called Glose Education. As the name suggests, that version is tailored for universities and high schools. Teachers can hand out assignments and you can read a book as a group.More than 1 million people have used Glose and 25 universities have signed up to Glose Education, including Stanford and Columbia University.But Glose isn’t just a software play. The company has also put together a comprehensive bookstore. The company has partnered with 20,000 publishers so that you can buy e-books directly from the app.And if you are studying Virginia Wolf this semester, Glose also provides hundreds of thousands of public domain books for free. Glose also supports audio books.This is by far the most interesting part, as Medium now plans to expand beyond articles and blogs. While Glose is sticking around for now, Medium also plans to integrate e-books and audio books to its service.It’s a smart move, as many prolific bloggers are also book writers. Right now, they write a blog post on Medium and link to a third-party site if you want to buy their books. Having the ability to host everything written by an author is a better experience for both content creators and readers.“We’re impressed not only by Glose’s reading products and technology, but also by their experience in partnering with book authors and publishers,” Medium CEO Ev Williams said in a statement. “Books are a means of exploring an idea, a way to go deeper.

https://t.co/6Nf3ZsKO54,2021-01-14T18:29:37,Confusion over WhatsApp’s new T&Cs triggers privacy warning from Italy,"['Confusion over an update to Facebook-owned chat platform WhatsApp’s terms and conditions has triggered an intervention by Italy’s data protection agency.The Italian GPDP said today it has contacted the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to raise concerns about a lack of clear information over what’s changing under the incoming T&Cs.In recent weeks WhatsApp has been alerting users they must accept new T&Cs in order to keep using the service after February 8.A similar alert over updated terms has also triggered concerns in India — where a petition was filed today in the Delhi High Court alleging the new terms are a violation of users’ fundamental rights to privacy and pose a threat to national security.In a notification on its website the Italian agency writes that it believes it is not possible for WhatsApp users to understand the changes that are being introduced under the new terms, nor to “clearly understand which data processing will actually be carried out by the messaging service after February 8.”Screengrab of the T&Cs alert being shown to WhatsApp users in Europe. Image Credits: TechCrunch.For consent to be a valid legal basis for processing personal data under EU law the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that users are properly informed of each specific use and given a free choice over whether their data is processed for each purpose.The Italian agency adds that it reserves the right to intervene “as a matter of urgency” in order to protect users and enforce EU laws on the protection of personal data.We reached out to the EDPB with questions about the GPDP’s intervention. The steering body’s role is typically to act as a liaison between EU DPAs. But it also issues guidance on the interpretation of EU law and can step in to cast the deciding vote in cases where there is disagreement on cross-border EU investigations.It told us there was “an exchange of views” on the topic at yesterday’s plenary meeting.“The matter will most likely be further discussed at a later date,” it added. “Please note that SAs [supervisory authorities] regularly exchange information on cases within the context of the one-Stop-Shop.“The EDPB has played its role in promoting cooperation between SAs, and will continue to facilitate such exchanges between authorities, in order to ensure a consistent application of data protection law across the EU in accordance with its mandate.”E2E encrypted email providers also see sign-ups surge as chat app users flock to Signal and Telegram in search of privacyEarlier this week Turkish antitrust authorities also announced they are investigating WhatsApp’s updated T&Cs — objecting to what they claimed are differences in how much data will be shared with Facebook under the new terms in Europe and outside.While on Monday, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission — which is WhatsApp’s lead data regulator in the EU — told us the messaging app has given it a commitment EU users are not affected by any broader change to data-sharing practices. So Facebook’s lead regulator in the EU has not raised any objections to the new WhatsApp T&Cs.WhatsApp itself has also claimed there are no changes at all to its data sharing practices anywhere in the world under this update.Clearly there’s been a communications failure somewhere along the chain — which makes the Italian objection to a lack of clarity in the wording of the new T&Cs seem reasonable.Reached for comment on the GDPD’s intervention, a WhatsApp spokesperson told us:We are reviewing the Garante’s announcement regarding WhatsApp’s Privacy Policy update. We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way or require Italian users to agree to new data-sharing practices with Facebook. Instead, this update provides further transparency about how we collect and use data, as well as clarifying changes related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional. We remain committed to providing everyone in Italy with private end-to-end encrypted messaging.How exactly the Italian agency could intervene over the WhatsApp T&Cs is an interesting question. (And, indeed, we’ve reached out to the GPDP with questions.)The GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism means cross-border complaints get funneled through a lead data supervisor where a company has its main regional base (Ireland in WhatsApp’s case). But as noted above, Ireland has — thus far — said it doesn’t have a problem with WhatsApp’s updated T&Cs.However under the GDPR, other DPAs do have powers to act off their own bat when they believe there is a pressing risk to users’ data.Such as, in 2019, when the Hamburg DPA ordered Google to stop manual reviews of snippets of Google Assistant users’ audio (which it had been reviewing as part of a grading program).In that case Hamburg informed Google of its intention to use the GDPR’s Article 66 powers — which allows a national agency to order data processing to stop if it believes there is “an urgent need to act in order to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects” — which immediately led to Google suspending human reviews across Europe.The tech giant later amended how the program operates. The Hamburg DPA didn’t even need to use Article 66 — just the mere threat of the order to stop processing was enough.Some 1.5 years later and there are signs many EU data protection agencies — outside a couple of key jurisdictions that oversee the lion’s share of big tech — are becoming frustrated by perceived regulatory inaction against big tech.So there may be an increased willingness among these agencies to resort to creative procedures of their own to protect citizens’ data. (And it’s certainly interesting to note that France’s CNIL recently slapped Amazon and Google with big fines over cookie consents — acting under the ePrivacy Directive, which does not include a GDPR-style one-stop-shop mechanism.)In related news this week, an opinion by an advisor to the EU’s top court also appears to be responding to concern at GDPR enforcement bottlenecks.In the opinion Advocate General Bobek takes the view that the law allows national DPAs to bring their own proceedings in certain situations — including in order to adopt “urgent measures” or to intervene “following the lead data protection authority having decided not to handle a case.”The CJEU ruling on that case is still pending but the court tends to align with the position of its advisors so it seems likely we’ll see data protection enforcement activity increasing across the board from EU DPAs in the coming years, rather than being stuck waiting for a few DPAs to issue all the major decisions.GDPR enforcement must level up to catch big tech, report warns\nThis report was updated with comment from the EDPB']",General Fusion,"['WhatsApp’s', 'NavigationClose ScreenConfusion', 'WhatsApp', 'ItalyNatasha', 'Brent Lewin/Bloomberg', 'Getty ImagesConfusion', 'WhatsApp’s', 'the European Data Protection Board', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'EU', 'the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'WhatsApp’s', 'Ireland’s Data Protection Commission', 'WhatsApp’s', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp’s', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp’s', 'WhatsApp’s', 'The Hamburg DPA', 'EU', 'Amazon', 'the ePrivacy Directive', 'Advocate General Bobek', 'CJEU', 'EU', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp’s', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/nEstbXs2FG,2021-01-14T18:20:18,Swimm raises $5.7M to help teams document their code,"['Most developers don’t enjoy writing documentation for their code and that makes life quite a bit harder when a new team member tries to get started on working on a company’s codebase. And even when there are documentation or in-line comments in the source code, that’s often not updated, and, over time, that information becomes close to irrelevant. Swimm, which today announced that it has raised a $5.7 million seed round, aims to automate as much of this process as possible after the initial documentation has been written by automatically updating it as changes are made.The funding round was led by Pitango First, with TAU Ventures, Axon Ventures and FundFire also investing in this round, together with a group of angel investors that include the founder of developer platform Snyk.Image Credits: SwimmSwimm’s marketing mostly focuses on helping teams speed up onboarding, but it’s probably a useful tool for any team. Using Swimm, you can create the standard — but auto-updated — documentation, but also walkthroughs and tutorials. Using its code browser, you also can easily find all of the documentation that relates to a given file.The nifty part here is that while the tool can’t write the documentation for you, Swimm will automatically update any code examples in the documentation for you — or alert you when there is a major change that needs a manual update. Ideally, this will reduce the drift between the codebase and documentation.Image Credits: SwimmThe founding team members — Oren Toledano (CEO), Omer Rosenbaum (CTO), Gilad Navot (chief product officer) and Tom Ahi Dror (chief business officer) — started working on this problem based on their experience while running Israel Tech Challenge, a coding bootcamp inspired by the training program used by the Israeli Defence Forces’ 8200 Intelligence Unit.“We met with many companies in Israel and in the U.S. to understand the engineering onboarding process,” Toledano told me. “And we felt that it was kind of broken — and many times, we heard the sentence: ‘we throw them to the water, and they either sink or swim.’ ” (That’s also why the company is called Swimm). Companies, he argues, often don’t have a way to train new employees on their code base, simply because it’s impossible for them to do so effectively without good documentation.“The larger the company is, the more scattered the knowledge on the code base is — and a lot of this knowledge leaves the company when developers leave,” he noted.With Swimm, a company could ideally not just offer those new hires access to tutorials that are based on the current code base, but also an easier entryway to start working on the production codebase as well.Image Credits: SwimmOne thing that’s worth noting here is that developers run Swimm locally on a developer’s machine. In part, that’s because this approach reduces the security risks since no code is ever sent to Swimm’s servers. Indeed, the Swimm team tells me that some of its early customers are security companies. It also makes it easier for new users to get started with Swimm.Toledano tells me that while the team mostly focused on building the core of the product and working with its early design partners (and its first set of paying customers), the plan for the next few months is to bring on more users after launching the product’s beta.“Software development is now at the core of every modern business. Swimm provides a structured, contextual and transparent way to improve developer productivity,” said Yair Cassuto, a partner at Pitango First who is joining Swimm‘s board. “Swimm’s solution allows for rapid and insightful onboarding on any codebase.

https://t.co/f3xkIcYr9M,2021-01-14T17:42:51,Nuclear fusion tech developer General Fusion now has Shopify and Amazon founders backing it,"['In a brief announcement today, the Canadian nuclear fusion technology developer General Fusion announced that the investment firm created by Shopify founder Tobias Lütke has joined the company’s cap table.The size of the investment made by Lütke’s Thistledown Capital was not disclosed, but with the addition, General Fusion has the founders of the two biggest e-commerce companies in the Western world on its cap table.Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, first invested in the company nearly a decade ago and General Fusion has been steadily raising cash since that time. In 2019, the company hauled in $100 million. That capital commitment is part of a haul totaling at least, $192 million, according to Crunchbase although the real figure is likely higher.Indeed, General Fusion kept adding cash throughout 2020 as it looked to develop its demonstration fusion reactor.General Fusion’s process is based on technology called magnetized target fusion (MTF), first proposed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab and developed in the 1970s.The process involves creating a magnetically confined moderately warm plasma of around 100 eV (roughly 50 times the photon energy of visible light) in a flux conserver (a shell that preserves the magnetic field). By rapidly compressing the flux conserver and the magnetic field inside of it surrounding the plasma, the plasma is superheated to a temperature that can initiate a fast fusion burn and create a fusion reaction, according to a 2017 description of the technology from General Fusion’s chief science officer and founder, Michel Laberge.The company uses a roughly three-meter sphere filled with molten lead-lithium that’s pumped to form a cavity. A pulse of magnetically confined plasma fuel is then injected into the cavity. Then, around the sphere, pistons create a pressure wave into the middle of the sphere, compressing the plasma to fusion conditions.Neutrons escaping from the fusion reaction are captured in the liquid metal, and the heat from that metal generates electricity via a steam turbine. A heat exchanger steam turbine produces the power and the steam is recycled to run the pistons.In recent years, both General Fusion and its main North American competitor Commonwealth Fusion Systems have made strides in getting their small-scale nuclear fusion technology ready for commercialization.In the past, the wry joke about fusion technologies was that they were always 10 years away, but now companies are looking at a four-year horizon to bring fusion to initial markets, if not the masses.For its part, Commonwealth Fusion Systems is in the process of building a 10-ton magnet that has the magnetic force equivalent to 20 MRI machines. “After we get the magnet to work, we’ll be building a machine that will generate more power than it takes to run. We see that as the Kitty Hawk moment [for fusion],” said Bob Mumgaard, the chief executive of Commonwealth Fusion in an interview last year.Other startup companies are also racing to bring technologies to market and hit the 2025 timeline like the\xa0United Kingdom’s\xa0Tokamak Energy.With $84 million in new cash, Commonwealth Fusion is on track for a demonstration fusion reactor by 2025Like General Fusion, Commonwealth also has deep-pocketed backers including the Bill Gates-backed sustainable-technology-focused investor, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. In all, those investors have committed over $200 million to the company, which formally launched in 2018.As these companies begin readying their technologies for market, governments are laying the groundwork to make it easier for them to commercialize.At the end of last year, the Trump administration signed the COVID relief and omnibus appropriations bill that included an amendment to support the development of fusion energy in the U.S.The new amendment directed the Department of Energy to carry out a fusion energy sciences research and development program; authorized DOE programs in inertial fusion energy and alternative concepts to find new ways forward for fusion power; reauthorized the INFUSE program to create public-private partnerships between national labs and fusion developers; and created a milestone-based development program to support companies not just through R&D, but into the construction of full-scale systems.It’s this milestone program that was a cornerstone of the policy work that the Fusion Industry Association wanted to see in the U.S., according to a December statement from the organization.By unlocking $325 million in financing over a five-year period, the U.S. government will actually double its research with matching contributions from the fusion industry. These demonstration facilities could go a long way toward accelerating the deployment of fusion technologies.Founded in 2019, Thistledown Capital was formed to invest in tech that can decarbonize industry. The firm, based in Ottawa, has already backed CarbonCure*, a technology that takes carbon dioxide and sequesters it in cement.“General\xa0Fusion\xa0has a strong record of attracting funding support from some of the world’s most influential technology leaders,” said Greg Twinney, CFO,\xa0General\xa0Fusion, in a statement.\xa0“Fusion\xa0is planet-saving technology, and we are proud to support the mission of Thistledown Capital in its pursuit for a greener tomorrow.”*This story originally incorrectly described CarbonCure’s technology as a direct air capture variant.']",priced its IPO,"['General Fusion', 'Amazon', 'NavigationClose', 'General Fusion', 'Amazon', 'General Fusion', 'Tobias Lütke', 'Lütke’s Thistledown Capital', 'General Fusion', 'Jeff Bezos', 'Amazon', 'General Fusion', 'Crunchbase', 'General Fusion', 'General Fusion’s', 'MTF', 'the U.S. Naval Research Lab', 'General Fusion’s', 'Michel Laberge', 'General Fusion', 'Commonwealth Fusion Systems', 'Commonwealth Fusion Systems', 'Bob Mumgaard', 'Commonwealth Fusion', 'Commonwealth Fusion', 'General Fusion', 'Commonwealth', 'Breakthrough Energy Ventures', 'Trump', 'the Department of Energy', 'DOE', 'INFUSE', 'the Fusion Industry Association', 'Thistledown Capital', 'Greg Twinney', 'CFO', 'Thistledown Capital', 'CarbonCure’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsTCAmazonBreakthrough Energy VenturesDepartment of Energyfusion', 'General Fusion', 'Amazon', 'General Fusion', 'Tobias Lütke', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

This is the first flight for this particular booster, and for the capsule it carried, which was equipped with a range of new passenger safety, control and comfort systems that Blue Origin was testing during flight for the first time. Also on board was a life-sized test dummy called “Mannequin Skywalker” that recorded information during the flight and landing that the Blue Origin will now review.Based on the video stream and commentary from the company, this looks like a very successful test, including a takeoff, booster separation, controlled landing burn and touchdown — and a parachute-aided landing back on terra firma for the crew capsule. The mission didn’t carry any real passengers, although there were 50,000 postcards on board from school kids globally that have now officially been to space (past the Karman line) which will be returned to those students via Blue Origin’s nonprofit “Club for the Future.”This is essentially what the mission will look like once Blue Origin actually begins to fly paying private astronauts to suborbital space as well; while we don’t have a timeline for when that’ll happen, today’s launch included key tests of a crew alert system that will provide anyone onboard with crucial mission information, as well as a new soft lining on the wall for protection during the weightless portion of the flight, as well as for sound and vibration dampening for the comfort of those on board. This capsule was also equipped with a carbon dioxide scrubber, which will be used to provide safe atmosphere for those within the capsule during the course of the flight.']",Seattle-based Madrona raises $345M for its eighth early-stage fund,"['NavigationClose ScreenBlue Origin', 'CommentBlue Origin', 'New Shepard', 'Blue Origin', 'the Blue Origin', 'Blue Origin’s', 'Blue Origin', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAerospaceSpaceTCBlue', 'New Shepard', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/mC4sdgF6wj,2021-01-14T17:07:00,Thimble teaches kids STEM skills with robotics kits combined with live Zoom classes,"['Parents with kids stuck learning at home during the pandemic have had to look for alternative activities to promote the hands-on learning experiences kids are missing out on due to attending class virtually. The New York-based educational technology startup Thimble aims to help address this problem by offering a subscription service for STEM-based projects that allow kids to make robotics, electronics and other tech using a combination of kits shipped to the home and live online instruction.Thimble began back in 2016 as a Kickstarter project when it raised $300,000 in 45 days to develop its STEM-based robotics and programming kits. The next year, it began selling its kits to schools, largely in New York, for use in the classroom or in after-school programs. Over the years that followed, Thimble scaled its customer base to include around 250 schools across New York, Pennsylvania and California, which would buy the kits and gain access to teacher training.But the COVID-19 pandemic changed the course of Thimble’s business.“A lot of schools were in panic mode. They were not sure what was happening, and so their spending was frozen for some time,” explains Thimble co-founder and CEO Oscar Pedroso, whose background is in education. “Even our top customers that I would call, they would just give [say], ‘hey, this is not a good time. We think we’re going to be closing schools down.”Pedroso realized that the company would have to quickly pivot to begin selling directly to parents instead.Image Credits: ThimbleAround April, it made the shift — effectively entering the B2C market for the first time.The company today offers parents a subscription that allows them to receive up to 15 different STEM-focused project kits and a curriculum that includes live instruction from an educator. One kit is shipped out over the course of three months, though an accelerated program is available that ships with more frequency.The first kit is basic electronics, where kids learn how to build simple circuits, like a doorbell, kitchen timer and a music composer, for example. The kit is designed so kids can experience “quick wins” to keep their attention and whet their appetite for more projects. This leads into future kits like those offering a Wi-Fi robot, a little drone, an LED compass that lights up and a synthesizer that lets kids become their own DJ.Image Credits: ThimbleWhile any family can use the kits to help kids experience hands-on electronics and robotics, Pedroso says that about 70% of subscribers are those where the child already has a knack for doing these sorts of projects. The remaining 30% are those where the parents are looking to introduce the concepts of robotics and programming, to see if the kids show an interest. Around 40% of the students are girls.The subscription is more expensive than some DIY projects at $59.99/per month (or $47.99/mo if paid annually), but this is because it includes live instruction in the form of weekly one-hour Zoom classes. Thimble has part-time employees who are not just able to teach the material, but can do so in a way that appeals to children — by being passionate, energetic and capable of jumping in to help if they sense a child is having an issue or getting frustrated. Two of the five teachers are women. One instructor is bilingual and teaches some classes in Spanish.Why hasn’t digital learning lived up to its promise?During class, one teacher instructs while a second helps moderate the chat room and answer the questions that kids ask.The live classes will have around 15-20 students each, but Thimble additionally offers a package for small groups that reduces class size. These could be used by homeschool “pods” or other groups.Image Credits: Thimble“We started hearing from pods and then micro-schools,” notes Pedroso. “Those were parents who were connected to other parents, and wanted their kids to be part of the same class. They generally required a little bit more attention and wanted some things a little more customized,” he added.These subscriptions are more expensive at $250/month, but the cost is shared among the group of parents, which brings the price down on per-household basis.

https://t.co/G5PmB2uMF8,2021-01-14T17:00:34,Mosaic raises $18.5M Series A from GC to rebuild the CFO software stack,"['CFOs are the supposed omniscient owners of a company. While the CEO sets strategy, messages and builds culture, the CFO needs to know everything that it is going on in an organization. Where is revenue coming from, and when will it arrive? How much will new headcount cost, and when do those expenses need to be paid? How can cash flows be managed, and what debt products might help smooth out any discontinuities?As companies have migrated to the cloud, these questions have gotten harder to answer as other departments started avoiding the ERP as a centralized system-of-record. Worse, CFOs are expected to be more strategic than ever about finance, but can struggle to deliver important forecasts and projections given the lack of availability of key data. CMOs have gotten a whole new software stack to run marketing in the past decade, so why not CFOs?For three Palantir alums, the hope is that CFOs will turn to their new startup called Mosaic. Mosaic is a “strategic finance platform” that is designed to ingest data from all sorts of systems in the alphabet soup of enterprise IT — ERPs, HRISs, CRMs, etc. — and then provide CFOs and their teams with strategic planning tools to be able to predict and forecast with better accuracy and with speed.The company was founded in April 2019 by Bijan Moallemi, Brian Campbell and Joe Garafalo, who worked together at Palantir in the company’s finance team for more than 15 years collectively. While there, they saw the company grow from a small organization with a bit more than one hundred people to an organization with thousands of employees, more than one hundred customers as we saw last year with Palantir’s IPO and incoming revenue from more than a dozen countries.Mosaic founders Bijan Moallemi, Brian Campbell and Joseph Garafalo. Photo via Mosaic.Strategically handling finance was critical for Palantir’s success, but the existing tools in its stack couldn’t keep up with the company’s needs. So Palantir ended up building its own. We were “not just cranking away in Excel, which is really the default tool in the toolkit for CFOs, but actually building a technical team that was writing code, [and] building tools to really give speed, access, trust and visibility across the organization,” Moallemi, who is CEO of Mosaic, described.Most organizations can’t spare their technical talent to the CFO’s office, and so as the three co-founders left Palantir to other pastures as heads of finance — Moallemi to edtech startup Piazza, Campbell to litigation management startup Everlaw and Garafalo to blockchain startup Axoni — they continued to percolate on how finance could be improved. They came together to do for all companies what they saw at Palantir: build a great software foundation for the CFO’s office. “Probably the biggest advancements to the office of the CFO over the last 10 years has been moving from kind of desktop-based Excel to cloud-based Google Sheets,” Moallemi said.Leaked Palantir S-1 shows company has 125 customers after 17 yearsSo what is Mosaic trying to do to rebuild the CFO software stack? It wants to build a platform that is a gateway to connecting the entire company to discuss finance in a more collaborative fashion. So while Mosaic focuses on reporting and planning, the mainstays of the finance office, it wants to open those dashboards and forecasts wider into the company so more people can have insight into what’s going on and also give feedback to the CFO.Screenshot of Mosaic’s planning function. Image via Mosaic.There are a handful of companies like publicly traded Anaplan that have entered this space in the last decade. Moallemi says incumbents have a couple of key challenges that Mosaic hopes to overcome. First is onboarding, which can take months for some of these companies as consultants integrate the software into a company’s workflow. Second is that these tools often require dedicated, full-time staff to stay operational. Third is that these tools are basically non-visible to anyone outside the CFO office. Mosaic wants to be ready to integrate immediately, widely distributed within orgs, and require minimal upkeep to be useful.“Everyone wants to be strategic, but it’s so tough to do because 80% of your time is pulling data from these disparate systems, cleaning it, mapping it, updating your Excel files, and maybe 20% of [your time] is actually taking a step back and understanding what the data is telling you,” Moallemi said.That’s perhaps why its target customers are Series B and C-funded companies, which no doubt have much of their data already located in easily accessible databases. The company started with smaller companies, and, Moallemi said, “We’ve been slowly inching our way up there over the last 12 months or so working with larger, more complex customers.” The company has grown to 30 employees and has revenues in the seven figures (without a sales org, according to Moallemi), although the startup didn’t want to be more specific than that.With all that growth and excitement, the company is attracting investor attention. Today, the company announced that it raised $18.5 million of Series A financing led by Trevor Oelschig of General Catalyst, who has led other enterprise SaaS deals into startups like Fivetran, Contentful and Loom. That round closed at the end of last year.Mosaic previously raised a $2.5 million seed investment led by Ross Fubini of XYZ Ventures in mid-2019, who was formerly an investor at Village Global. Fubini said by email that he was intrigued by the company because the founders had a “shared pain” at Palantir over the state of software for CFOs, and “they had all experienced this deep frustration with the tools they needed to do their jobs.”Other investors in the Series A included Felicis Ventures, plus XYZ and Village Global.Along with the financing, the company also announced the creation of an advisory board that includes the current or former CFOs from nine tech companies, including Palantir, Dropbox and Shopify.Many functions of business have had a complete transformation in software. Now, Mosaic hopes, it’s the CFO’s time.']",Zach Perret,"['CFO', 'NavigationClose', 'CFO', 'Crichton@dannycrichton', 'CFO', 'discontinuities?As', 'ERP', 'Palantir', 'Brian Campbell', 'Joe Garafalo', 'Palantir', 'Palantir’s', 'Brian Campbell', 'Joseph Garafalo', 'Palantir’s', 'Palantir', 'Moallemi', 'CFO', 'Palantir', 'Piazza', 'Campbell', 'Palantir', 'CFO', 'CFO', 'Google Sheets', 'Moallemi', 'Leaked Palantir S-1', 'CFO', 'Anaplan', 'Moallemi', 'CFO', 'Moallemi', 'Moallemi', 'Moallemi', 'Fivetran, Contentful and Loom', 'Ross Fubini', 'XYZ Ventures', 'Fubini', 'Palantir', 'Felicis Ventures', 'XYZ', 'Village Global', 'Palantir', 'Dropbox', 'the CFO’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CatalystmosaicMosaic', 'CFO', 'CFO', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Li has been with Madrona for five years, while Sharma joined the team in 2020. Prior to joining Madrona, Sharma led product management teams at Amazon Web Services, worked as a software developer at Oracle and had a stint in VC as an associate at SoftBank China & India. Li previously worked at the Boston Consulting Group.Seattle-based Madrona raises $345M for its eighth early-stage fundI got the chance to catch up with Li, who notes that the promotion won’t necessarily mean a big shift in his day-to-day responsibilities — “At Madrona, you’re not promoted until you’re working in the next role anyway,” he says — but that he appreciates “how much trust the firm places in junior investors.”Asked about leveling up his venture career during a time when public and private markets seem particularly flush with cash, Li acknowledges some looming challenges.“On one hand, it’s just been an amazing five years to join venture capital because things have just been up and to the right with lots of things that work; it’s just a super exciting time,” Li says. “On the other hand, from a macro perspective, you know that there’s more capital flowing into VC as an asset class than ever before. And just from that pure macro perspective, you know that that means returns are going to be lower in the next 10 years as valuations are higher.”Nevertheless, Li is plenty bullish on internet companies claiming larger swaths of the global GDP and hopes to invest specifically in “low code platforms, next-gen productivity, and online communities,” Madrona notes in their announcement, while Sharma plans to continue looking at to “distributed systems, data infrastructure, machine learning, and security.”TechCrunch recently talked to Li and his Madrona colleague Hope Cochran about some of the top trends in social gaming and how investors were approaching new opportunities across the gaming industry.8 investors discuss social gaming’s biggest opportunities']",Harness,"['Madrona', 'Anu Sharma', 'Daniel Li', 'NavigationClose ScreenMadrona', 'Anu Sharma', 'Daniel Li', 'Madrona Venture Group', 'Anu Sharma', 'Daniel Li', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Li', 'Partner', 'Li', 'Madrona', 'Madrona', 'Sharma', 'Amazon Web Services', 'Oracle', 'VC', 'SoftBank China & India', 'Li', 'the Boston Consulting Group', 'Madrona', 'Li', 'Madrona', 'Li', 'Li', 'VC', 'Li', 'Madrona', 'Li', 'Madrona', 'Cochran', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'CapitalAmazon', 'Anu Sharma', 'Daniel Li', 'Madrona Venture Group', 'Anu Sharma', 'Daniel Li', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/EJDq3RFSzU,2021-01-14T16:31:53,Tech and health companies including Microsoft and Salesforce team up on digital COVID-19 vaccination records,"['A new cross-industry initiative is seeking to establish a standard for digital vaccination records that can be used universally to identify COVID-19 vaccination status for individuals, in a way that can be both secure via encryption and traceable and verifiable for trustworthiness regarding their contents. The so-called “Vaccination Credential Initiative” includes a range of big-name companies from both the healthcare and the tech industry, including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and Epic, as well as the Mayo Clinic, Safe Health, Change Healthcare and the CARIN Alliance to name a few.The effort is beginning with existing, recognized standards already in use in digital healthcare programs, like the SMART Health Cards specification, which adheres to HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) which is a standard created for use in digital health records to make them interoperable between providers. The final product that the initiative aims to establish is an “encrypted digital copy of their immunization credentials to store in a digital wallet of their choice,” with a backup available as a printed QR code that includes W3C-standards verifiable credentials for individuals who don’t own or prefer not to use smartphones.Vaccination credentials aren’t a new thing — they’ve existed in some form or another since the 1700s. But their use and history is also mired in controversy and accusations of inequity, since this is human beings we’re dealing with. And already with COVID-19, there are efforts underway to make access to certain geographies dependent upon negative COVID-19 test results (though such results don’t actually guarantee that an individual doesn’t actually have COVID-19 or won’t transfer it to others).A recent initiative by LA County specifically also is already providing digital immunization records to individuals via a partnership with Healthvana, facilitated by Apple’s Wallet technology. But Healthvana’s CEO and founder was explicit in telling me that that isn’t about providing a proof of immunity for use in deterring an individual’s social or geographic access. Instead, it’s about informing and supporting patients for optimal care outcomes.Healthvana’s digital COVID-19 vaccination records are about communication, not passports for the immuneIt sounds like this initiative is much more about using a COVID-19 immunization record as a literal passport of sorts. It’s right in the name of the initiative, for once (“Credential” is pretty explicit). The companies involved also at least seem cognizant of the potential pitfalls of such a program, as MITRE’s chief digital health physician Dr. Brian Anderson said that “we are working to ensure that underserved populations have access to this verification,” and added that “just as COVID-19 does not discriminate based on socio-economic status, we must ensure that convenient access to records crosses the digital divide.”Other quotes from Oracle and Salesforce, and additional member leaders, confirm that the effort is focused on fostering a reopening of social and economic activity, including “resuming travel,” get[ting] back to public life,” and “get[ting] concerts and sporting events going again.” Safe Health also says that they’ll help facilitate a “privacy-preserving health status verification” solution that is at least in part “blockchain-enabled.”Given the urgency of solutions that can lead to a safe re-opening, and a way to keep tabs on the massive, global vaccination program that’s already underway, it makes sense that a modern approach would include a digital version of historic vaccination record systems. But such an approach, while it leverages new conveniences and modes made possible by smartphones and the internet, also opens itself up to new potential pitfalls and risks that will no doubt be highly scrutinized, particularly by public interest groups focused on privacy and equitable treatment.']",,"['Microsoft', 'TechCrunchOpen NavigationClose ScreenTech', 'Microsoft', 'Etherington@etherington', 'Dogukan Keskinkilic', 'Microsoft', 'Oracle, Salesforce and Epic', 'the Mayo Clinic', 'the CARIN Alliance', 'the SMART Health Cards', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19', 'Healthvana', 'Apple’s Wallet', 'Healthvana', 'Healthvana', 'Brian Anderson', 'COVID-19', 'Oracle and Salesforce', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsHealthTCencryptionepicHealthvanaMayo ClinicMicrosoftoracleregulationSalesforcesmartphonesstandardsTech', 'Microsoft', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Then it failed to close, eventually running into a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. A few months later, the acquisition was dropped.Sentiment in the market changed since the transaction was announced. As TechCrunch reported yesterday, there’s a good deal of optimism to be found amongst investors and others that Plaid will eventually be worth more than the price at which the Visa deal valued it.What follows is a summary of our conversation with Perret, digging into a number of topics we felt most were pressing in the wake of Plaid’s unshackling.Now what?First and upfront: It does not appear that Plaid is racing to the public markets via a blank-check company, or SPAC, a question several readers asked on Twitter.

The change has been mischaracterized by many as their personal communication being compromised, which WhatsApp clarified this week was not the case.The Facebook-owned service, which serves over 2 billion users worldwide, said private conversations between people remain just as private as before. Facebook has also bought front-page newspaper ads in several leading Indian dailies this week to explain the change, which it first outlined last year.The petitioner said the new terms grant WhatsApp a “360-degree profile into a person’s online activity” without any “government oversight.”“WhatsApp has made a mockery out of our fundamental right to privacy while discharging a public function in India, besides jeopardizing the National Security of the country by sharing, transmitting and storing the users data in some [other] country and that data, in turn, will be governed by the laws of that foreign country,” the petition, which is expected to be heard Friday, reads.Several high-profile startup founders and executives in India have also criticized WhatsApp’s new data-sharing policy.

For a company that launched just three years ago, this is a fairly remarkable trajectory.Alkeon Capital led the round with help from new investors Battery Ventures, Citi Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Sorenson Capital and Thomvest Ventures. The startup also revealed a previously unannounced $30 million B-1 round raised after the $60 million round, bringing the total raised to date to $195 million.Company founder and CEO Jyoti Bansal previously founded AppDynamics, which he sold to Cisco in 2017 for $3.7 billion. With his track record, investors came looking for him this round. It didn’t hurt that revenue grew almost 3x last year.“The business is doing very well, so the investor community has been proactively reaching out and trying to invest in us. We were not actually planning to raise a round until later this year. We had enough capital to get through that, but there were a lot of people wanting to invest,” Bansal told me.In fact, he said there is so much investor interest that he could have raised twice as much, but didn’t feel a need to take on that much capital at this time. “Overall, the investor community sees the value in developer tools and the DevOps market. There are so many big public companies now in that space that have gone out in the last three to five years and that has definitely created even more validation of this space,” he said.Bansal says that he started the company with the goal of making every company as good as Google or Facebook when it comes to engineering efficiency. Since most companies lack the engineering resources of these large companies, that’s a tall task, but one he thinks he can solve through software.The company started by building a continuous delivery module. A cloud cost-efficiency module followed. Last year the company bought open-source continuous integration company Drone.io and they are working on building that into the platform now, with it currently in beta. There are additional modules on the product roadmap coming this year, according to Bansal.Harness makes first acquisition, snagging open-source CI company Drone.ioAs the company continued to grow revenue and build out the platform in 2020, it also added a slew of new employees, growing from 200 to 300 during the pandemic. Bansal says that he has plans to add another 200 by the end of this year. Harness has a reputation of being a good place to work, recently landing on Glassdoor’s best companies list.As an experienced entrepreneur, Bansal takes building a diverse company with a welcoming culture very seriously. “Yes, you have to provide equal opportunity and make sure that you are open to hiring people from diverse backgrounds, but you have to be more proactive about it in the sense that you have to make sure that your company environment and company culture feels very welcoming to everyone,” he said.It’s been a difficult time building a company during the pandemic, adding so many new employees, and finding a way to make everyone feel welcome and included. Bansal says he has actually seen productivity increase during the pandemic, but now has to guard against employee burnout.He says that people didn’t know how to draw boundaries when working at home.

With Mobile World Congress pushed back six or so months, the hardware maker hitched its wagon to the tail end of the CES whirlwind — though unlike its press conference earlier in the week, the company is very much on its own for the latest Unpacked.And why not? In spite of broader issues with the mobile industry (certainly not helped by the COVID-19 pandemic), the Galaxy line is still very much a draw. People may not be as eager to buy a flagship as they were a couple of years ago, but when they do, it’s frequently a Samsung device.I tend to save pricing for the end of these kinds of posts, but it really bears mention up front. Samsung’s launching three key iterations of the S21 line today: the S21, S21+ and S21 Ultra. Those are priced at $799, $999 and $1,119 respectively, here in the States. That’s down from $999, $1,199 and $1,399 last year. While it’s true we’re still very much in the flagship price range here, a $200 drop is not insignificant.Image Credits: SamsungRather, it points to a very conscious correction — one that goes beyond simply introducing a budget flagship or flagship lite to appease that segment of the market. Smartphone sales were already lagging before the pandemic, and the routine pricing of flagships above $1,000 was a considerable piece of that. Obviously the pandemic has only exacerbated the situation for myriad reasons, and 5G, which was expected to lead to a sales rebound didn’t move the needle nearly as much as anticipated.Of course, 5G was a headliner feature for Samsung all the way back in 2019. The company has been all-in with the Galaxy line for a while now, and frankly, the feature is just kind of expected now. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Samsung is going back to imaging as a key differentiator.Here’s what Mobile head TM Roh has to say about the new handsets:We are living in a mobile-first world, and with so many of us working remotely and spending more time at home, we wanted to deliver a smartphone experience that meets the rigorous multimedia demands of our continuously changing routines. We also recognize the importance of choice, especially now, and that’s why the Galaxy S21 series gives you the freedom to choose the best device for your style and needs.I absolutely understand why companies continue to go the “in these challenging times” route with these announcements, though I will say that, for the most part, the notion of device upgrades as a response to COVID-19 is really overstated here, beyond the aforementioned price drop. And I suspect that, with fewer people leaving the house these days, the dream of a smartphone as a primary productivity device has probably dampened of late.Image Credits: SamsungStill, the S21 Ultra, in particular, has one very important trick up its sleeve.

The experience will vary to some degree, but users will be able to use the stylus to write and draw on the handset. It’s sold separately and there’s no in-device housing for the pen, though Samsung will be offering a case that will hold it. It will be interesting to see if the company goes out of its way to distinguish the new Note, but it seems equally possible that the lines are simply converging. After all, the S Pen has long been the key distinguishing factor.The devices also get Ultra-wideband capabilities, which will bring a number of capabilities, including the ability to unlock car doors and AR messages to find lost items. More detail on that soon, no doubt.Visually, the biggest change here is the camera housing, which gets streamlined. I’m holding off judgement until I see it in person, but the new “Contour Cut” housing feels a bit more brutalist or perhaps industrial than the prior generation.

The Ultra bumps that up to a 12-megapixel ultra-wide, 108-megapixel wide and a dual-telephoto lens system with 3x and 10x optical zoom.

https://t.co/JZqJgju1Te,2021-01-14T15:00:06,"Samsung unveils its newest Tile competitor, the Galaxy SmartTag","['Alongside its other CES announcements, at Samsung’s Unpacked event today the company introduced its new Galaxy SmartTag Bluetooth locator, a lost item beacon for Samsung owners and a competitor with Tile. Like Tile and Apple’s forthcoming AirTags, the beacon can be attached to keys, a bag, a pet’s collar or anything else you want to track. Initially, these SmartTags will use Bluetooth to communicate with a nearby Samsung device, however, the company confirmed an ultra-wideband (UWB) powered version called the SmartTag+ will arrive later this year.The latter would allow the SmartTag to better compete with Apple’s AirTags, which are also expected to take advantage of newer iPhones’ UWB capabilities. Tile, in anticipation of this news, has already developed\xa0a UWB tracker arriving later this year, as well.The SmartTag announced today, the Galaxy SmartTag, will use Bluetooth and there is only one main SKU — not a range of products in different sizes or configurations. However, the tracker will be sold in two color variations: Black and Oatmeal.The tracker works with any Galaxy device, a Samsung rep told us, as long as the device runs Android 10 or later.Device owners can then locate the missing item with the SmartTag attached using the SmartThings Find app.Tile to launch a new tracker powered by ultra-wideband technology, add AR finding to appThis works similar to Tile and other BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) trackers. When the SmartTag is offline — meaning, disconnected from the Galaxy S21 or other device — it sends a BLE signal that can be detected by nearby Galaxy devices. When detected, the device will send the nearby location information to the SmartThings Fine app so you can locate the item. Samsung says the SmartThings Find user data is encrypted and securely protected, so your location and personal information is safe when you lose your device and use the app to search for it.The app will also offer a variety of locating tools, including a “Notify me when it’s found” option, as well as “Search Nearby,” “Search” and “Ring” tools. Like Tile, you can also use a SmartTag to locate a missing phone. In this case, you push the Galaxy SmartTag button twice to receive an alert to help locate the missing phone.The tag can also be customized to do other things when pushed once, so you could easily turn on your lights or TV when you return home, for example.Ahead of the announcement, regulatory documents showed the tracker as a slightly chunkier version of Tile’s trackers, powered by a CR2032 cell battery, with Bluetooth connectivity. (We’ve confirmed the battery is, in fact, a user-replaceable CR2032.)A Samsung rep could not provide us with the official and detailed tech specs for the device ahead of its announcement today, but we’ll update if the company figures it out. Unfortunately, without the confirmed details like whether the battery is user-replaceable, for example, or what the range is, it’s difficult to make a proper comparison to the existing trackers on the market. (You can’t always go off leaks alone here, either, as they aren’t always an indication of the final product. But the regulatory filings are likely a good starting point.)To promote adoption, Samsung is giving away the new trackers via select pre-orders. From January 14-28, 2021, consumers who pre-order the Galaxy S21 Ultra will get a $200 Samsung Credit plus a free Galaxy SmartTag. That could help the devices gain a little more traction, as Samsung’s previous investments in tracking gadgets, including its 2018 LTE-based SmartThings tracking fobs, never really caught on.Outside the pre-order promotion, the SmartTags will cost $29.99 individually and will be sold starting January 29th.This is slightly steeper than Tile’s entry-level Bluetooth tracker, the Tile Mate, which retails for $24.99.']",Google this morning announced,"['Samsung', 'NavigationClose', 'Samsung’s Unpacked', 'Samsung', 'Apple’s', 'AirTags', 'SmartTags', 'Samsung', 'UWB', 'SmartTag', 'Apple’s AirTags', 'iPhones', 'UWB', 'UWB', 'SmartTag', 'Oatmeal', 'Samsung', 'SmartTag', 'AR', 'SmartTag', 'the SmartThings Fine', 'Samsung', 'SmartTag', 'Tile’s', 'Samsung', 'Samsung', 'the Galaxy S21 Ultra', 'Samsung', 'LTE', 'SmartThings', 'SmartTags', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Samsung’s Unpacked', 'Samsung', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

It was a given that the company was planning to deliver its own take on Apple’s AirPods Pro, with improved sound quality and active noise canceling. The real secret weapon here, however, may be the price.This morning’s S21 announcement found Samsung dropping $200 off the price of its flagship smartphone, and here the Galaxy Buds come in at $50 cheaper than the AirPods’ asking price. It’s not clearance-bin pricing exactly, but $199 is a pretty reasonable starting price. And Samsung’s earbud track record is a pretty good indication that the headphones will be solid.The buds get a stated five hours of on-board battery life. That bumps up to eight hours with active noise canceling and Bixby Voice off — one of those things I can fairly easily live without. The case bumps things up to 18 and 28 hours, respectively. Pretty impressive claims for a quite small case.Image Credits: SamsungThe buds’ design improves on the Galaxy Buds Live’s bean design, trading it for something a bit more ergonomic that’s designed to reduce the contact area between the device and the ear. Per Samsung’s claims, the ANC is capable of reducing ambient sound up to 99%. You can tweak the settings from there. They sport an 11 mm woofer and 6.5 mm tweeter, along with three microphones for calls.There are a couple of features specifically for Samsung devices, including auto switching between phones and tablets, as well as Dolby head tracking and microphone capabilities for video recording on the Galaxy S21.The buds are available in three colors and go up for order today.

https://t.co/lOpRD6FVgN,2021-01-14T14:38:27,E2E encrypted email providers also see sign-ups surge as chat app users flock to Signal and Telegram in search of privacy,"[""Privacy concerns that have been driving app users to alternative chat apps like Signal and Telegram in recent weeks, since Facebook-owned WhatsApp announced a T&Cs change, appear to also be generating some uplift for end-to-end encrypted email providers.Two Europe-based email providers, ProtonMail and Tutanota, have reported an uptick in sign-ups in recent weeks.ProtonMail founder Andy Yen told TechCrunch it’s seen a 3x rise in sign-ups for its end-to-end encrypted webmail service “in recent weeks.” While Germany’s Tutanota said usage has doubled since privacy concerns about WhatsApp’s new T&Cs sharing data with Facebook started circulating online.“We are thrilled to see so many new users coming in. We already said in 2017 that the privacy era has started, and we have been proven right ever since. People around the world are increasingly understanding that privacy matters and are no longer okay with fueling the surveillance capitalism and the exploitation of their data by big tech such as Facebook. That’s why alternatives like Signal and Tutanota are constantly growing,” said Tutanota co-founder Matthias Pfau in a statement.The fully E2E encrypted chat app Signal hasn’t disclosed how many new users it’s racked up in recent weeks but WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton — who joined forces with Signal after he left Facebook in 2018 — told us earlier this week that usage has “exploded.”How it started vs how it's going  pic.twitter.com/ERiFpZUz6c— Signal (@signalapp) January 14, 2021Anecdotal reports of newbies to the app — whose tagline is “say ‘hello’ to privacy” — abound.In my case, among the U.K. contacts joining what had previously been a tight clique of privacy nerds, I can report a couple of ex-London neighbours, an old university acquaintance, an antique Tinder date, my former landlord and two three ex-colleagues — while my India-based TC colleague, Manish Singh, showed me three full screenshots of sign-ups his Signal app had alerted him to in just “the last few days.”Signal’s Brian Acton talks about exploding growth, monetization and WhatsApp data-sharing outrageTelegram, another long-standing WhatsApp chat app alternative, has also reported a huge influx of new users in recent weeks.The platform offers end-to-end encryption as an option for one-to-one chats (via its “Secret Chats” feature), although unlike Signal E2E encryption is not the default rule. Nonetheless its founder, Pavel Durov, has been a very vocal critic of how Facebook treats users and their data. And that reputation baiting looks to be paying off.“I hear Facebook has an entire department devoted to figuring out why Telegram is so popular,” Durov wrote in his Telegram Channel on January 8, seeking to capitalize on concerns about the looming WhatsApp’s T&Cs change. “Imagine dozens of employees working on just that full time.“I am happy to save Facebook tens of millions of dollars and give away our secret for free: Respect your users,” he added.Telegram, nearing 500 million users, to begin monetizing the appA few days later Durov posted again to report Telegram’s user-base had surpassed 500 million monthly actives in the first week of this year — adding 25 million new users “in the last 72 hours alone.”“These new users came from across the globe — 38% from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA,” he went on, implying around 6% of the new sign-ups came from North America (where there have also been reports of Trump supporters turning to Telegram as an alternative channel to organize protests as mainstream social networks have closed down accounts and pages linked to threats of violence and insurrection).“This is a significant increase compared to last year, when 1.5 million new users signed up every day,” he said, adding: “We’ve had surges of downloads before, throughout our seven-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services. They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users.”Durov has posted another update today — saying sign-ups have “only accelerated” (and welcoming a couple more heads of state to the platform).The privacy-flavored mass migration of users to WhatsApp alternatives has pushed the Facebook-owned company to attempt a public firefight this week — over what it couches as “rumours” about the looming T&Cs changes.We want to address some rumors and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption. pic.twitter.com/6qDnzQ98MP— WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) January 12, 2021A Facebook spokesperson told us there are no changes to WhatsApp’s data-sharing practices anywhere in the world with this update — which they said is about providing clearer, more detailed information to users on how and why the company uses their data and also provides information about how businesses can use WhatsApp to connect with their customers.But Facebook’s problem is it has spent 15+ years torching user trust around privacy. And all those broken promises are coming home to roost as users fly elsewhere — searching for a platform whose business model isn’t predicated on exploiting their attention.Whatever the specific detail of the latest WhatsApp T&Cs change, there’s no escaping the ugly truth that Facebook is an adtech giant. And it did already screw over WhatsApp users’ privacy — when it U-turned on data-sharing with Facebook just a few short years after it shelled out $19 billion to line up all those extra eyeballs for its surveillance business. That’s why E2E encryption in the hands of Mark Zuckerberg’s advertising empire simply can’t protect users’ privacy in the same way that a not-for-profit app like Signal can. And all those “personalized” Facebook features — be they stickers, filters, lenses or whatever — are just a distraction from the underlying truth that Facebook makes money by removing users’ privacy through an interconnected mesh of apps and tools that are dedicated to tracking internet users and linking digital activity to eyeballs. The techie obscurity that cloaked Facebook’s surveillance for years is now steadily being unpicked. And it’s clear that plenty of people don’t at all like what they see.\xa0Data linked to you..

Google’s use of the vast amount of user health data has long been the key sticking point of regulatory concern of the deal.

We worked with global regulators on an approach which safeguards consumers’ privacy expectations, including a series of binding commitments that confirm Fitbit users’ health and wellness data won’t be used for Google ads and this data will be separated from other Google ads data.We’ll also maintain access to Android APIs that enable devices like fitness trackers and smart watches to interoperate with Android smartphones, and we’ll continue to allow Fitbit users to choose to connect to third-party services so you’ll still be able to sync your favorite health and fitness apps to your Fitbit account. These commitments will be implemented globally so that all consumers can benefit from them. We’ll also continue to work with regulators around the world so that they can be assured that we are living up to these commitments.Fitbit co-founder and CEO James Park echoed the sentiment, writing:The trust of our users will continue to be paramount, and we will maintain strong data privacy and security protections, giving you control of your data and staying transparent about what we collect and why. Google will continue to protect Fitbit users’ privacy and has made a series of binding commitments with global regulators, confirming that Fitbit users’ health and wellness data won’t be used for Google ads and this data will be kept separate from other Google ad data. Google also affirmed it will continue to allow Fitbit users to choose to connect to third party services.The levels and intimacy of data collected by these sorts of consumer devices has increased significantly over the past decade. Adding fuel to that fire is the push from companies like Fitbit and Apple to have their products taken more seriously as medical devices — or at least medically adjacent. Both companies have commissioned health studies, sought FDA clearance and worked with insurance companies. This push will no doubt only intensify.The $2.1 billion deal’s completion comes with a number of concessions. The EU in particular presented a number of caveats when it finally greenlit the acquisition last month. It noted at the time, “The commitments will determine how Google can use the data collected for ad purposes, how interoperability between competing wearables and Android will be safeguarded and how users can continue to share health and fitness data, if they choose to.”As part of the deal, Google agreed to not use Fitbit data for ads for 10 years — which the Commission reserved the rights to extend by another 10 years. Google also agreed to maintain third-party developer access to Android APIs, in order to maintain some competition.Founded in 2007, Fitbit became synonymous with the wearable fitness tracker space. Ultimately, however, the company struggled to maintain dominance with the arrival of the smartwatch, eventually ceding significant market share to the Apple Watch. The company eventually made headway in the category with devices like the Versa, but by then it was seemingly too late to continue on its own.The deal certainly makes sense for Google, given its continued struggles to make a dent with Android Wear/Wear OS. With Fitbit, the company’s getting an established hardware maker. It’s not entirely dissimilar from its purchase of HTC assets to help grow the Pixel line of phones, though there’s still enough cache in the Fitbit brand to keep it alive. Notably, Fitbit’s own growth in the smartwatch space was spurred on by several of its own acquisitions, including smartwatch pioneer and crowdfunding darling Pebble.In late 2019, Google also acquired Timex smartwatch technology for $40 million, making it extremely likely that the company will be taking on the Apple Watch directly. Understandably so, the product has not only been a massive hit for Apple, it’s opened the door to all sorts of health offerings, including the recently launched Fitness+. If this year’s CES proved anything, it’s that home workouts are a huge business with lots of upside, with even Samsung getting into the act.Companies rush to replace the gym at CESUpdate: The U.S. Department of Justice has issued a clarifying comment, noting that an investigation is ongoing:The Antitrust Division’s investigation of Google’s acquisition of Fitbit remains ongoing. Although the Division has not reached a final decision about whether to pursue an enforcement action, the Division continues to investigate whether Google’s acquisition of Fitbit may harm competition and consumers in the United States. The Division remains committed to conducting this review as thoroughly, efficiently, and expeditiously as possible.”Google is acquiring Fitbit for $2.1 billion']",Lumiata,"['NavigationClose ScreenGoogle’s', 'Fitbit', 'Google’s', 'Apple', 'adsGoogle SVP', 'Rick Osterloh', 'Android', 'Android', 'Fitbit', 'James Park', 'Fitbit', 'Apple', 'FDA', 'EU', 'Android', 'Google', 'Commission', 'Android', 'the Apple Watch', 'Versa', 'Android Wear/Wear OS', 'Fitbit', 'Fitbit’s', 'Pebble', 'Google', 'Timex', 'the Apple Watch', 'Apple', 'CES', 'Samsung', 'The U.S. Department of Justice', 'The Antitrust Division’s', 'Google’s', 'Division', 'Division', 'Google’s', 'Fitbit', 'Division', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'AcquisitionsGoogle’s Fitbit', 'Heater3:20 PM', 'Fitbit', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/BhnELAcc0X,2021-01-14T14:16:01,Carbyne raises $25M for a next-generation platform to improve emergency 911 responses,"['Emergency services continue to be a major force when it comes to coping with the COVID-19 health pandemic, and today a company that is building technology to help them run better is announcing a round of funding to continue expanding its business.Carbyne — an Israeli startup that has built a cloud-based platform aimed at emergency services to help them pinpoint more complete information about the people who are calling in, and to provide additional telemedicine services to start responding faster — has picked up $25 million.The plan will be to take the service — which was already seeing strong growth before the pandemic — to the next level in terms of the technology it is building and the markets and organizations it is serving.“Carbyne was not founded last year: We were already pushing cloud services and video and location to 911 for quite a while and had served 250 million people before the pandemic,” said Amir Elichai, the CEO, in an interview. “But cloud solutions for emergency services went from nice-to-have to must-have with COVID.”The company has partnerships with public health providers as well as with groups like\xa0CentralSquare and Global Medical Response (GMR), and says that in the U.S. it is on target to cover some 90% of the market.The Series B1 is being led by Hanaco Ventures and ELSTED Capital Partners, with former CIA Director General David Petraeus, Founders Fund, FinTLV and other past investors also participating.The fact that this is a B1 round points to more funding on the way for the company in coming months. In any case, the $25 million is more than the company had planned to raise.“The plan was to raise $15 million in 2020. After COVID started I decided we didn’t want to let anyone go, but we didn’t know what the situation would be. So we cut salaries instead across the board,” said Elichai. “But then we started to double revenues starting in Q2, and then in Q3 and Q4 grew 160%. It was straightforward to raise this money.”The funding is coming on the heels of very strong growth for the company, in particular in the last year.Carbyne’s services now cover about 400 million people, with a new implementation launching every 10 days since March of last year.Elichai — who co-founded the company with Alex Dizengoff (CTO), Yony Yatsun (engineering lead) and Lital Lesham (a shareholder) — said in an interview that in the last nine months, Carbyne has provided some 155 million location points to emergency medical services teams. Newer products are also growing. The services for EMS teams to provide help remotely have racked up 1.3 million minutes of video in that time, he said.From what we understand, the funding puts Carbyne’s valuation at “over $100 million.” Although Elichai declined to give a specific figure, for some context, the company was valued at “around” $100 million when it last raised in 2018, a $15 million round that marked the first time that Founders Fund had invested in an Israeli startup.The growth of the last year, and the ongoing demands on the business, point to that “over” being strong. Indeed, since its last round, the world at large, and the startup itself, have undergone some significant changes.Carbyne raises $15M for its next-gen 911 service, as Founders Fund invests in its first Israeli startup2018 and whatever dramas we were experiencing back then now feel like a distant, almost halcyon?, past when compared to some of the crises of the moment. One in particular, the coronavirus pandemic, has a direct connection to Carbyne.COVID-19, the illness the results from the virus, has proven to be a pernicious and dogged ailment, often hitting people with its most dire and serious symptoms — the inability to breathe and organ failure — just when they start to think that they might be recovering. (Of course, that’s not the case for everyone, thankfully, but still it happens much too often to ignore.)That has put a huge strain on emergency response services, from those that are fielding initial callouts, through to those making first contact with patients, and those at the hospitals bringing in and caring for the most serious cases. In many cases, those working these services have been stretched to overcapacity. The situation in many cities is nothing short of dire.Carbyne’s technology has come into its own as a way not just to help those people do their jobs better by providing them with more data, but by becoming a means to those services channeling data back to those people calling in.In the last couple of years, the startup has undergone some significant shifts in how it delivers its services.When I covered the startup’s last funding round in 2018, for example, it provided some services directly to EMS organizations, but mainly it needed users to install an app, or provide that technology through another app, in order to work.Now, Elichai says that the company has integrated some location services from companies like Google to remove the need to use an app to connect users to its platform.Similarly, the startup has taken a strong lead in how it collaborates with municipalities not just to provide services to make their operations more efficient, but to help offset them from getting overwhelmed.A project in that vein was a recent undertaking in New Orleans, which Elichai said played a part in helping the city from really buckling under and managing the COVID-19 outbreak. More on that here:Longer term, in countries like the U.S. and elsewhere, there is a strong argument to be made for a lot of legacy services in 911-style emergency response finally getting the updates they have needed for years.Specifically, earlier this month, a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill approved in Congress earmarks $12 billion in funding for next-generation 911 deployments.Carbyne believes that by 2023, it will be serving some 1.5 billion people, and it’s moves like this in the U.S. that point to why that might not be so far-fetched, COVID-19 or not.“The ability to create transparent emergency communications between citizens, emergency call centers, first responders, and state and local government entities will prove of enormous importance as it is integrated into emergency response systems and will certainly save lives and improve outcomes,” said General Petraeus in a statement. “What Carbyne provides will dramatically enhance communications in the moments that matter most.”']",Gemini,"['NavigationClose ScreenCarbyne', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Getty ImagesEmergency', 'Amir Elichai', 'Global Medical Response', 'GMR', 'Hanaco Ventures', 'ELSTED Capital Partners', 'CIA', 'David Petraeus', 'Founders Fund', 'Elichai', 'Alex Dizengoff', 'CTO', 'Yony Yatsun', 'Lital Lesham', 'Carbyne', 'EMS', 'Carbyne', 'Elichai', 'Founders Fund', 'Founders Fund', 'COVID-19', 'EMS', 'Elichai', 'Elichai', 'COVID-19', 'Congress', 'COVID-19', 'General Petraeus', 'Carbyne', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Lunden3:16 PM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The company is building a credit card that sets limits based on your current and future income, not your credit score.Spark Capital is leading the round with Jared Leto, Aaron Levie, Jeremy Stoppelman, Max Levchin and Ali Rowghani also participating. American Express veteran Ash Gupta is also joining the company as an advisor — he was the chief risk officer of American Express.The company says that it has attracted nearly 300,000 signups on its waitlist. I covered X1 Card back in September and it attracted a lot of readers, so that number doesn’t surprise me.The X1 Card is a stainless steel Visa credit card with a different origin story. When you apply for a card, instead of determining your limits based on your credit score, the company wants to see your current and future income.The startup believes the credit score system is outdated and doesn’t reflect your creditworthiness. That’s why it doesn’t use it to calculate limits. Your credit score still affects your variable APR (from 12.9% to 19.9%), but that’s it.There are also a lot of software features that work with the credit card. For instance, you can track your subscriptions from the X1 app, you can also generate an auto-expiring virtual card for free trials that require a credit card. You also get notifications for refunds.As for rewards, you get 2X points on all purchases. If you’re a heavy user and you spend more than $15,000 on your card per year, you’re upgraded to a new tier and earn 3X points. There’s also a viral element as you get a boosted reward level when you refer a friend —\xa0you get 4X points for a month. You can then spend your points with retail partners.The company has promised a lot of features and now has enough cash in its bank account to deliver.

The report has been punningly titled ‘You can log out, but you can never leave‘.“It should be as easy to end a subscription as it was to subscribe in the first place. Amazon should facilitate a good user experience instead of hindering customers and tricking them into continuing paid services they do not need or want,” said NCC director of digital policy, Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad, in a statement.“In our view, this practice not only betrays the expectations and trust of consumers but breaches European law,” he added.The Prime subscription is a key tool in Amazon’s arsenal, generating reliably recurring revenue while simultaneously encouraging users to lock themselves in to making additional purchases via the carrot of unlimited ‘free’ fast shipping (which applies to a subset of qualifying items on the marketplace). Other perks Amazon throws in to juice Prime membership include streaming movies, TV shows, music and games, plus exclusive shopping programs and discounts (though the exact bundle varies by market).\xa0\xa0However a lock-in vibe also applies when trying to end a Prime subscription, per the complaints, because Amazon requires users to successfully navigate multiple menus, select from confusingly worded multiple-choice options and scroll past various distracting and/or irrelevant interstitials and dead space in order to locate the button that actually ends their subscription.\xa0\xa0And, don’t forget, this is the same company that famously patented a ‘1-click’ button for consumers’ cash to pour into its coffers…The NCC has made the below video illustrating the various dark patterns Amazon deploys to try to nudge Prime subscribers away from unsubscribing — including a cartoon of a dog barking because, uh, we have no idea tbh…Complaints against Amazon’s click-heavy process for Prime unsubscribing are being filed by consumer groups in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Switzerland and Norway and the US — so a variety of national and regional consumer protection laws are involved.The NCC’s complaint, for example, makes reference to Norway’s Marketing Control Act — which implements the EU’s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive — providing a framework for “what marketing, commercial practices and terms of service the service providers are allowed to use in different markets”, as it explains in the complaint.“The Marketing Control Act section 6 implements the general clause in Article 5 of the Directive which states that an unfair commercial practice is banned. What constitutes an unfair commercial practice is defined in the second paragraph of section 6, which states that a commercial practice is unfair if it breaches ‘good business practices’ toward consumers, and is able to significantly alter a consumer’s financial conduct, so that the consumer makes a decision that they would not otherwise have made,” the NCC argues.Some of the coordinated complaints will be less formal, taking the form of letters written to consumer protection agencies urging them to investigate. In the US, for example, the FTC will be urged to “investigate Amazon’s practices and analyze whether they violate Section 5 of the FTC Act”.While in Germany the VZBV consumer protection agency told us it’s currently assessing Amazon’s cancellation process for Prime — which it noted “looks a bit different” to the one in the Norwegian complaints — saying it’s not yet clear whether or not it will file a court injunction over the issue.“Unlike the other consumer organisations taking part in this concerted action, we’re not sending complaints to authorities,” the VZBV spokesperson added. “My employer, the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv) is able to send legal warnings and, if demands to cease and desist are not being met, sue companies infringing consumer protection laws in its own capacity. We will do so if there is enough legal merit to this case. But as I said, it is not completely decided yet.”We contacted Amazon for comment on the complaints against the Prime unsubscribe process and it denied making it unclear and difficult for members to cancel their subscription, arguing that it only takes “a few clicks” online or “a quick phone call”.Here’s its full statement:Amazon makes it clear and easy for Prime members to cancel their subscription at any time, whether through a few clicks online, a quick phone call or by turning off auto renew in their membership options. Customer trust is at the heart of all of our products and services and we reject the claim that our cancellation process is unfair or creates uncertainty. We take great pride in the Prime service and the number of ways it makes our members lives easier, but we make it easy for customers to leave whenever they choose to. The information we provide in the online cancellation flow gives a full view of the benefits and services members are cancelling.Consumer groups banding together to apply pressure on tech giants to change dubious practices is not a new phenomenon.\xa0Back in 2018, for example, a number of European groups coordinated complaints against Google’s ‘deceptive’ harvesting of location data. Just under a year ago the Irish Data Protection Commission opened a formal investigation — which remains ongoing.WTF is dark pattern design?']",Sennder,"['Amazon', 'NavigationClose', 'Amazon', 'Natasha Lomas@riptari', 'Getty ImagesAmazon’s', 'Norway’s Consumer Council', 'Amazon', 'NCC', 'Finn Lützow-Holm Myrstad', 'Amazon’s', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'NCC', 'Amazon', 'Complaints', 'Amazon’s', 'Norway’s Marketing Control Act', 'NCC', 'FTC', 'Amazon’s', 'VZBV', 'Amazon’s', 'VZBV', 'the Federation of German Consumer Organisations', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Google’s', 'the Irish Data Protection Commission', 'WTF', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Amazon', 'Natasha', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

And yet, the company has mostly been focused on personal loans and more recently credit cards. You couldn’t just replace your bank account with Upgrade. Upgrade is adding two important missing pieces of the puzzle, with checking accounts and debit cards.With today’s launch, Upgrade competes more directly with other challenger banks, such as Chime, N26 and others. You can open a checking account, control it from a mobile app and send and receive money from that account.There are no monthly fees and no minimum account balance. Under the hood, Cross River Bank provides FDIC-insured checking accounts.You also get a debit card with your checking account. When it comes to ATM withdrawals, Upgrade will reimburse ATM fees for its most loyal customers up to five times a month. You need to maintain a minimum balance or set up direct payroll deposit for that feature.Debit card payments on subscriptions and common everyday expenses let you earn 2% cash back. Eligible purchases include convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants, food deliveries, etc. You earn 1% on other debit charges.Rewards on debit card transactions are somewhat uncommon. Most financial companies focus on credit card rewards as the interchange fees on credit card transactions are much higher. Debit cards don’t generate as much interchange revenue.“Neobanks in particular cannot pay high rewards (or any rewards at all) on debit cards because the interchange fee is often their only source of revenue,” Upgrade CEO Renaud Laplanche told me in an email.And interchange fees can add up if you manage to attract millions of customers. According to The Information, Chime generated more than $600 million in revenue last year thanks to interchange fees.The company still plans to generate the vast majority of its revenue from credit products. “Our strategy is to monetize our base through credit,” Laplanche said.Upgrade also offers a credit card with 1.5% cash back on all purchases. If, for one reason or another, you can’t pay your monthly balance payment, the company helps you combine monthly charges into installment plans that you can pay back over 24 to 60 months. You pay down your balance at a fixed rate with equal monthly payments. Upgrade customers who use the company’s checking account will get lower rates on Upgrade loans.You can also get a personal loan from Upgrade without a credit card or a checking account. And maybe you’ll end up discovering Upgrade’s other products after signing up to a personal loan.Image Credits: Upgrade']",OFLO,"['NavigationClose', 'UpgradeFintech', 'Chime', 'N26', 'Cross River Bank', 'FDIC', 'ATM', 'ATM', 'Renaud Laplanche', 'The Information, Chime', 'Laplanche', 'UpgradeclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

For example, one of the segments the platform identifies are people who have made one purchase already, but are unlikely to buy again unless they see an ad or promotion soon. Segments Analytics can be used for advertising across multiple channels, including email, Facebook and Google.Tresl claims that brands using Segments Analytics have increased their clickthrough rates on abandoned cart flows (or reminders sent to customers who have unpurchased items) by 30% and grown sales by 40% month-over-month within one month of implementing the platform.Segments Analytics is currently available through the Shopify App Store, with subscriptions starting from $79 a month.']",Minna Technologies,"['NavigationClose ScreenTresl’s', 'Shu@catherineshu /', 'Getty ImagesTresl’s', 'Segment Analytics', 'Tresl', 'Segments Analytics', 'Shopify', 'Tresl', 'Segments Analytics', 'Segments Analytics', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Segment Analytics', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Founded in 2017, one of 3rens’ first clients was an electric scooter company that mostly serves tourists. It installed 3Drens’ IoT box onto scooters to send alerts if scooters were potentially involved in accidents or if a user went over the time they had paid for. It also generated a heat map of where the scooters traveled the most often, so the company was able to make partnerships with popular venues and attractions.3Drens’ platform can also help logistics services pick the right type of vehicle for a delivery, predict the best routes and assign new tasks for drivers on their way back after an order is fulfilled.']",BlaBla,"['NavigationClose', 'Shu@catherineshu', 'COVID-19', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The round was led by an unnamed party, but round participants included Accel, Lakestar, HV Capital, Project A and Scania. Sources say Hedosophia may be the unnamed growth investor, although Sennder declined to comment. To date, Sennder has raised more than $260 million, allowing it to lay claim to a potential $1 billion valuation.Sennder directly connects enterprise shippers with trucking companies, thus disintermediating the traditional freight model. It says it will move over 1 million truckloads this year. So far it has concentrated on the lucrative European market. In June 2020 it merged with French competitor Everoad, and acquired Uber Freight’s European business last September. The European logistics and freight sector has a market size of $427 billion.Sennder competes with large incumbents like Wincanton and CH Robinson, as well as other startups such as OnTrac and Instafreight.The whole digital freight forwarding market is booming.

But most banks don’t have much of an answer. Step in Minna Technologies, which sells in its subscription management services into banking apps.It has now raised $18.8 million (€15.5 million/£14 million) in Series B fundraising from Element Ventures, MiddleGame Ventures, Nineyards Equity and Visa, to expand its open banking technology to banks globally.Founded in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2016, Minna enables customers to manage subscription services via their existing bank’s app. Using Minna, customers can terminate subscriptions just from their banking app, automatically, cutting the data and financial ties between the merchant and customer. The platform can also notify customers when a free trial is about to end and facilitates utilities switching, allowing them to find better deals. So far, Minna has partnerships with Lloyds Banking Group, Swedbank and ING.Minna’s technology reduces the burden on a bank’s call centers, plus banks can also benefit financially from Minna’s role in facilitating utility switching, raising the prospect of banks becoming marketplaces.The appearance of Minna suggests that the first wave of neo-banks is about to be accompanied by a second wave of overlaid services such as this. The average European is spending £301 (€333) a month on 11 subscriptions, which is predicted to increase to £459 (€508) a month on 17 subscriptions by 2025.

Why not learn English through TikTok-like videos too? That was what prompted Angelo Huang to launch BlaBla.Originally from Taiwan, Huang relocated to Shanghai in 2019 to start BlaBla after working in Silicon Valley for over a decade. A year later, BlaBla was chosen as part of Y Combinator’s 2020 summer cohort. The coronavirus had begun to spread in the U.S. at the time, keeping millions at home, and interest in remote learning was reviving.“It was my eighth time applying to YC,” Huang, who founded two companies before BlaBla, told TechCrunch during an interview.This week, BlaBla announced it has raised $1.54 million in a seed round led by Amino Capital, Starling Ventures, Y Combinator and Wayra X, the innovation arm of the Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica. While Y Combinator wasn’t particularly instrumental in BlaBla’s expansion in China — one of the biggest English-learning markets — the famed accelerator was of great help introducing investors to the young company, said the founder.The BlaBla app pays native English speakers by the hour to create short, engaging videos tailored to English-learning students around the world. The content creators are aided by BlaBla’s proprietary software that can recognize and tag their scenes, as well as third-party translation tools that can subtitle their videos. The students, in turn, pay a subscription fee to receive personalized video recommendations based on their level of proficiency. They can practice through the app’s built-in speech recognition, among other features like speaking contests and pop quizzes.The startup is in a highly crowded space. In China, the online English-learning market is occupied by established companies like VIPKID, which is backed by Tencent and Sequoia Capital. Compared to VIPKID’s one-on-one tutoring model, BlaBla is more affordable, with its starting price of 39 yuan ($6) a month, Huang noted.“The students [on mainstream English learning apps] might have to spend several thousands of RMB before they can have a meaningful conversation with their teachers. We instead recycle our videos and are able to offer lessons at much cheaper prices.”The app has about 11,000 weekly users and 300-400 paid users at the moment, with 80-90% of its total users coming from China; the goal for this year is to reach 300,000 students. The funding will allow BlaBla to expand in Southeast Asia and Latin America, while Wayra X can potentially help it scale to Telefónica’s 340 million global users. It will be seeking brand deals with influencers on the likes of TikTok and YoutTube. The new capital will also enable BlaBla to add new features, such as pairing up language learners based on their interests and profiles.BlaBla doesn’t limit itself to teaching English, and has ambitions to bring in teachers of other languages. “We want to be a global online pay-for-knowledge platform,” said Huang.Here are the 94 companies from Y Combinator’s Summer 2020 Demo Day 2']",said today ,"['NavigationClose', 'BlablaShort', 'Angelo Huang', 'Huang', 'Y Combinator’s', 'Huang', 'BlaBla', 'Amino Capital', 'Starling Ventures', 'Y Combinator and Wayra X', 'Telefónica', 'VIPKID', 'Tencent and Sequoia Capital', 'VIPKID', 'Huang', 'Wayra X', 'TikTok', 'Huang', 'Y Combinator’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The review found an identified number of apps violated Play Store’s safety policies and they were immediately removed from the Store.Google, whose Android operating system powers 98% of smartphones in India, said it has asked the developers of the remaining identified apps to demonstrate that their apps are in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations. (In an email reviewed by TechCrunch, Google had asked a developer to provide documentation within five days.)Indian startups explore alliance and alternative app store to fight Google’s ‘monopoly’“Apps that fail to do so will be removed without further notice. In addition, we will continue to assist the law enforcement agencies in their investigation of this issue,” the company said.Users have identified several lending apps including 10MinuteLoan and Ex-Money in India in recent months that granted small ticket loans (typically in the range of $50 to $200) to people for short tenures without much verification to determine their eligibility, and then charged steep processing fees.To avoid such abuse, Google said Play Store will only allow personal apps that require customers to make their repayment in 60 days or longer.When borrowers struggled to repay their debt in the short period, collection agents on behalf of some lending apps among other ill tactics threatened to embarrass them in front of their friends, colleagues and family. In November, local newspaper Indian Express reported that a 23-year-old man committed suicide after being bullied by a money lending app. It’s not the only reported suicide case linked to such harassment in recent months.Online loan  horror : Representative of a loan app called "" Udhaar Loan "" Asking a girl from Tamilnadu to video call her naked , if she fails to pay loan on time .

A preliminary investigation found that these apps had processed nearly $2.9 billion through 14 million transactions.Srikanth L of CashlessConsumer, a consumer collective on digital payments, told TechCrunch that Google took too much time to turn its attention to this issue. Srikanth, who has been tracking online lending apps in India for several quarters, said more than 100 apps in the last 10 days and about 450 in recent months had disappeared from Google Play Store, citing his own analysis.He also criticized Google for not doing enough to stop apps from gleaning a wide range of data from a customer’s Android phone. “They still don’t mandate these apps to disclose their website and physical address,” he added.“To protect user privacy, developers must only request permissions that are necessary to implement current features or services. They should not use permissions that give access to user or device data for undisclosed, unimplemented, or disallowed features or purposes,” wrote Suzanne Frey, vice president, Product, Android Security and Privacy, in a blog post.“Developers must also only use data for purposes that the user has consented to, and if they later want to use the data for other purposes, they must obtain user permission for the additional uses,” she added.Thursday’s move comes months after Google stepped up its efforts to crack down on fantasy sports apps in India.Google pulls India’s Paytm app from Play Store for repeat policy violations']",Sennder,"['NavigationClose ScreenGoogle', 'Sanjeev Verma / Hindustan Times / Getty ImagesGoogle', 'Android', 'Android', 'Google', 'Ex-Money', 'Google', 'Indian Express', 'Tamilnadu', 'Prashanth Rangaswamy', 'Srikanth L', 'CashlessConsumer', 'Suzanne Frey', 'Android Security and Privacy', 'Google', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Hrvhwzvo2u,2021-01-14T06:00:21,Germany’s Xentral nabs $20M led by Sequoia to help online-facing SMBs run back offices better,"['Small enterprises remain one of the most underserved segments of the business market, but the growth of cloud-based services — easier to buy, easier to provision — has helped that change in recent years. Today, one of the more promising startups out of Europe building software to help SMEs run online businesses is announcing some funding to better tap into both the opportunity to build these services, and to meet a growing demand from the SME segment.Xentral, a German startup that develops enterprise resource planning software covering a variety of back-office functions for the average online small business, has picked up a Series A of $20 million.The company’s platform today covers services like order and warehouse management, packaging, fulfillment, accounting and sales management, and the majority of its 1,000 customers are in Germany — they include the likes of direct-to-consumer brands like YFood, KoRo, the Nu Company and Flyeralarm.But Benedikt Sauter, the co-founder and CEO of Xentral, said the ambition is to expand into the rest of Europe, and eventually other geographies, and to fold in more services to its ERP platform, such as a more powerful API to allow customers to integrate more services — for example in cases where a business might be selling on their own site, but also Amazon, eBay, social platforms and more — to bring their businesses to a wider market.Mainly, he said, the startup wants “to build a better ecosystem to help our customers run their own businesses better.”The funding is being led by Sequoia Capital, with Visionaires Club (a B2B-focused VC out of Berlin) also participating.Berlin’s Visionaries Club outs two new €40M micro funds for seed and growth-stage B2BThe deal is notable for being the prolific, high-profile VC’s first investment in Europe since officially opening for business in the region. (Sequoia has backed a number of startups in Europe before this, including Graphcore, Klarna, Tessian, Unity, UiPath, n8n and Evervault — but all of those deals were done from afar.)Augsburg-based Xentral has been around as a startup since 2018, and “as a startup” is the operative phrase here.Sauter and his co-founder Claudia Sauter (who is also his co-founder in life: she is his wife) built the early prototype for the service originally for themselves.The pair were running a business of their own — a hardware company they founded in 2008, selling not nails, hammers and wood, but circuit boards they designed, along with other hardware to build computers and other connected objects. Around 2013, as the business was starting to pick up steam, they decided that they really needed better tools to manage everything at the backend so that they would have more time to build their actual products.But Bene Sauter quickly discovered a problem in the process: smaller businesses may have Shopify and its various competitors to help manage e-commerce at the front end, but when it came to the many parts of the process at the backend, there really wasn’t a single, easy solution (remember this was eight years ago, at a time before the Shopifys of the world were yet to expand into these kinds of tools). Being of a DIY and technical persuasion — Sauter had studied hardware engineering at university — he decided that he’d try to build the tools that he wanted to use.The Sauters used those tools for years, until without much outbound effort, they started to get some inbound interest from other online businesses to use the software, too. That led to the Sauters balancing both their own hardware business and selling the software on the side, until around 2017/2018 when they decided to wind down the hardware operation and focus on the software full time. And from then, Xentral was born. It now has, in addition to 1,000 customers, some 65 employees working on developing the platform.The focus with Xentral is to have a platform that is easy to implement and use, regardless of what kind of SME you might be as long as you are selling online. But even so, Sauter pointed out that the other common thread is that you need at least one person at the business who champions and understands the value of ERP. “It’s really a mindset,” he said.The challenge with Xentral in that regard will be to see how and if they can bring more businesses to the table and tap into the kinds of tools that it provides, at the same time that a number of other players also eye up the same market. (Others in the same general category of building ERP for small businesses include online payments provider Sage, NetSuite and Acumatica.) ERP overall is forecast to become a $49.5 billion market by 2025.Sequoia and its new partner in Europe, Luciana Lixandru — who is joining Xentral’s board along with Visionaries’ Robert Lacher — believe however that there remains a golden opportunity to build a new kind of provider from the ground up and out of Europe specifically to target the opportunity in that region.“I see Xentral becoming the de facto platform for any SMEs to run their businesses online,” she said in an interview. “ERP sounds a bit scary especially because it makes one think of companies like SAP, long implementation cycles, and so on. But here it’s the opposite.” She describes Xentral as “very lean and easy to use because you an start with one module and then add more. For SMEs it has to be super simple. I see this becoming like the Shopify for ERP.”']", indefinitely locking President Trump’s Snapchat account,"['NavigationClose ScreenGermany’s', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'YFood', 'KoRo', 'the Nu Company', 'Benedikt Sauter', 'Xentral', 'Amazon', 'eBay', 'Sequoia Capital', 'Visionaires Club', 'VC', 'Visionaries Club', 'VC’s', 'n8n', 'Evervault', 'afar.)Augsburg', 'Xentral', 'Claudia Sauter', 'Bene Sauter', 'DIY', 'Sauter', 'Xentral', 'Xentral', 'Sauter', 'ERP', 'Xentral', 'NetSuite', 'Luciana Lixandru', 'Xentral’s', 'Visionaries', 'Robert Lacher', 'Xentral', 'Xentral', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Lunden7:00 AM', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/cqxyqLUKFp,2021-01-14T03:43:42,Poshmark is pushing into the public market at a high-end valuation as the resale market sizzles,"['Poshmark, the nine-year-old, Redwood City, California-based online marketplace for second-hand clothing, beauty and home decor products, is set to start trading as a public company on the Nasdaq tomorrow after tonight pricing 6.6 million shares higher than originally planned, according to Bloomberg.Per its report, the company, which earlier expected to sell shares at between $35 and $39, saw enough demand to rationalize a $42-per-share price — one that values the company at $3.5 billion on a fully diluted basis.Given investors’ feverish embrace of all kinds of newly public consumer brands, including Airbnb, DoorDash and, to a more moderate degree, Wish (trading currently where it opened when it hit the market in mid-December), most industry observers anticipate smooth sailing for the company as it makes the move from private to publicly traded company.It has numerous things going for it.More than 70 million Poshmark users having sold more than 130 million items through the platform since its inception, according to the company. And its revenue is moving in the right direction. Poshmark makes money off commissions on peer-to-peer sales and on products that it sells via wholesale, and it turned profitable last year for the first time. According to its S-1, it produced net income of $21 million off revenue of $193 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared with a net loss of $34 million on revenue of $150 million during the same period in 2019.Also, unlike many brick-and-mortar retail businesses that were hit especially hard by pandemic-related shutdowns — J. Crew, Neiman Marcus and Brooks Brothers are just a few of many to declare bankruptcy — Poshmark only facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers, so it doesn’t have the burden or expense of holding inventory.Resale platforms of all stripes have the wind at their back right now, in fact. Resale can be more affordable. It can be a means for sellers to make money. Moreover, shoppers are more interested than ever in sustainability, and buying someone else’s never or lightly used items is more environmentally friendly than supporting, say, a fast fashion brand. (Forever 21, the fast-fashion mall staple, filed for bankruptcy in 2019.)What Poshmark has to overcome includes improving the customer experience, if a variety of review sites is to be believed. The company consistently receives poor marks for its quality control and support service.Though profitable, it’s not yet terribly profitable, which may need to change, and quickly.Poshmark, which has raised $153 million from its venture investors, is also challenged with making public market investors understand how it differs from already publicly traded rivals like eBay and The RealReal, which went public in 2019 and whose current market cap is roughly $2.3 billion.It will need to differentiate itself from other companies hot on its heels, too.

Both K3 Ventures and GGV Capital were early investors in Grab, which was founded in 2012.Back in February 2020, Grab announced it had raised $856 million in funding to grow its payment and financial services. That news came during speculation that Grab and Gojek, one of it top rivals, were finally getting closer to a merger after lengthy discussions.But the Grab-Gojek talks stalled, and Gojek is now reportedly in talks to merge with Indonesia e-commerce platform Tokopedia instead. According to Bloomberg, the combined company would be worth $18 billion, making it a more formidable rival to Grab.In its funding announcement, Grab Financial Group said its total revenues grew more than 40% in 2020, compared to 2019. This was driven by strong consumer adoption of services like AutoInvest, an investment platform that allows users to invest small amounts of money at a time through the Grab app and insurance products. Grab Financial announced the launch of several financial products for consumers and SMEs in August 2020.Usage of digital financial services by consumers and SMEs in Southeast Asia increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a report published by Google, Temasek and Bain & Company in November, usage of banking apps and online payments, remittances, insurance products and robo-advisor investment platforms all grew in 2020, and the region’s financial services market may reach $60 billion in revenue by 2025.Grab launches new consumer financial services, including micro-investments and loansA consortium between Grab-Singtel was also among several firms awarded a full digital-banking license by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in December 2020.In a press statement, Hanwha Asset Management chief executive officer Yong Hyun Kim said, “We expect GFG to continue its exponential growth on the back of an innovative business model which supports the changing broader lifestyle of consumers, as well as its highly synergistic relationship with Grab, the largest Southeast Asian unicorn.”Grab-Singtel and Ant Group win digital bank licenses in Singapore']",NHTSA determines sudden acceleration complaints in Tesla vehicles were due to driver error,"['Grab Financial Group', 'Hanwha Asset Management', 'NavigationClose ScreenGrab Financial Group', 'Hanwha Asset ManagementCatherine Shu@catherineshu /', 'Brent Lewin/Bloomberg', 'Getty ImagesGrab Financial Group', 'Hanwha Asset Management', 'K3 Ventures', 'GGV Capital', 'Arbor Ventures', 'Flourish Ventures', 'The Financial Times', 'Grab Financial', 'Grab', 'K3 Ventures', 'GGV Capital', 'Grab', 'Grab', 'Grab', 'Gojek', 'Tokopedia', 'Grab Financial Group', 'AutoInvest', 'Grab Financial', 'Bain & Company', 'Grab-Singtel', 'the Monetary Authority of Singapore', 'Hanwha Asset Management', 'Yong Hyun Kim', 'Grab', 'Singtel', 'Ant Group', 'SingaporeclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsTCgrabGrab Financial GroupHanwha Asset ManagementSoutheast AsiaGrab Financial Group', 'Hanwha Asset ManagementCatherine', '2021Grab Financial Group', 'Hanwha Asset Management', 'K3 Ventures', 'GGV Capital', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The round was led by an unnamed party, but round participants included Accel, Lakestar, HV Capital, Project A and Scania. Sources say Hedosophia may be the unnamed growth investor, although Sennder declined to comment. To date, Sennder has raised more than $260 million, allowing it to lay claim to a potential $1 billion valuation.Sennder directly connects enterprise shippers with trucking companies, thus disintermediating the traditional freight model. It says it will move over 1 million truckloads this year. So far it has concentrated on the lucrative European market. In June 2020 it merged with French competitor Everoad, and acquired Uber Freight’s European business last September. The European logistics and freight sector has a market size of $427 billion.Sennder competes with large incumbents like Wincanton and CH Robinson, as well as other startups such as OnTrac and Instafreight.The whole digital freight forwarding market is booming.

But after temporary bans from his Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts as well as a permanent ban from Twitter, Snap has decided that it will also be making its ban of the President’s Snapchat account permanent.Though Trump’s social media preferences as a user are clear, Snapchat gave the Trump campaign a particularly effective platform to target young users who are active on the service. A permanent ban will undoubtedly complicate his future business and political ambitions as he finds himself removed from most mainstream social platforms.Trump’s deplatorming follows riots last week at the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob emboldened by the President himself. Since then, a number of companies have severed ties with the Trump brand, while social platforms have aimed to minimize Trump’s presence on their platforms in his final days as President and beyond.Snap says it made the decision in light of repeated attempted violations of the company’s community guidelines that had been made over the past several months by the President’s account.“Last week we announced an indefinite suspension of President Trump’s Snapchat account, and have been assessing what long term action is in the best interest of our Snapchat community. In the interest of public safety, and based on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence, which are clear violations of our guidelines, we have made the decision to permanently terminate his account,” a Snap spokesperson told TechCrunch.Snap’s decision to permanently ban the President was first reported by Axios.The deplatforming of President Trump\xa0']",Pace,"['Trump’s', 'NavigationClose', 'Trump’s', 'Snap', 'Trump’s', 'YouTube', 'Snap', 'Trump’s', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'pro-Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy', 'Trump’s', 'Snap', 'Trump’s', 'YouTube', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/kbk3OTsexT,2021-01-14T00:29:28,Trump circumvents Twitter ban to decry ‘unprecedented assault on free speech’,"['Following a comprehensive ban from Twitter and a number of other online services following last week’s assault on the Capitol by his followers, President Trump managed to put out a tweet in the form of a video address touching on the “calamity at the Capitol”… and, of course, his deplatforming.In the video, Trump instructs his followers to shun violence, calling it un-American. “No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence,” he said, days after calling rioters “great patriots” and telling them “we love you, you’re very special” as they despoiled the House and Senate.He pivoted after a few minutes to the topic that, after his historic second impeachment, is almost certainly foremost on his mind: being banned from his chief instrument of governance, Twitter.“I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days,” he said, although the bans and other actions are all due to documented breaches of the platforms’ rules. “The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong, and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another.”The deplatforming of President TrumpAfter having his @realdonaldtrump handle suspended by Twitter, Trump attempted to sockpuppet a few other prominent accounts of allies, but was swiftly shut down. What everyone assumed must be plans to join Parler were scuttled along with the social network itself, which has warned it may be permanently taken offline after Amazon and other internet infrastructure companies refused to host it.In case you’re wondering how Trump was able to slip this one past Twitter’s pretty decisive ban to begin with, we were curious too.Twitter tells TechCrunch:This Tweet is not in violation of the Twitter Rules. As we previously made clear, other official administration accounts, including @WhiteHouse, are permitted to Tweet as long as they do not demonstrably engage in ban evasion or share content that otherwise violates the Twitter Rules.In other words, while Trump the person was banned, Trump the head of the Executive branch may still have some right, in the remaining week he holds the office, to utilize Twitter as a way of communicating matters of importance to the American people.This gives a somewhat unfortunate impression of a power move, as Twitter has put itself in the position of determining what is a worthwhile transmission and what is a rabble-rousing incitement to violence. I’ve asked the company to clarify how it is determined whether what Trump does on this account is considered ban evasion.Meanwhile, almost simultaneous with Trump’s surprise tweet, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey unloaded 13 tweets’ worth of thoughts about the situation: I believe this was the right decision for Twitter. We faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.That said, having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications. While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us.Jack neither reaches any real conclusions nor illuminates any new plans, but it’s clear he is thinking real hard about this. As he notes, however, it’ll take a lot of work to establish the “one humanity working together” he envisions as a sort of stretch goal for Twitter and the internet in general.Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension\xa0']",At least one of Samsung’s new robots is definitely coming out (hint: it’s the vacuum),"['NavigationClose', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'House', 'Senate', 'Twitter', 'TrumpAfter', 'Twitter', 'Trump', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Trump', 'Twitter’s', '@WhiteHouse', 'Trump', 'Executive', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'Jack Dorsey', 'Jack', 'Parler', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Coldewey1:29 AM', 'Trump', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Reports of the MCUs suddenly failing have been a topic for years in Tesla forums.The failure is caused when the memory storage in a flash drive used in these vehicles reaches capacity, investigators concluded. The only solution is to replace the physical piece of hardware. Vehicles affected include Model S sedans built between 2012 and 2018 as well as Model X SUVs in 2016 through 2018.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company did provide information to NHTSA, which is contained in the report. Tesla confirmed to NHTSA that all units will inevitably fail given the memory device’s finite storage capacity. Tesla provided its own statistical model showing the number of projected weekly MCU repairs from 2020 to 2028. The automaker estimated that replacement rates for MCU failures will peak in early 2022 and gradually decline until (near) full part turnover has been accomplished in 2028, according to the report.These vehicles are equipped with an Nvidia Tegra 3 processor with an integrated 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device. Part of this 8GB storage capacity is used each time the vehicle is started. The eMMC NAND cell hardware fails when the storage capacity is reached, resulting in failure of the MCU, the agency said.The eMMC NAND flash device’s lifespan based upon the number of program/erase cycles, after which the MCU fails due to memory wear-out. Investigators determined that the expected usage life rating for the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory device is about 3,000 Program-Erase cycles, after which the eMMC NAND flash memory device would become fully consumed and no longer be operational. At a daily cycle usage rate of 1.4 per block, accumulation of 3,000 P/E cycles would take only five to six years, the agency said.The agency has officially requested that Tesla initiate a recall to notify all owners, purchasers and dealers of the subject vehicles of this safety defect and provide a remedy.NHTSA determines sudden acceleration complaints in Tesla vehicles were due to driver error']",canceling all reservations,"['Tesla', 'NavigationClose', 'Tesla', 'the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration', 'The Office of Defects Investigation', 'Autopilot', 'Model S', 'NHTSA', 'Tesla', 'NHTSA', 'MCU', 'MCU', 'Nvidia Tegra', 'MCU', 'MCU', 'NHTSA', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Korosec1:03 AM', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Most of SNKRDUNK’s transactions are within Japan now, but it plans to become a cross-border marketplace.Along with SODA’s $3 million Series A last year, this brings the startup’s total funding to $25 million.While the COVID-19 pandemic was initially expected to put a damper on the sneaker resell market, C2C marketplaces have actually seen their business increase. For example, StockX, one of the biggest sneaker resell platforms in the world (which hit a valuation of $2.8 billion after its recent Series E), said May and June 2020 were its biggest months for sales ever.StockX raises $275M Series E, valuing the retailer at $2.8BSNKRDUNK’s sales also grew last year, and in December 2020, it recorded a 3,000% year-over-year increase in monthly gross merchandise value. Chief executive officer Yuta Uchiyama told TechCrunch this was because demand for sneakers remained high, while more people also started buying things online.A promotional image from SNKRDUNK, Japan’s largest sneaker reselling platformLaunched in 2018, SNKRDUNK now has 2.5 million monthly users, which it says makes it the largest C2C sneaker marketplace in Japan. The Series B will allow it to speed up the pace of its international expansion, add more categories and expand its authentication facilities.Like StockX and GOAT, SNKRDUNK’s user fees cover authentication holds before sneakers are sent to buyers. The company partners with FAKE BUSTERS, an authentication service based in Japan, to check sneakers before they are sent to buyers.In addition to its marketplace, SNKRDUNK also runs a sneaker news site and an online community.SODA plans to work with other companies in SoftBank Venture Asia’s portfolio that develop AI-based tech to help automate its operations, including logistics, payment, customer service and counterfeit inspection.Sneaker enthusiast group SoleSavy raises $2M, setting the stage for a community-driven commerce boom']",Weezy,"['SODA', 'SoftBank Ventures Asia', 'NavigationClose ScreenTokyo', 'SODA', 'SoftBank Ventures', 'Kwangmoozaa', 'Getty ImagesTokyo', 'SODA', 'SNKRDUNK', 'SoftBank Ventures Asia', 'SNKRDUNK’s', 'Yuta Uchiyama', 'SNKRDUNK', 'SNKRDUNK', 'SNKRDUNK’s', 'SNKRDUNK', 'SoftBank Venture Asia’s', 'AI', 'SoleSavy', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsRecent', 'FundingStartupsTCAsiaC2C', 'SODA', 'SoftBank Ventures AsiaCatherine', 'SODA', 'SNKRDUNK', 'SoftBank Ventures Asia', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/wGZ74s3yNe,2021-01-13T23:34:21,Pace launches out of private beta with a plan to scale virtual group therapy,"['One in five people have a mental health illness. Pace, a new startup founded by Pinterest and Affirm executives, wants to pay attention to the other four in that statistic.“Nobody is perfectly mentally healthy all the time,” said Jack Chou, Pace co-founder. “It’s a non-existent idea, everyone is sort of swimming in between being clinically mentally unhealthy and perfectly mentally happy.”While diagnosable mental health conditions might get an individual medication or therapy, those that live in a grey space might still need resources to stay afloat. After Chou experienced the detrimental effects of burnout while working for Pinterest and Affirm, and co-founder Cat Lee, formerly of Pinterest and Maveron, experienced a personal travesty, the former colleagues realized there needed to be a way to help people who didn’t fit squarely into one bucket.So Pace, which launched out of private beta today, wants to address this fallacy by creating small-group training classes for people interested in taking care of their emotional and mental health. It is launching with $1.9 million in seed funding. Investors include Nellie and Max Levchin, Jeff Weiner, Emilie Choi, Ben Silbermann, Box Group, and SV Angel.The core of the product is a 90-minute live video group session once a week, delivered through Pace’s platform. The video component integrates with Twilio and Agora (and interestingly, not Zoom, because its SDK lacks personalization options). Users can attend the sessions on Web, iOS or Android.Image Credits: PacePace forms cohorts of eight to 10 people around shared interest or identities, such as a founder group or parent group. Then, Pace interviews a new user for 15 to 30 minutes to learn about what they hope to get out of the experience.Once a group is formed, they meet weekly with a facilitator at the helm. While it’s not trying to be a therapy replacement, the startup is looking for facilitators who are licensed in mental health practice. To help them do this, Pace secured two founding members who are psychologists: Dr. Kerry Makin-Byrd and Dr. Vivian Oberling.When users sign on, they are prompted to pick three words that describe themselves from dozens of options. Those words show up under their video as they talk, and help skip some small talk in the beginning of the sessions.The group talks about a variety of topics, from how to manage stress to how to adapt to a remote world. There is no formal curriculum, but each class has a takeaway for participants to leave with.Pace doesn’t follow any specific curriculum during the meetings, but instead uses the time for people to talk through their feelings. Facilitators are licensed mental health clinicians, with the majority of the leaders being part-time or freelancers.\xa0It plans to introduce asynchronous ways for group members to chat and stay in touch beyond the weekly class, as well as spend time building out a product that feels beyond a Zoom call.Mental health software startups are on a tear right now. Last month, Lyra Health raised $175 million at a $2.25 billion valuation to connect employees to therapists and mental health services. Another telehealth provider, Talkspace, announced today that it was going public through a SPAC. There’s also Calm, last valued at $2 billion, and Headspace, its biggest competitor in the mindfulness app space.Calm raises $75M more at $2B valuationPace’s focus is more similar to the latter than the former: It’s avoiding the telehealth label and positioning itself more as supplementary to formal health services.“Our hope is that as [therapists] have individual patients who they’d like to incorporate some group work, or need a next thing, that we’re here for that too,” says Chou.One of Pace’s closest competitors is Coa, which launched with $3 million in seed funding in October 2020. The startup is similarly using small-group fitness culture and applying it to mental health. It mixes lecture-style teaching with breakout sessions to breed conversation.Pace wouldn’t expand on how it differentiates from Coa beyond alluding to upcoming product features and community investments. Coa charges $25 for drop-in classes (sticking to that fitness class theme) while Pace charges $45 per week for the same group to meet for months at a time. While Coa has licensed therapists, Pace has licensed mental health clinicians.Coa co-founders Alexa Meyer and Dr. Emily Anhalt say their service is unique from Pace in a curriculum perspective.“Although all of Coa’s classes are facilitated by licensed therapists, Coa’s classes are different from group therapy,” Meyer said. Coa uses Anhalt’s research around mental happiness to create programming. Both companies are still pre-launch, but Coa says it has 6,000 people on its waitlist.Headspace raises $93 million in equity and debt as it pursues clinical validation for mindfulnessFor both startups, the hurdles ahead are common for any startup: customer acquisition, effectiveness in tracking outcomes and scaling an innately emotional and personalized experience. As Homebrew’s Hunter Walk pointed out in a recent blog post, vulnerable populations being exposed to venture-level risk is a difficult phenomenon. Startups fail often, and in this case, that could mean leaving without once-critical support people who are depending on group therapy.Going forward, the real winner in the mental health fitness space will come down to a thoughtful curriculum and a user experience that brings out vulnerability in people even over a virtual setting. Regardless, innovation pouring into the sector couldn’t come at a better time.Mental wellness platform Lyra Health is raising up to $175M at a $2.25B valuation']",announced at CES,"['NavigationClose', 'PaceOne', 'Pinterest', 'Affirm', 'Jack Chou', 'Chou', 'Pinterest', 'Affirm', 'Cat Lee', 'Pinterest', 'Maveron', 'Nellie', 'Max Levchin', 'Jeff Weiner', 'Emilie Choi', 'Ben Silbermann', 'Box Group', 'Pace’s', 'Zoom', 'SDK', 'Kerry Makin-Byrd', 'Vivian Oberling', 'Lyra Health', 'Talkspace', 'Headspace', 'Calm', 'Chou', 'Pace’s', 'Coa', 'Alexa Meyer', 'Emily Anhalt', 'Meyer', 'Anhalt’s', 'Coa', 'Hunter Walk', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Pinterest', 'Affirm', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/bR4813He7d,2021-01-13T23:11:47,Robotic exoskeletons promise increased mobility and job assistance,"['The last several years have seen a substantial increase of ability for robotic exoskeleton technology. Completely understandable. For one thing, it’s that rare technology you encounter that really feels like it’s going to change lives for the better the first time you see it. I’ve had a number of demos with companies that frankly took my breath away — watching someone walk across the room for the first time in years while their spouse stands by you crying will do that.For another thing, there are two distinct use cases for this tech. The first is the aforementioned mobility — whether it’s full paralysis or simply helping people with walking impairments move a bit more easily. The second is work. Exoskeletons have great potential to ease the burden of lifting heavy objects or standing for extended periods. For this reason, many companies like Esko Bionics have created two distinct divisions to serve both sides.At least one of Samsung’s new robots is definitely coming out (hint: it’s the vacuum)So it’s a big, potential market — albeit one that’s still going to take a number of years to mature. For that reason, we’re really only talking rough projections here. I do think there’s still space for some smaller companies to carve out a meaningful business in the category.I also won’t be surprised when more big companies get involved in the category. It’s a good way to put your stamp on the robotics category. Samsung’s GEMS is certainly the biggest-name product in the category this week at CES — even if it didn’t warrant a ton of stage time. It debuted at the event two years ago and we were able to try it out. For now, the news centered around hardware improvements like battery and the beginning of clinical trials – a necessary part of bringing this sort of healthcare or healthcare-adjacent product to market.Taking a stroll with Samsung’s robotic exoskeletonAs with most of Samsung’s robotics announced at the show this week, the jury is very much still out with regards to how seriously the company is taking the product. Last year it made a brief appearance at CES as part of an “immersive workout experience.”Image Credits: ArchelisSome smaller companies have shown off compelling entries. Japan-based Archelis Inc. is top of mind, showcasing the ArchelisFX, whose name derives from the Japanese word for “walkable chair.” The device is designed for a number of different scenarios, including back pain and those who have recently undergone surgery. The company says it will be available to rent or buy for around $5,000.On the whole, the exoskeletons on display at this year’s virtual CES tend largely toward the mobility side of the equation. Notably absent was Sarcos Robotics, which announced a partnership with Delta Airlines at last year’s event. In September, the company built on that interest to raise a $40 million round.Sarcos raises $40 million to bring its Guardian XO exoskeleton to market']",around 10 million pets,"['NavigationClose', 'SamsungThe', 'Esko Bionics', 'Samsung’s', 'Samsung’s GEMS', 'Samsung’s', 'Samsung’s', 'CES', 'ArchelisSome', 'Archelis Inc.', 'CES', 'Sarcos Robotics', 'Delta Airlines', 'Sarcos', 'Guardian', 'XO', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Also participating were U.K.-based fund DN Capital, earlier investors Heartcore Capital and angel investors, notably Chris Muhr, the Groupon founder.Although the company hasn’t made mention of a later U.S. launch, the presence of U.S. investors would tend to suggest that. Weezy is reminiscent of Kozmo, the on-demand groceries business from the dot-com boom of the late ’90s. However, it differs from Postmates in that it doesn’t do pickups.The cash injection will be used to expand its grocery delivery service across London and the broader UK, and open two fulfillment centers across London. Some 40 more U.K. sites are planned by the end of 2021 and it plans to add 50 new employees in the next four months.Launched in July 2020, Weezy uses its own delivery people on pedal cycles or electric mopeds to deliver goods in less than 15 minutes on average. As well as working with wholesalers, it also sources groceries from independent bakers, butchers and markets.It has pushed at an open door during the pandemic. In Q2 2020, half a million new shoppers joined the grocery delivery sector, which is now worth £14.3 billion in the U.K., according to research.Kristof Van Beveren, co-founder and CEO of Weezy, said in a statement: “People are no longer happy to wait around for deliveries, and there is strong demand for a more efficient service.”London-based Weezy raises pre-seed funding for its 15-minute grocery delivery appWeezy’s co-founders are Kristof Van Beveren and Alec Dent. Van Beveren is formerly from the consumer goods world at Procter & Gamble and McKinsey & Company, while Dent headed up operations at U.K. startup Drover and business development at BlaBlaCar.Harley Miller, managing partner, Left Lane Capital, commented: “Weezy’s founding team have the right balance of drive, experience and temperament to lead in e-commerce innovation and convenience within the UK grocery market and beyond.”Nenad Marovac, founder and managing partner, DN Capital, said: “Even before the pandemic, interest in online grocery shopping was on the rise.

https://t.co/1ihpN3laaf,2021-01-13T17:04:03,"GoPro makes stopping and starting simpler with motion, power, QR triggers","['GoPro may have started out at the intersection of capability and affordability in the action cam space, but since then it has increasingly leaned toward use by professionals or deployment by businesses. The latest features, announced at CES, underline that priority, making the cameras simpler and more automated for rentals and hands-free operation.If you’ve got a Hero 7, 8 or 9 Black, or Max, you should be able to download the latest GoPro Labs firmware, which adds the following convenient features.Motion and USB power triggers: Set the camera to start and stop recording either when power flows to it (in a dash cam situation, for instance) or when in motion (for a bike or ski helmet perhaps). Motion detection is also improved and now works in all video modes.The cameras can already perform various tasks upon scanning QR codes, but here’s a new one: You can use a QR code to tell a device to connect to a specific Wi-Fi network and start streaming. It’s faster than using the app for when you need a quick deployment.An obvious one for tourism is the “one button mode,” which as you might expect limits the controls to starting and stopping video capture. Great both for the less tech-savvy on vacation who can’t handle more than one button’s worth of controls, and also for rental joints tired of their cameras coming back with weird custom settings after an overly tech-savvy customer tweaks them.There are a few other improvements, which you can check out at the press release.']",here,"['GoPro', 'NavigationClose ScreenGoPro', 'CES', 'Max', 'GoPro Labs', 'USB', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/4CZRKic95X,2021-01-13T21:34:45,"Zocdoc founder returns with Shadow, an app that finds lost dogs","['Every year, around 10 million pets go missing in the U.S., and millions of those end up in shelters where they aren’t always reunited with their owners, due to their lack of identification or a microchip. A new mobile app, Shadow, aims to tackle this problem by leveraging a combination of a volunteer network and A.I. technology to help dog owners, in particular.The startup is working in partnership with animal shelters and rescue organizations around the U.S. to pull in photos of the dogs they’re currently housing, then supplements this with photos pulled from social media platforms, like Twitter and Facebook.Shadow claims to use A.I. technology to match the photograph of the missing dogs to possible matches from nearby shelters or the web. (A competitor of Shadow’s claims this is not true. The company reached out to us and we published its comments. We also asked Shadow to clarify its tech, given the claims. The competitor then asked for their name to be removed from the article, after arguing it’s clear the Shadow app relies on its manual matching system. Shadow disputes the competitor’s claim. See details below.)Image Credits: ShadowIf there’s not a match found, Shadow will then set a search radius based on where and when the dog went missing, and suggest other actions that the dog’s owner can take as the next steps.This includes viewing all the photographs from the shelters directly, in the case that the technology matching process missed a possible match, as well as working with other Shadow users to help crowdsource activities like hanging “Lost Dog” flyers around a neighborhood, for example.The app relies on a network of volunteers who help by reviewing shelter photographs and broadcasting missing posters to social media sites they use to increase the chances of the dog being found. Dog owners can even advertise a reward in the app to encourage people to help search.Today, Shadow claims to have grown its volunteer user base to over 30,000. And it says it partnered with the ASPCA, Animal Care Centers of New York and L.A., the Dallas shelter system and others.Image Credits: ShadowWhile Shadow is free to use, it makes money through a virtual tipping mechanism when it makes a successful match and the dog is found. It also offers users the ability to buy an Instagram ad in-app for $10. Here, Shadow provides the visual assets and manages the ad-buying process and placement process on owners’ behalf.The startup, founded by former Zocdoc founder Cyrus Massoumi, has been in a sort of public stealth mode for a few years as it grew beyond its hometown of New York. It’s now offering dog-finding services in 76 counties across 20 U.S. states.We should note that Massoumi’s exit from Zocdoc was complicated. He sued his co-founders and CFO for orchestrating a plot to oust him from the company during a Nov. 2015 board meeting, claiming fraud. The lawsuit detailed the internal strife inside Zocdoc at the time. A New York Supreme Court judge recently dismissed this lawsuit. (The ruling says the case needs to be filed in Delaware, instead of New York). A ruling was not determined due to this dismissal, and no new case is currently on file.Ahead of this, Zocdoc had been accused by Business Insider of having developed a stressful, “bro culture,” in which young, male employees would make inappropriate remarks about the women who worked there. This was ahead of the larger rise of the #MeToo movement, which has since impacted how businesses address these issues in the workplace.Massoumi disputes the claims were exactly as described by the article. The company had 300 salespeople at the time, and while he agrees some people may have acted inappropriately, he also believes the company’s response to those actions was handled properly.“The allegations were fully investigated at Zocdoc and found to be without merit,” he told TechCrunch, adding that Zocdoc was repeatedly recognized as a “best place to work” while he was CEO. (There were never allegations against Massoumi, but ultimately, the buck stops with the CEO.)Shadow today claims a different makeup. It has a team of 12 people, and two-thirds of its product and engineering team are women. Some Zocdoc investors have also returned to back Massoumi again.The startup is funded by Founders Fund, Humbition (Massoumi and Indiegogo founder Slava Rubin’s fund), Lux Capital, firstminute Capital, and other angels.Despite the complicated Zocdoc history, the work Shadow is doing is aiming to solve a problem many people do care about. Millions of pet owners lose their pets to euthanization as they end up at shelters that cannot keep animals indefinitely due to lack of space. Meanwhile, the current system of having lost-pet messages distributed across social media can mean many of those posts aren’t seen — especially in larger metros where there are numerous “lost pet” groups.Image Credits: ShadowAs Shadow began its work in 2018, it was local to the New York area. Its first year, it says it reunited 600 dogs. The next year, it reunited 2,000 dogs. The third year, it reunited 5,000 dogs. Today, it’s nearing 10,000 dogs reunited with owners, the CEO said.More than half of those were since the pandemic began, which saw many new pet owners and increased time spent outdoors with those pets, when dogs can sometimes get loose.Massoumi says he was inspired to found Shadow after a friend lost his own dog, the namesake Shadow. It took the friend over a month to find the dog after both following false leads and being connected with people who tried to help him.“I’m thinking to myself, this is something that happens 100 million times a year, globally … and for people who love pets, this is a lost family member,” Massoumi explains. “It seemed to me to be a similar problem that I’d already been solving in healthcare, where there’s fragmentation — people want to see the doctor and the doctor wants to see the patient, but there’s just not a central way to make it work,” he says.More broadly, he wants to see technology being put to good use to solve problems that people actually care about.“I think there needs to be more technology that injects the humanity back in what everyone does. I think that it’s very core that’s what we’re doing,” he says.Shadow’s app is a free download on iOS and Android.Shadow disputes the allegations of “not having A.I.” made by its competitor. The company claims the following:“We trained custom image models that allow us to automatically classify every photo we have with the breed of the dog and its color. The models return different labels and their likelihood, so using this information as well as other metadata such as location and date, we are able to algorithmically pair lost and found dogs in our system. We also utilize object detection to determine whether an animal is shown in a photo, the type of animal it is, and what portion of the image contains the animal. The detected object bounds of the animal is used to create a cropped photo of only the animal.

https://t.co/mrq4sI4IRo,2021-01-13T21:31:34,Telegram blocks ‘dozens’ of hardcore hate channels threatening violence,"['With many social networks suddenly reevaluating their policies in light of recent political violence in the U.S., the popular messaging app Telegram has begun chipping away at an organized network of neo-Nazi and white supremacist accounts flourishing on the platform.Telegram confirmed to TechCrunch that it has removed dozens of channels over the course of the last day, citing concerns that the accounts were inciting violence.“Our Terms of Service expressly forbid public calls to violence,” Telegram spokesperson Mike Ravdonikas told TechCrunch. “…In the past 24 hours we have blocked dozens of public channels that published calls to violence for thousands of subscribers.”Asked if those takedowns relate to last week’s violent siege of the U.S. Capitol, Ravdonikas said that Telegram will “examine all incoming reports” and that the company is “monitoring the current situation closely.”The company confirmed that a number of accounts TechCrunch had previously observed promoting white supremacy, Nazi iconography and other forms of far-right extremism were part of the new enforcement action, which is still expanding. Some of the blocked channels were still viewable on Telegram’s web client Wednesday.One of those now-removed groups bemoaned Telegram’s bans Tuesday in a post displaying a Nazi flag and the warning “you can’t kill an idea.” Prior to being taken down, that channel boasted more than 10,000 followers.Many extremist channels began publicizing backup accounts Tuesday, pointing subscribers to dozens of other groups where they could continue to gather. Other sympathetic channels chronicled the bans in real-time, posting screenshots documenting violations of Telegram’s terms of service.The cluster of far-right accounts Telegram closed were largely not focused on mainstream U.S. politics or pro-Trump conspiracies. Some of the channels even spoke derisively of QAnon’s outlandish beliefs, dismissing them as a distraction. Many of the channels openly advocated for racial purity through strategic tactics, some gleaned through guides to guerrilla warfare and other texts admins provided for users through Telegram’s hosted files feature. One account advertised itself as “The Neo-Nazi Accelerationists your girlfriend told you not to worry about.”Telegram’s new batch of takedowns appears to be connected to an effort by self-described anti-fascist and activist Gwen Snyder, who marshaled Twitter users in a “mass-reporting campaign” following last week’s violent invasion of the U.S. Capitol.“For years, we’ve been tracking these Nazi Terrorgram channels and reporting horrendous, explicit calls to racist violence and insurrection, and Telegram did nothing,” Snyder told TechCrunch, noting that the new wave of reporting sought to shame the company into action.“It worked, and Telegram is finally dismantling the network of Nazi channels that have spent months and years overtly attempting to incite just the sort of terror we saw in D.C.”Many extremist Telegram channels blamed Snyder for the takedowns, leading to an aggressive doxxing campaign that is now circulating her home address. On one channel calling for her death, an image depicts Snyder’s face with a bloody hole in its forehead. Another image includes an address, screenshots of her Twitter posts and the text “You know what to do.”Snyder says she heard pounding on her door Tuesday night. “My address is all over those channels with people saying I should be shot and raped for this, and they only have to convince one person.”With President Trump suspended from most major platforms and restrictions tightening on pro-Trump conspiracies like QAnon and the Stop the Steal movement, social media users have fled in droves to platforms that remain willing to incubate extremism.Twitter permanently bans President TrumpProminent among those is Parler, a social network hailed by many pro-Trump figures as a politically friendly alternative to mainstream social media. But with Parler offline after Amazon suspended the account’s web hosting services and Apple and Google booted it from their respective app stores, some users flocked to more private options where violent extremism continues to flourish, including Telegram.Apple and Google did not respond to questions about Telegram’s standing and if those companies have issued the messaging app any warnings in the last week.Telegram saw an explosion in growth this month, with 25 million new users signing up within 72 hours. While the timing overlaps with some U.S. social media users denouncing mainstream social platforms, the influx stemmed from viral misinformation about changes to WhatsApp’s data sharing policies with Facebook, which is already notorious for privacy failings.“People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services,” Telegram founder Pavel Durov said in a post to his Telegram channel Tuesday. “They no longer want to be held hostage by tech monopolies that seem to think they can get away with anything as long as their apps have a critical mass of users.”Facebook bans the Proud Boys, cutting the group off from its main recruitment platform']",has fallen apart,"['NavigationClose', 'Hatmaker@tayhatmaker', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Telegram', 'Telegram', 'Mike Ravdonikas', 'Ravdonikas', 'Telegram', 'TechCrunch', 'Telegram’s', 'Telegram', 'pro-Trump', 'QAnon’s', 'Telegram’s', 'Gwen Snyder', 'Telegram', 'Snyder', 'Telegram', 'Telegram', 'Snyder', 'Snyder', 'Trump', 'QAnon', 'TrumpProminent', 'Parler', 'pro-Trump', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Apple', 'Telegram', 'Apple', 'Telegram', 'WhatsApp’s', 'Telegram', 'Pavel Durov', 'Telegram', 'the Proud Boys', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Telegram', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/EFtQngVgDY,2021-01-13T20:35:47,"Foxconn, Geely team up to build electric, autonomous and shared vehicles for automakers","['The electric, autonomous vehicles of the future might be manufactured by Apple’s main supplier Foxconn and Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.The two companies have agreed to form a joint venture focused on contract manufacturing for automakers, with a specific focus on electrification, connectivity and autonomous driving technology as well as vehicles designed for sharing. Each party will hold an equal 50% stake in the new joint venture. The board of directors will consist of five members, with Foxconn appointing three, including the chairman, and Geely Holding appointing two, according to a statement issued by the two companies.The agreement follows moves by both companies to take larger roles in contract manufacturing for automakers. Earlier this week, Geely said it would help China’s search giant Baidu set up a company to produce electric vehicles. Baidu will provide smart driving technologies while Geely will be in charge of car design and manufacturing. Meanwhile, Foxconn has announced plans to help troubled Chinese electric car startup Byton build its M-Byte SUV.China’s search giant Baidu to set up an EV-making ventureGeely Holding Group CEO Daniel Donghui Li said that the global automotive industry is undergoing profound changes. Geely must “actively embrace change, build alliances and synergize resources to create greater value for our users,” he said, adding that Foxconn’s expertise will offer important insight for the transformation and evolution of the automotive industry.The joint venture will provide consulting services on whole vehicles, parts, intelligent drive systems and other automotive ecosystem platforms to automakers as well as ridesharing companies. Geely will bring its experience in the automotive fields of design, engineering, R&D, intelligent manufacturing, supply chain management and quality control while Foxconn will bring its manufacturing and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) know-how.The aim, the companies said, is to help automakers accelerate their transition to new innovative and efficient manufacturing processes and business models based on connected, autonomous, shared and electrified technologies (referred to in the industry as CASE).Dozens of new companies aiming to become the next Tesla or trying to commercialize autonomous vehicles have popped up in recent years, giving this Foxconn-Geely enterprise a long list of potential customers. One of the primary roadblocks to making vehicles at volume is the billions of dollars required to build and tool a factory. That need for capital has prompted a number of EV startups to become publicly traded companies by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. Canoo, Fisker, Lordstown Motors and Nikola Corp. are a few that have merged with a SPAC, otherwise known as a blank-check company.Electric vehicle startup Canoo to go public via SPACFoxconn Technology Group chairman Young-way Liu called the alliance a milestone in cooperation between the automotive and information and communication technology (ICT) industries.“With Foxconn’s globally leading R&D technologies, intelligent manufacturing, and hardware-software integration capabilities, the two parties form a highly complementary partnership which allows us to better serve and meet the diverse needs of different customers, and offer the most advanced, fastest, cost-effective full value-chain vehicle production service platform,” Young-way Liu said, adding that the partnership will\xa0result in tremendous change in the development of the automotive industry.\xa0']",VMware,"['TechCrunchOpen NavigationClose ScreenFoxconn', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'Apple’s', 'Zhejiang Geely Holding Group', 'Geely Holding', 'Baidu', 'Baidu', 'Baidu', 'EV', 'ventureGeely Holding Group', 'Daniel Donghui Li', 'Information and Communication Technology', 'ICT', 'Tesla', 'EV', 'Canoo', 'Fisker', 'Lordstown Motors', 'Nikola Corp.', 'Canoo', 'SPACFoxconn Technology Group', 'Young-way Liu', 'ICT', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'Korosec9:35 PM', 'Apple’s', 'Zhejiang Geely Holding Group', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'EU', 'FairworkNatasha Lomas6:38', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/ISDZ5HcTt9,2021-01-13T19:01:31,These robo-fish autonomously form schools and work as search parties,"['Researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have created a set of fish-shaped underwater robots that can autonomously navigate and find each other, cooperating to perform tasks or just placidly school together.Just as aerial drones are proving themselves useful in industry after industry, underwater drones could revolutionize ecology, shipping and other areas where a persistent underwater presence is desirable but difficult.The last few years have seen interesting new autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, but the most common type is pretty much a torpedo — efficient for cruising open water, but not for working one’s way through the nooks and crannies of a coral reef or marina.Coral Vita cultivates $2M seed to take its reef restoration mission globalFor that purpose, it seems practical to see what Nature herself has seen fit to create, and the Wyss Institute has made a specialty of doing so and creating robots and machinery in imitation of the natural world.In this case, Florian Berlinger, Melvin Gauci and Radhika Nagpal, all co-authors on a new paper published in Science Robotics, decided to imitate not just the shape of a fish, but the way it interacts with its fellows as well.Having been inspired by the sight of schooling fish during scuba diving, Nagpal has pursued the question: “How do we create artificial agents that can demonstrate this kind of collective coherence where a whole collective seems as if it’s a single agent?”Image Credits: Berlinger et al., Science RoboticsTheir answer, Blueswarm, is a collection of small “Bluebots,” 3D-printed in the shape of fish, with fins instead of propellers and cameras for eyes. Although neither you nor I is likely to mistake these for actual fish, they’re far less scary of an object for a normal fish to see than a six-foot metal tube with a propeller spinning loudly in the back. The Bluebots also imitate nature’s innovation of bioluminescence, lighting up with LEDs the way some fish and insects do to signal others. The LED pulses change and adjust depending on each bot’s position and knowledge of its neighbors.Using the simple senses of cameras and a photosensor at the very front, elementary swimming motions and the LEDs, Blueswarm automatically organizes itself into group swimming behaviors, establishing a simple “milling” pattern that accommodates new bots when they’re dropped in from any angle.Image Credits: Berlinger et al, Science RoboticsThe robots can also work together on simple tasks, like searching for something. If the group is given the task of finding a red LED in the tank they’re in, they can each look independently, but when one of them finds it, it alters its own LED flashing to alert and summon the others.It’s not hard to imagine uses for this tech. These robots could get closer to reefs and other natural features safely without alarming the sea life, monitoring their health or looking for specific objects their camera-eyes could detect. Or they could meander around underneath docks and ships inspecting hulls more efficiently than a single craft can. Perhaps they might even be useful in search and rescue.Tiny water-based robot is powered by light and can walk, move cargo and even danceThe research also advances our understanding of how and why animals swarm together in the first place.With this research, we cannot only build more advanced robot collectives, but also learn about collective intelligence in nature. Fish must follow even simpler behavior patterns when swimming in schools than our robots do. This simplicity is so beautiful yet hard to discover,” said Berlinger. “Other researchers have reached out to me already to use my Bluebots as fish surrogates for biological studies on fish swimming and schooling. The fact that they welcome Bluebot among their laboratory fish makes me very happy.”']",its $49 per-share IPO price,"['NavigationClose', 'Berlinger', 'Science RoboticsResearchers', 'Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering', 'the Wyss Institute', 'Florian Berlinger', 'Melvin Gauci', 'Radhika Nagpal', 'Science Robotics', 'Berlinger', 'Science RoboticsTheir', 'Blueswarm', 'Blueswarm', 'Berlinger', 'Bluebot', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'partiesDevin Coldewey8:01 PM', 'Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

But the American government took a dim view of the deal, and according to Axios reporting, Plaid felt like it could be worth more money in time.The TechCrunch team has collected views from venture capitalists, analysts and Anshu Sharma, CEO of another API-powered startup and a former VC to get a better view on the perspectives in the market concerning the blockbuster breakup.From the venture capital side of things, most takes we received were bullish regarding Plaid’s chances now that it’s no longer being taken over by Visa. Amy Cheetham, for example, of Costanoa Ventures, said that the result is “good for the company, ultimately.” She added that Plaid may now see better “talent acquisition,” faster product decisions and a better eventual valuation.“There is so much left for them to build in fintech infrastructure,” Cheetham said in an email, adding that she sees “Stripe-like scale potential” in Plaid. Stripe is reportedly raising capital at a valuation that could reach $100 billion.Cheetham is not alone in her bullish perspective.

https://t.co/Dibuk35XsG,2021-01-13T18:15:00,Pat Gelsinger stepping down as VMware CEO to replace Bob Swan at Intel,"['In a move that could have wide ramifications across the tech landscape, Intel announced that VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger would be replacing interim CEO Bob Swan at Intel on February 15th. The question is why would he leave his job to run a struggling chip giant.The bottom line is he has a long history with Intel, working with some of the biggest names in chip industry lore before he joined VMware in 2009. It has to be a thrill for him to go back to his roots and try to jump start the company.“I was 18 years old when I joined Intel, fresh out of the Lincoln Technical Institute. Over the next 30 years of my tenure at Intel, I had the honor to be mentored at the feet of Grove, Noyce and Moore,” Gelsinger wrote in a blog post announcing his new position.Certainly Intel recognized that the history and that Gelsinger’s deep executive experience should help as the company attempts to compete in an increasingly aggressive chip industry landscape. “Pat is a proven technology leader with a distinguished track record of innovation, talent development, and a deep knowledge of Intel. He will continue a values-based cultural leadership approach with a hyper focus on operational execution,” Omar Ishrak, independent chairman of the Intel board, said in a statement.But Gelsinger is walking into a bit of a mess. As my colleague Danny Crichton wrote in his year-end review of the chip industry last month, Intel is far behind its competitors, and it’s going to be tough to play catch-up:Intel has made numerous strategic blunders in the past two decades, most notably completely missing out on the smartphone revolution and also the custom silicon market that has come to prominence in recent years. It’s also just generally fallen behind in chip fabrication, an area it once dominated and is now behind Taiwan-based TSMC, Crichton wrote.2020’s top 10 enterprise M&A deals totaled a staggering $165BPatrick Moorhead, founder and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, agrees with this assertion, saying that Swan was dealt a bad hand, walking in to clean up a mess that has years long timelines. While Gelsinger faces similar issues, Moorhead thinks he can refocus the company. “I am not foreseeing any major strategic changes with Gelsinger, but I do expect him to focus on the company’s engineering culture and get it back to an execution culture,” Moorhead told me.The announcement comes against the backdrop of massive chip industry consolidation last year with over $100 billion changing hands in four deals, with Nvidia nabbing ARM for $40 billion, the $35 billion AMD-Xilink deal, Analog snagging Maxim for $21 billion and Marvell grabbing Inphi for a mere $10 billion, not to mention Intel dumping its memory unit to SK Hynix for $9 billion.As for VMware, it has to find a new CEO now. As Moorhead says, the obvious choice would be current COO Sanjay Poonen, but for the time being, it will be CFO Zane Rowe serving as interim CEO, rather than Poonen. In fact, it appears that the company will be casting a wider net than internal options. The official announcement states, “VMware’s Board of Directors is initiating a global executive search process to name a permanent CEO…”Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says it will be up to Michael Dell to decide who to hand the reins to, but he believes Gelsinger was stuck at Dell and would not get a broader role, so he left.“VMware has a deep bench, but it will be up to Michael Dell to get a CEO who can innovate on the software side and keep the unique DNA of VMware inside the Dell portfolio going strong, Dell needs the deeper profits of this business for its turnaround,” he said.The stock market seems to like the move for Intel, with the company stock up 7.26%, but not so much for VMware, whose stock was down close to the same amount at 7.72% as we went to publication.2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)']",Winnoz,"['Pat Gelsinger', 'VMware', 'Bob Swan', 'Intel', 'NavigationClose', 'VMware', 'Bob Swan', 'IntelRon Miller@ron_miller', 'Horacio Villalobos / Getty ImagesIn', 'Intel', 'VMware', 'Pat Gelsinger', 'Bob Swan', 'Intel', 'Intel', 'VMware', 'Intel', 'the Lincoln Technical Institute', 'Intel', 'Intel', 'Pat', 'Intel', 'Omar Ishrak', 'Intel', 'Gelsinger', 'Danny Crichton', 'Intel', 'Intel', 'TSMC', 'Crichton wrote.2020’s', 'Moor Insights & Strategy', 'Swan', 'Gelsinger', 'Gelsinger', 'Nvidia', 'AMD', 'Analog', 'Maxim', 'Marvell', 'Intel', 'SK Hynix', 'VMware', 'Moorhead', 'COO Sanjay Poonen', 'CFO Zane Rowe', 'Poonen', 'VMware’s Board of Directors', '”Holger Mueller', 'Constellation Research', 'Michael Dell', 'Gelsinger', 'Dell', 'Michael Dell', 'VMware', 'Dell', 'Dell', 'Intel', 'VMware', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEnterprisePersonnelTCDellIntelPat GelsingervmwarePat Gelsinger', 'VMware', 'Bob Swan', 'IntelRon Miller7:15 PM GMT+1•January 13', 'Intel', 'VMware', 'Pat Gelsinger', 'Bob Swan', 'Intel', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/m4Bv7i9roH,2021-01-13T17:47:53,Facial recognition reveals political party in troubling new research,"['Researchers have created a machine learning system that they claim can determine a person’s political party, with reasonable accuracy, based only on their face. The study, from a group that also showed that sexual preference can seemingly be inferred this way, candidly addresses and carefully avoids the pitfalls of “modern phrenology,” leading to the uncomfortable conclusion that our appearance may express more personal information that we think.The study, which appeared this week in the Nature journal Scientific Reports, was conducted by Stanford University’s Michal Kosinski. Kosinski made headlines in 2017 with work that found that a person’s sexual preference could be predicted from facial data.AI that can determine a person’s sexuality from photos shows the dark side of the data ageThe study drew criticism not so much for its methods but for the very idea that something that’s notionally non-physical could be detected this way. But Kosinski’s work, as he explained then and afterwards, was done specifically to challenge those assumptions and was as surprising and disturbing to him as it was to others. The idea was not to build a kind of AI gaydar — quite the opposite, in fact. As the team wrote at the time, it was necessary to publish in order to warn others that such a thing may be built by people whose interests went beyond the academic:We were really disturbed by these results and spent much time considering whether they should be made public at all. We did not want to enable the very risks that we are warning against. The ability to control when and to whom to reveal one’s sexual orientation is crucial not only for one’s well-being, but also for one’s safety.We felt that there is an urgent need to make policymakers and LGBTQ communities aware of the risks that they are facing. We did not create a privacy-invading tool, but rather showed that basic and widely used methods pose serious privacy threats.Similar warnings may be sounded here, for while political affiliation at least in the U.S. (and at least at present) is not as sensitive or personal an element as sexual preference, it is still sensitive and personal. A week hardly passes without reading of some political or religious “dissident” or another being arrested or killed. If oppressive regimes could obtain what passes for probable cause by saying “the algorithm flagged you as a possible extremist,” instead of for example intercepting messages, it makes this sort of practice that much easier and more scalable.The algorithm itself is not some hyper-advanced technology. Kosinski’s paper describes a fairly ordinary process of feeding a machine learning system images of more than a million faces, collected from dating sites in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., as well as American Facebook users. The people whose faces were used identified as politically conservative or liberal as part of the site’s questionnaire.The algorithm was based on open-source facial recognition software, and after basic processing to crop to just the face (that way no background items creep in as factors), the faces are reduced to 2,048 scores representing various features — as with other face recognition algorithms, these aren’t necessary intuitive things like “eyebrow color” and “nose type” but more computer-native concepts.Image Credits: Michal Kosinski / Nature Scientific ReportsThe system was given political affiliation data sourced from the people themselves, and with this it diligently began to study the differences between the facial stats of people identifying as conservatives and those identifying as liberal. Because it turns out, there are differences.Of course it’s not as simple as “conservatives have bushier eyebrows” or “liberals frown more.” Nor does it come down to demographics, which would make things too easy and simple. After all, if political party identification correlates with both age and skin color, that makes for a simple prediction algorithm right there. But although the software mechanisms used by Kosinski are quite standard, he was careful to cover his bases in order that this study, like the last one, can’t be dismissed as pseudoscience.The most obvious way of addressing this is by having the system make guesses as to the political party of people of the same age, gender and ethnicity. The test involved being presented with two faces, one of each party, and guessing which was which. Obviously chance accuracy is 50%. Humans aren’t very good at this task, performing only slightly above chance, about 55% accurate.The algorithm managed to reach as high as 71% accurate when predicting political party between two like individuals, and 73% presented with two individuals of any age, ethnicity or gender (but still guaranteed to be one conservative, one liberal).Image Credits: Michal Kosinski / Nature Scientific ReportsGetting three out of four may not seem like a triumph for modern AI, but considering people can barely do better than a coin flip, there seems to be something worth considering here. Kosinski has been careful to cover other bases as well; this doesn’t appear to be a statistical anomaly or exaggeration of an isolated result.The idea that your political party may be written on your face is an unnerving one, for while one’s political leanings are far from the most private of info, it’s also something that is very reasonably thought of as being intangible. People may choose to express their political beliefs with a hat, pin or t-shirt, but one generally considers one’s face to be nonpartisan.If you’re wondering which facial features in particular are revealing, unfortunately the system is unable to report that. In a sort of para-study, Kosinski isolated a couple dozen facial features (facial hair, directness of gaze, various emotions) and tested whether those were good predictors of politics, but none led to more than a small increase in accuracy over chance or human expertise.“Head orientation and emotional expression stood out: Liberals tended to face the camera more directly, were more likely to express surprise, and less likely to express disgust,” Kosinski wrote in author’s notes for the paper. But what they added left more than 10 percentage points of accuracy not accounted for: “That indicates that the facial recognition algorithm found many other features revealing political orientation.”Unregulated facial recognition technology presents unique risks for the LGBTQ+ communityThe knee-jerk defense of “this can’t be true — phrenology was snake oil” doesn’t hold much water here. It’s scary to think it’s true, but it doesn’t help us to deny what could be a very important truth, since it could be used against people very easily.As with the sexual orientation research, the point here is not to create a perfect detector for this information, but to show that it can be done in order that people begin to consider the dangers that creates. If for example an oppressive theocratic regime wanted to crack down on either non-straight people or those with a certain political leaning, this sort of technology gives them a plausible technological method to do so “objectively.” And what’s more, it can be done with very little work or contact with the target, unlike digging through their social media history or analyzing their purchases (also very revealing).We have already heard of China deploying facial recognition software to find members of the embattled Uyghur religious minority. And in our own country, this sort of AI is trusted by authorities as well — it’s not hard to imagine police using the “latest technology” to, for instance, classify faces at a protest, saying “these 10 were determined by the system as being the most liberal,” or what have you.The idea that a couple researchers using open-source software and a medium-sized database of faces (for a government, this is trivial to assemble in the unlikely possibility they do not have one already) could do so anywhere in the world, for any purpose, is chilling.“Don’t shoot the messenger,” said Kosinski. “In my work, I am warning against widely used facial recognition algorithms. Worryingly, those AI physiognomists are now being used to judge people’s intimate traits – scholars, policymakers, and citizens should take notice.”Portland passes expansive city ban on facial recognition tech']",took to Twitter,"['NavigationClose', 'Scientific Reports', 'Stanford University’s', 'Kosinski', 'Kosinski', 'Kosinski', 'AI', 'Kosinski', 'Kosinski', 'AI', 'Kosinski', 'Kosinski', 'Kosinski', 'AI', 'Kosinski', 'AI', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'UniversityFacial', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/bQQjPKHHCL,2021-01-13T17:56:48,Affirm doubles after starting to trade despite strong IPO pricing,"[""Today shares of Affirm, a buy-now-pay-later unicorn, started trading above $90 per share, far above its $49 per-share IPO price, a figure that was already miles above the company’s early expectations.The pop comes after Affirm raised its pricing range earlier this week, to $41 to $44 per share, up from an initial range of $33 to $38 per share. To see the company double from its raised price implies strong demand for its shares, a thin float, or both.Affirm’s explosive debut comes on the heels of similarly strong results from DoorDash, C3.ai and Airbnb. Those companies’ debuts were so strong that Roblox delayed its IPO, later swapping a traditional IPO for a direct listing to get around the pricing issue.IPO delays are bumming me outToday’s IPO shows that the same dynamics that were at play in those IPOs have persisted into 2021. More public debuts are expected in Q1, including Coinbase, another well-known unicorn. Other names like Robinhood, Bumble and others are in the wings.Affirm’s first-day performance will certainly raise eyebrows from regular critics of the traditional IPO process. But the company did raise more money than it perhaps anticipated, and is having a raucous first-day’s trading, so it’s hard to fret too much for the company. If its share price is still as high in a month as it is today, perhaps it was as underpriced as some will claim.FintechAffirm’s pricing brings a green splash to a busy week for fintech giants. Yesterday, Visa’s $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid failed to go through due to regulatory concerns. While the fallen deal could have a chilling effect on fintech startups, Plaid told TechCrunch that it saw 60% customer growth in 2020, bringing it to more than 4,000 clients. Plaid’s next step, per many in the VC and tech community, will be even bigger than its once-planned $5.3 billion dollar exit.Visa will not acquire Plaid after running into regulatory wallSome tweets here to give you a sense of the momentum around fintech right now:Imo, give a few years, they'll acquire Visa.— Shani Majer (@ClicWill2) January 12, 2021January of 2021 feels not very much different from January of 2020 for fintechFunding rounds announced by Blend, Mx (Utah!), Modern Treasury, Relay Payments (Atlanta!), Rapyd Payments, Checkout, Curve, Rho, Reggora etcPlaid news!

https://t.co/mrygbmaYTJ,2021-01-13T17:49:22,Flo gets FTC slap for sharing user data when it promised privacy,"['The FTC has reached a settlement with Flo, a period and fertility tracking app with 100 million+ users, over allegations it shared users’ health data with third-party app analytics and marketing services like Facebook despite promising to keep users’ sensitive health data private.Flo must obtain an independent review of its privacy practices and obtain app users’ consent before sharing their health information under the terms of the proposed settlement.The action follows a 2019 reports in the Wall Street Journal that conducted an analysis of a number of apps’ data sharing activity.It found the fertility tracking app had informed Facebook of in-app activity — such as when a user was having their period or had informed it of an intention to get pregnant. It did not find any way for Flo users to prevent their health information from being sent to Facebook.In the announcement of a proposed settlement today, the FTC said press coverage of Flo sharing users data with third-party app analytics and marketing firms including Facebook and Google had led to hundreds of complaints.The app only stopped leaking users’ health data following the negative press coverage, it added.Under the FTC settlement terms, Flo is prohibited from misrepresenting the purposes for which it (or entities to whom it discloses data) collect, maintain, use or disclose the data; how much consumers can control these data uses; its compliance with any privacy, security or compliance program; and how it collects, maintains, uses, discloses, deletes or protects users’ personal information.\xa0Flo must also notify affected users about the disclosure of their personal information and instruct any third party that received users’ health information to destroy that data.The app maker has been contacted for comment. Update: A Flo spokesperson said:“At Flo our highest priority is protecting our users’ data which is why we have cooperated fully throughout the FTC’s review of our privacy policy and procedures.\xa0“We understand that our users place trust in our technology to keep their sensitive information private and the responsibility we have to provide a safe and secure platform for them to use. That’s why it is our policy to provide security measures designed to protect individual user data and privacy rights. We are transparent about our data practices and adhere strictly to all applicable regulations.“Our agreement with the FTC is not an admission of any wrongdoing. Rather, it is a settlement to avoid the time and expense of litigation and enables us to decisively put this matter behind us.“Flo did not at any time share users’ names, addresses, or birthdays with anyone.\xa0 We do not currently, and will not, share any information about our users’ health with any company unless we get their permission.“We have a comprehensive privacy framework with a robust set of policies and procedures to safeguard our users’ data which are regularly reviewed both internally and using independent expert auditors.“We are glad to have reached an agreement with the FTC and resolved the matter. We will be conducting a compliance review into our policies and procedures as requested as part of the Consent Agreement and providing the FTC with regular updates. We are committed to ensuring that the privacy of our users’ personal health data is absolutely paramount”.No financial penalty is being levied but the FTC’s proposed settlement is noteworthy as it’s the first time the U.S. regulator has ordered notice of a privacy action.“Apps that collect, use and share sensitive health information can provide valuable services but consumers need to be able to trust these apps. We are looking closely at whether developers of health apps are keeping their promises and handling sensitive health information responsibly,” said Andrew Smith, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.While the settlement received unanimous backing from five commissioners, two — Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter — have issued a joint dissent statement in which they highlight the lack of a finding of a breach of a health breach notification rule that they argue should have applied in this case..@RKSlaughterFTC and I also believe that Flo violated the @FTC Health Breach Notification Rule.Congress directed the FTC to protect our sensitive health data through this rule, to complement HIPAA, but the agency has never brought an action under this rule. This should change.— Rohit Chopra (@chopraftc) January 13, 2021“In our view, the FTC should have charged Flo with violating the Health Breach Notification Rule. Under the rule, Flo was obligated to notify its users after it allegedly shared their health information with Facebook, Google and others without their authorization. Flo did not do so, making the company liable under the rule,” they write.“The Health Breach Notification Rule was first issued more than a decade ago, but the explosion in connected health apps make its requirements more important than ever. While we would prefer to see substantive limits on firms’ ability to collect and monetize our personal information, the rule at least ensures that services like Flo need to come clean when they experience privacy or security breaches. Over time, this may induce firms to take greater care in collecting and monetizing our most sensitive information,” they add.Flo is by no means the only period tracking app to have attracted attention for leaking user data in recent years.A report last year by the Norwegian Consumer Council found fertility/period tracker apps Clue and MyDays unexpectedly sharing data with adtech giants Facebook and Google, for example.Dating and fertility apps among those snitching to ‘out of control’ ad tech, report findsThat report also found similarly nontransparent data leaking going on across a range of apps, including dating, religious, make-up and kids apps — suggesting widespread breaches of regional data processing laws, which require that for consent to be valid users must be properly informed and given a genuine free choice. Although app makers have so far faced little enforcement for analytics/marketing-related data leaking in the region.In the U.S. regulatory action around apps hinges on misleading claims — whether about privacy (in Flo’s case) or in relation to the purposes of data processing, as in a separate settlement the FTC put out earlier this week related to cloud storage app Ever.FTC settlement with Ever orders data and AIs deleted after facial recognition pivot']",Drata,"['FTC', 'NavigationClose', 'FTC', 'Lomas@riptari', 'FTC', 'Flo', 'the Wall Street Journal', 'Flo', 'FTC', 'Flo', 'FTC', 'Flo', 'FTC', 'FTC', 'FTC', 'FTC', 'FTC', 'Andrew Smith', 'the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection', 'Rohit Chopra', 'Rebecca Kelly Slaughter', 'Flo', 'the @FTC', 'Congress', 'FTC', 'Rohit Chopra', 'FTC', 'Flo', 'the Health Breach Notification Rule', 'Flo', 'Flo', 'Flo', 'the Norwegian Consumer Council', 'Clue', 'MyDays', 'FTC', 'FTC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'dataprivacyFlo', 'FTC', 'FTC', 'Flo', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The New Taipei City, Taiwan-based company’s vacuum-assisted device can collect up to 150 to 500 microliters of blood from a finger prick, depending on the person, in about two minutes.Winnoz is currently presenting Haiim and eGGi, its molecular detection device that supports isothermal DNA/RNA amplification methods, at CES’ Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion, with the goal of finding new partners and investors.Haiim was inspired by founder and chief executive officer Joses Hsiung’s childhood memories of watching his mother go into clinics for regular blood testing. Since his mother’s veins were hard to see, it often took multiple punctures for phlebotomists to draw enough blood. Eventually, her veins collapsed. Hsiung began working on the device to maximize the amount of blood that can be taken from finger pricks.From crypto trading and home workouts to EV batteries and microLED displays, CES’ Taiwan startups cover a wide range of techWhile finger blood draws are typically used for tests that require less than 10 microliters of blood, like glucose monitoring or cholesterol panel, Haiim can draw enough for ones that need a larger volume, potentially helping patients avoid venipuncture blood draws.The device consists of two parts, the main unit and single-use cartridges that store the blood until it is tested. Because many clinics and hospitals are understaffed, it is designed so personnel can start using it with less training than traditional blood collection methods. Haiim was approved by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration in 2019 and is intended for use by healthcare organizations, clinics and hospitals.']",Openbase,"['Haiim', 'NavigationClose ScreenWinnoz’s', 'Haiim', 'Shu@catherineshu', 'Winnoz', 'window)Winnoz’s Haiim', 'The New Taipei City', 'Winnoz', 'Haiim', 'Taiwan Tech Arena', 'Haiim', 'Joses Hsiung’s', 'EV', 'Haiim', 'the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Haiim', '2021Winnoz’s Haiim', 'The New Taipei City', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The platform can fully automate some processes, such as buying online ads.To illustrate what it can accomplish, Tradeswell pointed to the work it did with a personal care brand on Amazon Prime Day, with total sales doubling versus the previous Prime Day and profits increasing 67%.The startup has now raised a total of $18.8 million. The Series A was led by SignalFire, which also led Tradeswell’s seed round, while Construct Capital, Allen & Company and The Emerson Group also participated.Millennial Media’s Paul Palmieri launches Tradeswell, a startup promising to fix e-commerce margins“With the explosion of ecommerce over the past year, Tradeswell is perfectly positioned to help brands manage the complexity of online sales across an ever-increasing number of platforms and marketplaces,” said SignalFire founder and CEO Chris Farmer in a statement. “Paul and his team bring together a unique blend of experience in data, marketing and logistics to address the challenges of today and a rapidly evolving market in the years ahead with a central command center to optimize profitable growth.”Palmieri said the new funding will allow Tradeswell to continue investing in the product, which will also mean building more integrations so that more types of data become “more liquid,” which in turn means that the platform can “make much more real-time decisions.”When Tradeswell launched publicly last fall, it already had 100 customers, and Palmieri told me that number has subsequently grown past 150. Nor does he expect the consumer shift in e-commerce to disappear once the pandemic ends.“Some of it probably goes back to the way it was, some of it stays online,” he said. “I do think it’s important to point out there’s something in the middle — that something is this notion of high convenience, that is semi-brick-and-mortar with [elements of e-commerce], whether that’s mobile ordering or something like an Instacart.”Naturally, he sees Tradeswell as the key platform to help businesses navigate that shift.Why e-commerce startups aren’t raising more funding during this historic boom\xa0']",Iziwork,"['Tradeswell', 'NavigationClose', 'Tradeswell', 'Tradeswell', 'Paul Palmieri', 'Millennial Media', 'TechCrunch', 'Verizon Media', 'Tradeswell', 'Amazon Prime Day', 'SignalFire', 'Tradeswell’s', 'Construct Capital', 'Allen & Company', 'The Emerson Group', 'Millennial Media’s', 'Paul Palmieri', 'Tradeswell', 'Tradeswell', 'SignalFire', 'Chris Farmer', 'Tradeswell', 'Tradeswell', 'Palmieri', 'Instacart', 'Tradeswell', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagseCommerceFundingFundings & ExitsRecent', 'Tradeswell', 'Tradeswell', 'Paul Palmieri', 'Millennial Media', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/zP4QJ3Sx5i,2021-01-13T17:03:01,Drata raises $3.2M for its compliance audit platform,"['Drata, a startup that helps businesses get their SOC 2 compliance, today announced that it has raised a $3.2 million seed round led by Cowboy Ventures and that it is coming out of stealth. Other investors include Leaders Fund, SV Angel and a group of angel investors.Like similar services, Drata helps businesses automate a lot of the evidence collection as they prepare for a SOC 2 audit. The focus of the service is obviously on running tests against the SOC 2 framework to help businesses prepare for their audit (and to prepare the right materials for the auditor). To do so, it features integrations with a lot of standard online business tools and cloud services to regularly pull in data. One nifty feature is that it also lets you step through all of the various sections of the SOC 2 criteria to check your current readiness for an audit.At the end of the day, tools like Drata are meant to get you through an audit, but at the same time, the idea here is also to give you a better idea of your own security posture. For that, Drata offers continuous control monitoring, as well as tools to track if your employees have turned on all the right controls on their work computers, for example. Because companies have to regularly renew their certification, too, Drata can help them to continuously collect all of the data for their renewal, something that previously often involved boring — and quickly forgotten — manual tasks, like taking screenshots of various settings every month or so.Image Credits: DrataDrata co-founder and CEO Adam Markowitz worked on the space shuttle engines after graduating from college, and then launched his own startup, Portfolium, when that program ended. Portfolium, which helped students showcase their work in the form of — you guessed it — a portfolio, eventually sold to Instructure in 2019, where Markowitz stayed on until he launched Drata last June, together with a group of former Portfolium founders and engineers. Besides Markowitz, the co-founders include CTO Daniel Marashlian and CRO Troy Markowitz. It was the team’s experience seeing companies go through the audit process, which has traditionally been a drawn-out and manual process, that led them to look at building their own solution.The company already managed to sign up a number of customers ahead of its official launch. These include Spot by NetApp,\xa0Accel Robotics,\xa0Abnormal Security,\xa0Chameleon and Vareto. As Markowitz told me, even though Drata already had customers that were using the service to prepare for their audits, the team wanted to remain in stealth mode until it had used its own tool to go through its own audit. With that out of the way, and Drata receiving its SOC 2 certification, it’s now ready to come out of stealth.As the number of companies that need to go through these kinds of audits increases, it’s maybe no surprise that we’re also seeing a growing number of companies that aim to automate much of this process. With that, unsurprisingly, the number of VC investments in this space also continues to increase.

https://t.co/PPndljPywF,2021-01-13T17:00:04,Openbase scores $3.6M seed to help developers find open-source components,"['Openbase founder Lior Grossman started his company the way that many founders do — to solve a problem he was having. In this case, it was finding the right open-source components to build his software. He decided to build something to solve the problem, and Openbase was born.Today, the company announced a $3.65 million seed round led by Zeev Ventures with participation from Y Combinator and 20 individual tech industry investors. Openbase was a member of the YC 2020 cohort.Grossman says that being part of YC helped him meet investors, especially on Demo Day when hundreds of investors listened in. “I would say that being part of YC definitely gave us a higher profile, and exposed us to some investors that I didn’t know before. It definitely opened doors for us,” he said.As developers build modern software, they often use open-source components to help build the application, and Openbase helps them find the best one for their purposes. “Openbase basically helps developers choose from among millions of open-source packages,” Grossman told me.The database includes 1.5 million JavaScript packages today, with support for additional languages including Python and Go in beta. The way it works is that users search for a package based on their requirements and get a set of results. From there, they can compare components and judge them based on user reviews and other detailed insights.Image Credits: OpenbaseGrossman found that his idea began resonating with developers shortly after he launched in 2019. In fact, he reports that he went from zero to half a million users in the first year without any marketing beyond word of mouth. That’s when he decided to apply to Y Combinator and got into the Summer 2020 class.The database is free for developers, and that has helped build the user base so quickly. Eventually he hopes to monetize by allowing certain companies to promote their packages on the system. He says that these will be clearly marked and that the plan is to have only one promoted package per category. What’s more, they will retain all their user reviews and other associated data, regardless of whether it’s being promoted or not.Grossman started the company on his own, but has added five employees, with plans to hire more people this year to keep growing the startup. As an immigrant founder, he is sensitive to diversity and sees building a diverse company as a key goal. “I built this company as an immigrant myself […] and I want to build an inclusive culture with people from different backgrounds because I think that will produce the best environment to foster innovation,” he explained.So far the company has been fully remote, but the plan is to open an office post-pandemic. He says he sees a highly flexible approach to work, though, with people spending some days in the office and some at home. “I think for our culture this hybrid approach will work.

Cathay Innovation and Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund are participating in this funding round. The company has been building a platform focused on improving temporary employment.While it’s a relatively large funding round, the startup is quite young. It was founded in September 2018 and it has raised $68 million overall.Iziwork manages a marketplace of temporary work; 2,000 companies are using the platform in France and Italy, and 800,000 candidates have used the app to access job opportunities. You can consider it as a tech-enabled version of the good old employment agency.Candidates can onboard directly from the mobile app. You then get personalized recommendations based on your profile (95% of assignments are filled in less than four hours). And of course, all your documents are managed from the app.Iziwork tries to add some benefits to compensate for the fact that temporary workers often jump from one company to another. For instance, you get a time savings account, you can request a down payment on your pay every week, etc.The startup has realized that it can’t open offices in every big and intermediate city. That’s why third-party companies can join the Iziwork network. As a partner, you find new clients and new job opportunities. You can then leverage Iziwork’s app, service and pool of candidates.This is an interesting strategy, as it greatly increases supply on the Iziwork marketplace. Partners get a revenue sharing deal with Iziwork.With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to new countries and improve its tech product. There are still some growth opportunities in its existing markets as well.Jobandtalent, another company in this space, has attracted some headlines as it raised $108 million last week. Founded in 2009 and based in Madrid, it generated €500 million in revenue last year.But, let’s be honest, the temporary work market is huge. Adecco, Randstad and other legacy players still represent a bigger threat for this recent wave of temp staffing startups.

This is a big one for the Jeff Bezos-founded space company, too — it includes upgrades to the crew capsule atop the rocket that are designed to improve the astronaut experience, a key preparatory step as the company approaches its first actual human spaceflight missions.New Shepard has flown 13 times, and carried a number of different payloads to suborbital space before returning to Earth. The reusable launch vehicle aims to ultimately provide rides to space for people, too — and while there’s no stated timeline for this actually happening, tomorrow’s mission is a strong sign that it could be taking place sometime relatively soon.Crew-focused upgrades flying on this New Shepard launch for the first time include acoustic and temperature regulation equipment, display panels that provide information to anyone who would be on board and push-to-talk communications systems installed in each of the crew capsule’s six seats. One of those seats will have a life-sized humanoid flight dummy named Mannequin Skywalker that Blue Origin uses to measure various aspects of the vehicle’s performance.It’ll test astronaut safety alert systems that Blue Origin intends to include on the final flight system, and it’ll also carry a payload with a very different purpose — 50,000 postcards provided to the Blue Origin nonprofit Club for the Future by school kids around the world.Blue Origin successfully launches and lands New Shepard, with a first-ever external booster payloadThe mission will be broadcast live by Blue Origin via its website and YouTube channel (embedded below) and you can expect the stream to begin around 30 minutes prior to launch time, so at around 10:15 AM EST (7:15 AM PST).']",NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program,"['Blue Origin', 'New Shepard', 'NavigationClose ScreenBlue Origin', 'New Shepard', 'Etherington@etherington', 'Blue OriginBlue Origin', 'New Shepard', 'Mannequin Skywalker', 'Blue Origin', 'Blue Origin', 'Blue Origin', 'Club for the Future', 'Blue Origin', 'New Shepard', 'Blue Origin', 'YouTube', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'New Shepard', 'New Shepard', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/pJ2ftPMY0g,2021-01-13T15:48:43,Wall Street hugs Affirm as it starts life as a public company,"['And we’re off to the races!Last night, Affirm priced its IPO above its raised range at $49 per share, a sign that the public markets remain hungry for new listings. Provided that Affirm today trades similarly to how it priced, we could be looking at a 2021 IPO market that resembles last year’s heated results.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.That’s good news for a host of companies looking to follow in the financial technology unicorn’s footsteps.Poshmark prices tonight and trades tomorrow. With Qualtrics in the wings along with Coinbase, Roblox set to direct list, and Bumble said to file as well, we’re heading into another busy IPO quarter. Affirm’s first-day trading results will therefore hold extra importance, even if its pricing augurs well for IPOs more generally.Affirm first targeted $33 to $38 per share\xa0before raising its range to $41 to $44 per share. Pricing at $49 is a victory. Briefly, why, and then a thought about what’s next for the IPO market.AffirmWhat does Affirm sell? First, per its S-1 filings, it charges merchants a fee to “convert a sale and power a payment.” That sounds like software revenues, albeit not in the recurring manner of a SaaS company.Second, Affirm earns from “interest income [from] the simple interest loans that we purchase from our originating bank partners.” And, it offers virtual cards to consumers via its app, allowing it to generate interchange revenues.We care about all of that as it’s important to realize that Affirm is\xa0not\xa0a software company in the context that we usually think about them, namely software as a service, or SaaS.This matters when we consider how the market values Affirm; the more richly Affirm is valued in revenue-multiple terms by its new, $49 per-share IPO price, the more bullish we can presume the IPO market is.What are Affirm’s gross margins? A great question, and one that is surprisingly hard to answer. If you read its final S-1 filing, you’ll find that all its chatter concerning “contribution profit” has been removed. This is a shame to some degree as contribution profit — and margin — were Affirm’s closest shared cognate to gross margin.']",Share on Twitter ,"['Affirm', 'Affirm', 'Nigel Sussman', 'Affirm', 'Affirm', 'Exchange', 'Exchange', 'Qualtrics', 'Roblox', 'Affirm’s', 'Affirm', 'Affirm', 'Affirm', 'Affirm', 'Affirm', 'Affirm’s', 'Affirm’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFinanceFundings &', 'Affirm', 'Alex Wilhelm4:48', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/AsVII9DIrK,2021-01-13T15:34:42,Vdoo raises $25M more to develop its AI-based security for IoT and connected devices,"['It’s estimated that there were some 50 billion connected devices globally in 2020, and while that really says a lot about how far we’ve come in tech, for many it also speaks to a big issue: security vulnerabilities, with the devices themselves, plus all the components and services running on them, all potential targets for anything from malicious hackers to not-so-intentional data leaks.Today, Israeli startup Vdoo — which has been developing AI-based services to detect and fix those kinds of vulnerabilities in IoT devices — is announcing $25 million in funding, money that it plans to use to help it better address the wider issue as it applies to all connected objects.With its initial focus on large industrial deployments, medical systems, communications infrastructure and automotive, Vdoo also is looking more deeply now at the wider network of devices that use communications chips, providing quick (as in minutes) assessments to identify and remediate or directly fix various issues: it cites zero-day vulnerabilities, CVEs, configuration and hardening issues, and standard incompliances among them.The funding — an extension to the $32 million round that Vdoo announced in April 2019 — is coming from two investors, Israel’s Qumra Capital and Verizon Ventures (the investing arm of Verizon, which — by way of its acquisition of Aol many years ago — also owns TechCrunch).VDOO secures $32M for a platform that uses AI to detect and fix vulnerabilities on IoT devicesVerizon’s interest in Vdoo is strategic and speaks to the opportunity in the market.As CEO Netanel Davidi (who co-founded the company with Uri Alter and Asaf Karas) describes it, operators like Verizon are interested because of their role as a distributer and reseller of hardware as part of their wider services play, be it for broadband access, or a telematics service or something for the connected home or connected office.“They sell connected devices to enterprises and home users that are not made by them, yet the carriers are responsible for the security,” he said, “so the solution is to bake that into devices” to make it work more seamlessly, he said. Verizon is not the startup’s only strategic backer. Others in the first tranche of this round included another carrier, Japan’s NTT Docomo, MS&AD Ventures (the venture arm of the global cyber insurance firm) and Dell Technology Capital, the VC arm of Dell.The company has now raised around $70 million, and while it’s not disclosing valuation, Davidi confirmed that it has more than doubled this year.(In April 2019, PitchBook estimated that it was just under $100 million, which would make it now at over $200 million if that figure is accurate.)Davidi said that the decision to raise this money as an extension to the previous round rather than a new round was strategic: it gave the company the chance to raise funding more quickly, and to take more time to prepare for a bigger funding round in the near future.And the reason for raising quickly was to address what was a quickly moving target: One of the by-products of the COVID-19 pandemic has been a dramatic shift to people working from home, buying new devices to enable that and in general using their communications networks much more heavily than before.Connected-device security typically focuses on monitoring activity on the hardware, how data is moving in and out of it. Vdoo’s approach has been to build a platform that monitors the behavior of the devices themselves, using AI to compare that behavior to identify when something is not working as it should.\xa0“For any kind of vulnerability, using deep binary analysis capabilities, we try to understand the broader idea, to figure out how a similar vulnerability can emerge,” is how Davidi described the process when we talked about the first part of this round back in 2019.Vdoo generates specific “tailor-made on-device micro-agents” to continue the detection and repair process, which Davidi likens to a modern approach to some cancer care: preventive measures such as periodic monitoring checks, followed by a “tailored immunotherapy” based on prior analysis of DNA.As Davidi described it to me this week, the platform “analyzes the device software, uncovers all of its security flaws, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities, prioritizes them by their criticality, and offers ways to remediate them.” Vdoo’s analysis considers the complete device context and treats several other factors like configuration, OS, drivers, etc. to accurately reflect a holistic view of the device’s security posture. Then, based on the results of the analysis, “it can automatically generate an on-device agent that provides ongoing monitoring and protection.”Vdoo is a play on the Hebrew word that sounds like “vee-doo” and means “making sure”, and points to the basic idea of how it approaches the verification around its device monitoring. It also feels somewhat like the next step in endpoint security, which was the focus of Davidi and Alter’s previous startup, Cyvera, which was eventually acquired by Palo Alto Networks.The focus on devices, in some ways, is a significantly more complex approach, given that it’s not just about the device, but the many components that go into them. As we have seen with Meltdown and Spectre, vulnerabilities might exist at the processor level.And as Davidi pointed out to me this week, at times those issues aren’t even intentional but still mean data can leak out, and at worst that can be exploitable by bad actors.“Backdoors are being built into many devices, and some are not even intentional,” he said. “It may be that the developer wanted to create a shortcut to make something else easier in the future. Some will see that as a back door, and some will not.”The fractal-like nature of the issue is what Vdoo is digging into with its widening approach.“Initially we wanted to serve the ecosystem of manufacturers, since they are the cause of the problem and the origin of the security issues,” he said. “We started there with Fortune 500 customers in areas like automotive and industrial and medical and telco and aviation. The idea was to make a platform that could serve and protect security stakeholders. But then we saw that this was a big unserved market.”Indeed, Vdoo quotes figures from research firm MarketsandMarkets that forecast that the global device security market will grow to $36.6 billion by 2025 from $12.5 billion in 2020.“The number of connected IoT devices is rapidly growing, creating greater opportunities for security breaches,” said Boaz Dinte, managing partner of Qumra Capital, in a statement. “Vdoo’s unique device-centric, deep technology automated approach has already brought immediate value to vendors in a very short period of time. We believe the market opportunity is huge, and with newly infused growth capital, Vdoo is well-positioned to become the leading global player for securing connected devices.”“With the expansion of 5G networks and mobile edge compute, there’s a need for an end-to-end, device-centric security approach to IoT,” added Verizon Ventures MD Tammy Mahn in a statement. “As the venture arm of a leading telco, Verizon Ventures is proud to invest in Vdoo and its world-class team on their journey to solve this global need, while ushering in a new era of security by design in our increasingly connected world.”']",extensively profiled on its launch after raising $53 million in a Series A,"['AI', 'IoT', 'NavigationClose', 'AI', 'IoT', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'your_photo', 'Getty Images', 'Royalty', 'Vdoo', 'AI', 'Vdoo', 'Verizon Ventures', 'Aol', 'TechCrunch).VDOO', 'AI', 'Netanel Davidi', 'Uri Alter', 'Verizon', 'NTT Docomo', 'MS&AD Ventures', 'Dell Technology Capital', 'VC', 'Davidi', 'PitchBook', 'Vdoo’s', 'AI', 'Davidi', 'Vdoo’s', 'Davidi', 'Alter’s', 'Cyvera', 'Palo Alto Networks', 'Meltdown', 'Davidi', 'Vdoo', 'Vdoo', 'MarketsandMarkets', 'IoT', 'Boaz Dinte', 'Qumra Capital', 'Vdoo’s', 'IoT', 'Verizon Ventures', 'MD Tammy Mahn', 'Verizon Ventures', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CapitalsecurityStartupsvdooVerizon VenturesVdoo', 'AI', 'IoT', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

How will this new process work?— Positive in Palo AltoDear Positive:Thanks for your timely question! The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), finalized a new rule last week (Jan. 8), that replaces the random H-1B lottery with a pay-to-play system. There may be litigation that could change things before this year’s selection process, but interestingly, removing the randomness from the H-1B lottery is one point on which both Biden and Trump agree.To find out more about all the changes that will impact this year’s H-1B process and how to prepare, register for our upcoming webinar on Jan. 20, on how to Get Ready for the H-1B FY2022 Lottery. In the meantime, listen to my recent H-1B podcast in which I discuss what the 2021 lottery will look like, and download our free H-1B guide. Also, check out the podcast episode on What Makes a Strong H-1B Petition.Under this new wage-based H-1B allocation system, which is slated to go into effect on March 9, USCIS will select H-1B registrants based on the highest relative wages paid, taking into account the job, where it will be done and the job level (think of it like a career stage). This change is aimed at encouraging employers to offer higher salaries and higher-skilled positions to H-1B candidates to better protect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers and increase the likelihood that H-1B visas will be awarded to the best and the brightest individuals. In a nutshell, this is great news for Silicon Valley companies that have cash and need to remove risk.While the new rule substantially increases predictability in the “lottery” process, it may make it more difficult for companies that are unfunded, pre-revenue early-stage startups to get H-1B visas for founders or employees, particularly since other forms of compensation, such as equity or stock options, are not considered wages. So the lesson here is to get some predictable revenue or runway prior to Q2 when you need to submit the I-129 petition so you can demonstrate the “ability to pay” at a higher wage level.']",released its first-ever diversity and inclusion report,"['H-1B', 'H-1B', 'Sophie AlcornSophie AlcornContributorShare', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Sophie', 'Sophie', 'Sophie Alcorn', 'H-1B', 'The Department of Homeland Security', 'U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services', 'Biden', 'Trump', 'H-1B', 'H-1B', 'H-1B', 'USCIS', 'H-1B', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsColumnDiversityLaborLawyersPolicyStartupsVerified Expertsgreen cardH-1Bimmigration lawSophie AlcornWorkextra-crunch-', 'H-1B', 'H-1B', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/mQmlttjfXx,2021-01-13T15:23:03,Two-year-old NUVIA sells to Qualcomm for $1.4 billion,"['You know what’s great? Becoming a unicorn in two years. You know what’s even better? Exiting at unicorn status in two years.This morning, Qualcomm announced that it was buying high-performance computing startup NUVIA for $1.4 billion, minus some coverage of working capital and debt.The startup, which we extensively profiled on its launch after raising $53 million in a Series A in late 2019 and again a few months ago when it raised $240 million in its Series B from Mithril, was the brainchild of a number of star Apple chip engineers who had worked on the computing giant’s A series of chips that powered the company’s iPhones and iPads.Much like how Apple’s new M series of chips for its laptop computers (so far) have dazzled with an almost revolutionary mix of energy efficiency and performance, NUVIA’s founders were hoping to use their experience in managing the power envelope while eking out high performance and bringing that to the data center. Given the sheer scale of power required by data centers to function, which is only going up with the demand for AI applications in the cloud, the hope was that NUVIA could have its cake and eat it too: offering high performance while cutting power and saving costs for cloud computing.Three of Apple and Google’s former star chip designers launch NUVIA with $53M in series A fundingAccording to Qualcomm’s press release, NUVIA’s technology will be incorporated across the company’s line of chips, with its leadership centered around its 5G-focused Snapdragon chip. The company’s founders and employees are expected to join, and the deal must be approved by U.S. regulators.NUVIA was one of the most compelling companies of the new crop of next-generation silicon startups, but it was also mired in a legal battle between one of its founders and famed former Apple engineer Gerald Williams III and his former employer. Apple filed a civil lawsuit against Williams in 2019 (California Superior Court of Santa Clara, 19-cv-352866), arguing that he attempted to recruit his former colleagues to join NUVIA in breach of his contractual obligations with Apple. Williams fought back through his own motions, and the two have been in legal discovery ever since, with the latest updates happening just last month with Apple and Williams demanding each other hand over certain documents as the case has proceeded.We don’t know how the timing of that lawsuit played into the company’s quick exit, or whether Qualcomm’s significantly deeper relationship with Apple as a supplier might help the parties reach a quicker settlement. We’ve reached out to a NUVIA spokesperson for comment.While that lawsuit was a cloud over the company, the end result is a unicorn exit at $1.4 billion on just shy of $300 million of venture capital fundraised in roughly two years. Mithril is probably not terribly thrilled given the quick turnaround, but earlier investors like Capricorn Investment Group, Dell Technologies Capital (DTC), Mayfield and WRVI Capital are probably doing a bit better on the multiples on invested capital front. And of course, the founders likely came out well ahead as well.NUVIA raises $240M from Mithril to make climate-ready enterprise chips']",Stacklet,"['NUVIA', 'Qualcomm', 'NavigationClose', 'NUVIA', 'Qualcomm', 'Artystarty', 'Getty ImagesYou', 'Qualcomm', 'NUVIA', 'Mithril', 'Apple', 'iPhones', 'iPads', 'Apple’s', 'NUVIA', 'AI', 'NUVIA', 'Apple', 'NUVIA', 'NUVIA', 'Snapdragon', 'NUVIA', 'Apple', 'Gerald Williams III', 'Apple', 'Williams', 'California Superior Court', 'NUVIA', 'Apple', 'Williams', 'Apple', 'Williams', 'Qualcomm’s', 'Apple', 'NUVIA', 'Mithril', 'Capricorn Investment Group', 'Dell Technologies Capital', 'DTC', 'Mayfield', 'WRVI Capital', 'NUVIA', 'Mithril', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'NUVIA', 'Qualcomm', 'Qualcomm', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/QpXouNanYS,2021-01-13T15:16:10,Gainful raises $7.5M for personalized sports nutrition,"['Gainful, a startup offering personalized subscriptions to protein powders and hydration products, is announcing that it has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding.COO Eric Wu, who founded the company with CTO Jahaan Ansari, told me that Gainful began with his own experience experimenting with different protein powders and eventually finding the combination that worked best for his goals and dietary needs.“In my personal experience, trying to find a protein powder can be a very overwhelming experience,” Wu said. “There are a million ingredients, and you just want somebody to talk to who can cut through all that noise.”So when when you first sign up for Gainful, you take a quiz about things like your height, weight, exercise patterns, fitness goals and how often you plan to consume the protein product. The company will then recommend a powder for you, as well as providing ongoing access to a registered dietitian who can answer any additional questions.Wu said that behind the scenes, Gainful developed “hundreds and hundreds of different [protein] blends,” then worked with its science advisory board (which includes nutrition experts who have worked with the Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings) to “hone in on a set number of blends.” When asked for more details about how many products the company is actually selling, Wu said it’s “more than a handful” and they’re “constantly being iterated on.”Image Credits: GainfulAll Gainful products are made without artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners, and they’re gluten-free and soy-free as well. With the new electrolyte drink mixes (which I’ve tried and enjoyed), the startup is moving beyond protein, and Wu said it will continue to add new products and new flavors. At the same time, you still need a subscription to the protein powder (pricing starts at $39) to get access to additional products.To explain this relatively high commitment approach, Wu said, “We really believe that we’ve created a system of products that all have complementary benefits and work really synergistically. If you’re hydrating properly, you can work harder during your exercise, and your personalized protein powder is working harder for you. All of these are offered … not as a magic bullet, not as a lose-weight-fast solution, but as a way of being healthy. It’s not supposed to be a flash in the pan.”The Series A round was co-led by BrandProject and Courtside Ventures, with participation from AF Ventures, Round13 Capital, Barrel Ventures and the founder of Polaris Sports.Gainful was part of Y Combinator’s winter 2018 batch. It also had a leadership transition early last year, with Wu shifting from CEO to COO (where he said he could focus more on product development), while Dean Kelly joined as chief executive.Wu added that the company has seen significant growth during the pandemic, due to the general shift toward e-commerce, as well as “people reflecting on what it means to lead a full, healthy, happy life in a time when it was really difficult.”Cure Hydration raises $2.6M for its healthy sports drink alternative']",sold his instant messaging app to the social juggernaut,"['NavigationClose ScreenGainful', 'GainfulGainful', 'COO Eric Wu', 'CTO Jahaan Ansari', 'Wu', 'Wu', 'Gainful', 'Wu', 'GainfulAll Gainful', 'Wu', 'Wu', 'BrandProject', 'Courtside Ventures', 'AF Ventures', 'Round13 Capital', 'Barrel Ventures', 'Polaris Sports', 'Gainful', 'Y Combinator’s', 'Wu', 'COO', 'Dean Kelly', 'Wu', 'Hydration', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkCopy Share', 'FundingSportsStartupsTCAF Venturesbrandprojectcourtside', 'drinkStartupsY CombinatorGainful', 'COO Eric Wu', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/QZ91Joum36,2021-01-13T15:02:11,Dell’s 40-inch curved monitor is perfect for a home office command center,"['Dell’s kicking off 2021 with a new addition to its monitor lineup that aims to hit a variety of sweet spots. The Dell UltraSharp 40 Curved WUHD monitor offers 39.7″ of screen real estate, with a 5120 x 2160 resolution that matches the pixel density of 4K resolution on a 32-inch conventional widescreen display. It comes equipped with Thunderbolt 3 for display and data connectivity, as well as 90W of charging for compatible computers, and a 10Gbps Ethernet connection for networking. In short, Dell’s latest (which is available beginning January 28) looks to be a true “one display to rule them all” contender, particularly for those searching for a way to optimize their home offices.The basicsDell’s UltraSharp 40 has a 60Hz, 39.7″ diagonal display in 21:9 aspect ratio with WUHD resolution (not quite true 5K, but exceptional for a curved monitor this size). It offers 100% sRGB and 98% P3 color reproduction, and comes with a stand that has height adjustability, tilt and swivel, and that features a hidden cable channel for cable management. Built-in speakers provide 9W each of sound reproduction so you don’t need to worry about adding externals.Image Credits: Darrell EtheringtonIn terms of wired connections, it offers Thunderbolt 3, RJ45 Ethernet and USB 10Gps ports (three on the rear, and one in front), as well as one USB-C port for easy access on the front. There’s also a 3.5mm audio line out (though it’s worth noting that this doesn’t work with headphones), and two HDMI ports plus one DisplayPort for more traditional display connectivity if you’re not going the Thunderbolt route. Finally, a standard security lock slot allows you to anchor the display in any shared environment.The display itself is bright, clear and viewable at a wide range of angles, with a more matte finish that provides excellent viewing in a wide range of lighting conditions. A joystick control button provides easy navigation and operation of the built-in on-screen menu and integrated features, including picture-in-picture.Design and featuresFirst and foremost, the Dell UltraSharp 40 delivered excellent visual quality. Especially for a display this size, in a curved form factor, at this resolution, it’s going to be something that satisfies everyone, from telecommuters mostly handling meetings and spreadsheets, to photographers and video professionals looking for image quality that is highly color-accurate and provides crystal-clear detail.The WUHD resolution means that you can run the display in a range of different configurations, depending on how much screen real estate you want or need. For instance, I’ve been using it at the 5160 x 2160 res, and it provides ample workspace for arranging multiple windows side-by-side, and tiled vertically. I typically use three displays at once in my day job (there’s a lot of tab and browser windows involved) and the Dell UltraSharp 40 makes it so that I can comfortably work with just a single monitor instead. It’ll work with Apple’s HiDPI modes on its modern Macs for clear and crisp visuals with larger on-screen elements, too, if you don’t need all that room.Dell’s integrated stand is simple and effective, providing a range of maneuverability options that allow for significant travel in height adjustment. You won’t get a portrait mode full swivel in this display — but that’s not surprising, given how long it is on its longest edge, compared to the vertical. You do get tilt if you need it, and the ability to angle back and forward depending on how you have it positioned. The end result is a display that’s very large, but easy enough to adjust for your comfortable use.Image Credits: Darrell EtheringtonThe display comes calibrated out of the box, but also includes plenty of options for adjusting things like contrast and brightness using the built-in menus. This also includes a very useful multi-device display setup, including both picture-in-picture features for multiple sources, and a picture-by-picture mode that splits the display into two equal side-by-side sections for multiple inputs. Another useful feature for working with the display with multiple computers: keyboards and mice connected via the monitor will automatically detect and switch between controlling both connected PCs.Besides the display size and resolution, the other thing that makes the UltraSharp 40 a fantastic option for a home workstation is its range of ports and added bonuses like built-in speakers. The speakers aren’t going to win any audiophile awards, but they’re better than the ones that come built into your laptop and they obviate the need for additional equipment if you’re looking to spare your desk surface space. With any modern Thunderbolt-equipped Mac, the Dell UltraSharp 40 really is a one-cable wonder that offers very little in the way of compromises.Bottom lineImage Credits: Darrell EtheringtonWith the Dell UltraSharp 40, the company continues its tradition of delivering extremely high-quality display products at a reasonable price. The $2,100 price tag may seem steep, but for what you’re getting it’s a very fair price point, and Dell’s displays also have very high reliability that means an investment in their monitors is likely to keep you satisfied for many years to come (two of my home office displays are some of Dell’s very first 4K monitors, which have served me reliably for over half a decade).Because of its wide aspect ratio and curve, this display really does replace two smaller 4K screens for most uses, and so the cost framed that way actually makes even more sense. In short, Dell’s UltraSharp 40 is a home office beast, which fills a sweet spot for a wide range of remote professionals.How to do remote work right, from the teams that know it best']",Webflow,"['Dell’s', 'NavigationClose', 'Etherington@etherington', 'Darrell EtheringtonDell’s', 'WUHD', 'Dell’s', 'WUHD', 'Darrell EtheringtonIn', 'Thunderbolt 3', 'USB', 'DisplayPort', 'Thunderbolt', 'WUHD', 'Apple’s', 'Dell’s', 'Darrell', 'Mac', 'Dell’s', 'Dell’s', 'Dell’s UltraSharp', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Etherington4:02', 'WUHD', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Though, it’s not the first time Netflix has shared this type of data. Netflix has shared representation numbers since 2013, but the company had not put a bow on it until now.Worldwide, women make up 47.1% of Netflix’s workforce. Since 2017, representation of white and Asian employees has been on a slow decline, while representation of Hispanic or Latinx, Black, mixed race and folks from native populations has been on the rise. In the U.S., Netflix is 8.1% Hispanic or Latinx, 8% Black and 5.1% of its employees are mixed race, while 1.3% of employees are either Native American, Native Alaskan, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and/or from the Middle East or North Africa.Netflix’s representation of people of color at the leadership level is not perfect, but it’s certainly better than that of its counterparts in the tech industry. The company’s leadership team is 15.7% Asian, 9.5% Black, 4.9% Hispanic and 4.1% of Netflix’s higher-ups are mixed race.Netflix has not laid out any concrete goals, but says it’s generally wanting to increase representation by hiring more inclusively and building out its recruiting networks, its VP of inclusion and diversity, Vernā Myers, said in the report.

https://t.co/vEoEgKOnpt,2021-01-13T14:30:15,Stacklet raises $18M for its cloud governance platform,"['Stacklet, a startup that is commercializing the\xa0Cloud Custodian open-source cloud governance project, today announced that it has raised an $18 million Series A funding round. The round was led by Addition, with participation from Foundation Capital\xa0and new individual investor\xa0Liam Randall, who is joining the company as VP of business development. Addition and Foundation Capital also invested in Stacklet’s seed round, which the company announced last August. This new round brings the company’s total funding to $22 million.Stacklet helps enterprises manage their data governance stance across different clouds, accounts, policies and regions, with a focus on security, cost optimization and regulatory compliance. The service offers its users a set of pre-defined policy packs that encode best practices for access to cloud resources, though users can obviously also specify their own rules. In addition, Stacklet offers a number of analytics functions around policy health and resource auditing, as well as a real-time inventory and change management logs for a company’s cloud assets.The company was co-founded by Travis Stanfield (CEO) and Kapil Thangavelu (CTO). Both bring a lot of industry expertise to the table. Stanfield spent time as an engineer at Microsoft and leading DealerTrack Technologies, while Thangavelu worked at Canonical and most recently in Amazon’s AWSOpen team. Thangavelu is also one of the co-creators of the Cloud Custodian project, which was first incubated at Capital One, where the two co-founders met during their time there, and is now a sandbox project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s umbrella.“When I joined Capital One, they had made the executive decision to go all-in on cloud and close their data centers,” Thangavelu told me. “I got to join on the ground floor of that movement and Custodian was born as a side project, looking at some of the governance and security needs that large regulated enterprises have as they move into the cloud.”As companies have sped up their move to the cloud during the pandemic, the need for products like Stacklets has also increased. The company isn’t naming most of its customers, but it has disclosed FICO a design partner. Stacklet isn’t purely focused on the enterprise, though. “Once the cloud infrastructure becomes — for a particular organization — large enough that it’s not knowable in a single person’s head, we can deliver value for you at that time and certainly, whether it’s through the open source or through Stacklet, we will have a story there.” The Cloud Custodian open-source project is already seeing serious use among large enterprises, though, and Stacklet obviously benefits from that as well.“In just 8 months, Travis and Kapil have gone from an idea to a functioning team with 15 employees, signed early Fortune 2000 design partners and are well on their way to building the Stacklet commercial platform,” Foundation Capital’s Sid Trivedi said. “They’ve done all this while sheltered in place at home during a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic. This is the type of velocity that investors look for from an early-stage company.”Looking ahead, the team plans to use the new funding to continue to developed the product, which should be generally available later this year, expand both its engineering and its go-to-market teams and continue to grow the open-source community around Cloud Custodian.Stacklet launches cloud governance platform with $4M seed investment']","Loop, ","['NavigationClose ScreenStacklet', 'Getty ImagesStacklet', 'Foundation Capital', 'Liam Randall', 'Addition and Foundation Capital', 'Travis Stanfield', 'Kapil Thangavelu', 'CTO', 'Microsoft', 'DealerTrack Technologies', 'Amazon’s', 'Thangavelu', 'the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s', 'Capital One', 'Thangavelu', 'Stacklet', 'Stacklet', 'Kapil', 'Foundation Capital’s', 'Sid Trivedi', 'around Cloud Custodian', 'Stacklet', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'FundingStartupsTCcloud', 'Custodiancloud', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/AbfdVP25S1,2021-01-13T01:01:52,"Signal’s Brian Acton talks about exploding growth, monetization and WhatsApp data-sharing outrage","['Brian Acton is crossing paths again with Facebook. Over more than a decade of building and operating WhatsApp, the company’s co-founder first competed against and then sold his instant messaging app to the social juggernaut. Only a few years ago he parted ways with the company that made him a billionaire in a bitter split over messaging and privacy.Now Acton says the ongoing outrage over what Facebook has done to the messaging service he helped build is driving people to his latest project — Signal. Acton, who serves as the executive chairman of the privacy-conscious messaging app’s holding company, told TechCrunch in an interview that the user base of Signal has “exploded” in recent weeks.“The smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes,” said Acton on a video call. “We’re also excited that we are having conversations about online privacy and digital safety and people are turning to Signal as the answer to those questions.”Elon Musk dunks on Facebook and recommends Signal in wake of US Capitol insurrection attempt“It’s a great opportunity for Signal to shine and to give people a choice and alternative. It was a slow burn for three years and then a huge explosion. Now the rocket is going,” he said.The event Acton is referring to is the recent change in data-sharing policy disclosed by WhatsApp, an app that serves more than 2 billion users worldwide.Through an in-app alert, WhatsApp has asked users in recent days to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share their personal data with Facebook. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.Acton said WhatsApp is grappling with incorporating monetization features while still protecting people’s privacy. And its new “complicated policy” has forced WhatsApp and the media to scramble for explanations and “everyone is confused.”Acton did not disclose how many users Signal has amassed in recent weeks, but he said the app currently ranks at the top on App Store in 40 countries and on Google Play Store in 18 countries. (Signal is not the only app that users have explored in recent days as their new home. Telegram said on Tuesday noon that more than 25 million users had joined the platform in the last 72 hours. The app now has over 525 million monthly active users.)WhatsApp hits 2 billion users, up from 1.5 billion 2 years agoAccording to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch, Signal had about 20 million monthly active users globally at the end of December 2020. According to Sensor Tower, the app was downloaded more than 7.5 million times between January 6 and January 10.Since its inception in 2018, Signal has promised that it won’t sell its users’ data and that it won’t show its users ads. In 2018, Acton invested $50 million in Signal Foundation, a check that he said helped get the ball rolling. But how does the messaging app plan to stay afloat in the future?Signal today also relies on donations to bankroll the business — and more users mean more donors, he said. “If Signal gets to a billion users, that’s a billion donors. All we have to do is get you so excited about Signal that you want to give us a dollar or 50 rupees. The idea is that we want to earn that donation. The only way to earn that donation is building an innovative and delightful product. That’s a better relationship in my opinion,” he said.Acton said this model has worked for the business, which keeps a small staff of below 50. Between its frugal spending and the foundation’s largesse, Signal still has some money in the bank.Signal Foundation has also previously said that messenger is its first product, and like Mozilla and Wikimedia Foundation, it intends to expand to more categories. Acton said in the coming years, the team will take a call on whether they want to work on email and storage products, but he said the current focus remains on the messaging app.Even as Acton has publicly urged users to get off Facebook, in our conversation he did not suggest that people should stop using WhatsApp. On the contrary, Acton said he envisions people relying on Signal for conversations with their family and close friends, and using WhatsApp for other chats. “I have no desire to do all the things that WhatsApp does. My desire is to give people a choice,” he said. “Otherwise, you’re locked into something where you have no choice. It’s not strictly a winner take-all scenario.”One of the criticisms that WhatsApp often receives is that it does not do enough to curb the spread of false information on its platform, which has resulted in real-life casualties. I asked Acton what Signal, which also protects its users’ conversations with end-to-end encryption, would do if people started to use his app for a similar purpose. Acton said it’s a difficult challenge and while technology and platform have their own share of responsibilities, they can only do so much especially when you can’t look at the content of the conversation.“You should be teaching your children good digital responsibility. Don’t just immediately take the information that you get. Understand its source. Understand who are trusted sources. As a society, teach every member how it works,” he said, pointing to earlier days of the internet when email scams were rampant and with time and education people learned how to identify them.']",Rho Technologies,"['Brian Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'NavigationClose ScreenSignal’s', 'Brian Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'Phillip Faraone', 'WhatsApp', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Musk', 'Signal', 'attempt“It’s', 'Signal', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Signal', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'App Annie', 'Signal', 'Sensor Tower', 'Signal', 'Signal Foundation', 'Signal', 'Signal', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Signal Foundation', 'Mozilla', 'Wikimedia Foundation', 'Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Acton', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Brian Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'Singh2:01 AM', 'Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

TechCrunch explored the no-code, low-code space in 2020, including asking investors bullish on its market about their views concerning its future.Webflow CEO Vlad Magdalin described the round as “opportunistic” for the company, telling TechCrunch that his company was not low on cash when the deal came together. Indeed, Magdalin said that his company ended 2020 cash-flow positive.Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industriesSo why raise more money, let alone such a huge round? The CEO described the funds as “courage capital,” funds that will allow it to make investments into its business that may not have short-term revenue impacts. Magdalin said that the money may be spent on its enterprise products, support team, platform and recruiting.In an email, Accel investor and Webflow board member Arun Mathew echoed the CEO’s comments, adding that the company doubled its customer base in 2020.That Webflow managed to break into the realm of startup profitability is less surprising when we recall that the no-code software company bootstrapped for more than a half-decade before taking external funds; it has done this before.Raising capital has other impacts on a business than the ability to raise spend. New capital, a higher valuation, and noise about a business can bolster recruiting efforts and assuage customers concerned that the startup in question could either evaporate due to a lack of cash, or wind up bought, and either stripped by a private-equity firm, or subsumed by a tech giant.Big companies don’t want to tie themselves to a product that could disappear. Webflow, now valued at $2.1 billion after its Series B closed, may have allayed those concerns for the time being.Asked how 2020 went for the company, Magdalin said that its business doubled, which he described as an acceleration of its previous results.It’s not clear from our vantage point if the company is in the eight or nine-figure revenue range, so it’s hard to vet how strong a roughly 100% growth rate is for Webflow; that it appears to have bested its 2019 growth rate in 2020 is encouraging for its future IPO prospects.The company could see strong growth in 2021. Webflow’s CEO told TechCrunch that his company’s move up-market is starting to bear fruit. After noting that average contract values, or ACV, for its larger accounts were several orders of magnitude bigger than its sales agreements with SMBs, Magdalin said that its enterprise customers only account for around 5% of its present-day business.However, the CEO said that his firm had only begun to target the enterprise cohort last year, and expects to grow its larger-account business by a factor of 10 this year.And the company has big product plans, including building out its service to support richer and more powerful website creation. In the CEO’s view, websites are merely part of the software world, and he expects no-code tooling to take on more and more complex software tasks over time.That could expand the broader no-code market, in our view, perhaps creating more space for startups to build services that allow for non-developers to depend less on engineering teams over time.Mathew shares Magdalin’s bullish view on the no-code market, saying in an email that “the market is moving very quickly to being bullish on no-code tooling,” adding that we are “still very early in the adoption curve.”Given that take, it’s not hard to see why Accel would want to double-down on Webflow. Accel has a history of making large-dollar bets into companies that bootstrapped to scale, including Webflow and Qualtrics. In the Qualtrics example, Accel led its Series A, B and C rounds (worth a combined total of $400 million).How one VC firm wound up with no-code startups as part of its investing thesisTo see Accel lead another round for Webflow, then, is in keeping with prior investing patterns from the firm.CapitalG’s Sturdy, Webflow’s new board member, told TechCrunch in an email that her firm has been “bullish on the massive potential of no code for years,” leading it to hunt for “the most promising companies utilizing no code to transform sectors and democratize access to key tools.” Let’s see what it can do with another huge check and some time.']",Bryte,"['NavigationClose', 'Wilhelm@alex /', 'Webflow', 'Accel', 'Laela Sturdy', 'Webflow’s', 'Vlad Magdalin', 'Magdalin', 'Magdalin', 'Webflow', 'Arun Mathew', 'Webflow', 'Magdalin', 'Webflow', 'Webflow’s', 'ACV', 'SMBs', 'Magdalin', 'Mathew', 'Magdalin', 'Accel', 'Webflow', 'Qualtrics', 'Qualtrics', 'Accel', 'VC', 'Accel', 'Webflow’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsRecent FundingStartupsTCAccelcapital', 'Wilhelm3:00 PM GMT+1•January 13', 'Webflow', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/GlarozCV9l,2021-01-13T14:08:06,Facebook’s EU-US data transfers face their final countdown,"['Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has agreed to swiftly finalize a long-standing complaint against Facebook’s international data transfers which could force the tech giant to suspend data flows from the European Union to the US within in a matter of months.The complaint, which was filed in 2013 by privacy campaigner Max Schrems, relates to the clash between EU privacy rights and US government intelligent agencies’ access to Facebook users’ data under surveillance programs that were revealed in high resolution detail by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.The DPC has made the commitment to a swift resolution of Schrems’ complaint now in order to settle a judicial review of its processes which noyb, his privacy campaign group, filed last year in response to its decision to pause his complaint and opt to open a new case procedure.Under the terms of the settlement Schrems will also be heard in the DPC’s “own volition” procedure, as well as getting access to all submissions made by Facebook — assuming the Irish courts allow that investigation to go ahead, noyb said today.And while noyb acknowledged there may (yet) be a further pause, as/if the DPC waits on a High Court judgement of Facebook’s own Judicial Review of its processes before revisiting the original complaint, Schrems suggests his 7.5 year old complaint could at long last be headed for a final decision within a matter of months…“The courts in Ireland would be reluctant to give a deadline and the DPC played that card and said they can’t provide a timeline… So we got the maximum that’s possible under Irish law. Which is ‘swift’,” he told TechCrunch, describing this as “frustrating but the maximum possible”.Asked for his estimate of when a final decision will at last close out the complaint, he suggested it could be as soon as this summer — but said that more “realistically” it would be fall.Schrems has been a vocal critic of how the DPC has handled his complaint — and more widely of the slow pace of enforcement of the bloc’s data protection rules vs fast-moving tech giants — with Ireland’s regulator choosing to raise wider concerns about the legality of mechanisms for transferring data from the EU to the US, rather than ordering Facebook to suspend data flows as Schrems had asked in the complaint.The saga has already had major ramifications — leading to a landmark ruling by Europe’s top court last summer when the CJEU struck down a flagship EU-US data transfer arrangement after it found the US does not provide the same high standards of protection for personal data as the EU does.The CJEU also made it clear that EU data protection regulators have a duty to step in and suspend transfers to third countries when data is at risk — putting the ball squarely back in Ireland’s court.Europe puts out advice on fixing international data transfers that’s cold comfort for FacebookReached for comment on the latest development the DPC told us it would have a response later today. So we’ll update this report when we have it.The DPC, which is Facebook’s lead data regulator in the EU under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), sent the tech giant a preliminary order to suspend data transfers back in September — following the landmark ruling by the CJEU.However Facebook immediately filed a legal challenge — couching the DPC’s order as premature, despite the complaint itself being more than seven years old.noyb said today that it’s expecting Facebook to continue to try to use the Irish courts to delay enforcement of EU law. And the tech giant admitted last year that it’s using the courts to ‘send a signal’ to lawmakers to come up with a political resolution for an issue that affects scores of businesses which also transfer data between the EU and the US, as well as to buy time for a new US administration to be in a position to grapple with the issue.But the clock is now ticking on how much longer Zuckerberg can play this game of regulatory whack-a-mole. And a final reckoning for Facebook’s EU data flows could come within half a year.This sets a fairly tight deadline for any negotiations between EU and US lawmakers over a replacement for the defunct EU-US Privacy Shield.European commissioners said last fall that no replacement would be possible without reform of US surveillance law. And whether such radical retooling of US law could come as soon as the summer, or even fall, seems doubtful — unless there’s a major effort among US companies to lobby their own lawmakers to make the necessary changes.In court documents Facebook filed last year, linked to its challenge of the DPC’s preliminary order, the tech giant suggested it might have to close service in Europe if EU law is enforced against its data transfers.However its PR chief, Nick Clegg, swiftly denied Facebook would ever pull service — instead urging EU lawmakers to look favorably on its data-dependent business model by claiming that “personalized advertising” is vital to the EU’s post-COVID-19 economic recovery.The consensus among the bloc’s digital lawmakers, however, is that tech giants need more regulation, not less.Max Schrems on the EU court ruling that could cut Facebook in twoSeparately today, an opinion by an influential advisor to the CJEU could have implications for how swiftly GDPR is enforced in Europe in the future if the court aligns with Advocate General Bobek’s opinion — as he appears to be taking aim at bottlenecks that have formed in key jurisdictions like Ireland as a result of the GDPR’s one-stop-shop mechanism for handling cross-border cases.So while Bobek confirms the general competence of a lead regulator to investigate in cross-border cases, he also writes that “the lead data protection authority cannot be deemed as the sole enforcer of the GDPR in cross-border situations and must, in compliance with the relevant rules and time limits provided for by the GDPR, closely cooperate with the other data protection authorities concerned, the input of which is crucial in this area”.He also sets out specific conditions where national DPAs could bring their own proceedings, in his view, including for the purpose of adopting “urgent measures” or to intervene “following the lead data protection authority having decided not to handle a case”, among other delineated reasons.Responding to the AG’s opinion, the DPC’s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told us: “We, along with our colleague EU DPAs, note the opinion of the Advocate General and await the final judgment of the Court in terms of its interpretation of any relevant One Stop Shop rules.”Asked for a view on the AG’s remarks, Jef Ausloos, a postdoc researcher in data privacy at the University of Amsterdam, said the opinion conveys “a clear recognition that ACTUAL protection and enforcement might be crippled by the [one-stop-shop] mechanism”.However he suggested any new openings for DPAs to bypass a lead regulator that could flow from the opinion aren’t likely to shake things up in the short term. “I think the door is open for some changes/bypassing DPC. BUT, only in the long run,” he said.\xa0GDPR’s two-year review flags lack of ‘vigorous’ enforcement']",committed $100 million,"['Facebook’s', 'NavigationClose ScreenFacebook’s', 'Lomas@riptari', 'Data Protection Commission', 'the European Union', 'Max Schrems', 'EU', 'NSA', 'Edward Snowden', 'DPC', 'High Court', 'Facebook’s', 'Judicial Review', 'EU', 'CJEU', 'EU', 'EU', 'CJEU', 'EU', 'FacebookReached', 'DPC', 'EU', 'General Data Protection Regulation', 'EU', 'EU', 'Zuckerberg', 'Facebook’s EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'EU', 'Nick Clegg', 'EU', 'Max Schrems', 'EU', 'CJEU', 'Advocate General Bobek’s', 'Bobek', 'AG', 'Graham Doyle', 'EU', 'the Advocate General', 'Court', 'AG', 'Jef Ausloos', 'the University of Amsterdam', 'ACTUAL', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'lawFacebookirelandmass', 'SchremsPrivacy ShieldFacebook’s', '2021Ireland’s Data Protection Commission', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/I16umkyML0,2021-01-13T14:00:05,Loop launches out of stealth to make auto insurance more equitable,"['Car auto-insurance from legacy providers has structural bias built into it. It uses metrics such as credit score, income, marital status and education to figure out insurance rates, which eventually disproportionately hurts low-income individuals through high rates and low protection.Loop, co-founded by John Henry and Carey Anne Nadeau, hopes to launch an alternative model that is equitable for all communities.“Structural bias is baked into financial services and institutions that perpetuate and reinforce [it],” said Nadeau, who has worked at Brookings Institute and studied at MIT around topics of mobility. “We can’t just focus on banking, [and] insurance is sort of the overlooked ugly stepchild in the world view of financial services.”How to rewrite the rulesLoop is a managing general agent (MGA) business so it can act as a broker and a vendor in the insurance space. It markets, acquires and services customers, instead of serving simply as a vendor built atop an existing insurance provider. The startup, also a B corp, is prioritizing profit alongside the environment and social dynamics.The startup is trying to rewrite the rules of auto insurance by using two key metrics to track, create and charge insurance rates: state of roads and driver behavior. Loop bases rates off of usage, while a legacy provider might base rates off of demographics.Loop is a mobile-only product that vertically integrates with insurance carriers.Once a user downloads an app, Loop will find a quote for the user based on their location. The secret sauce is Loop’s tech: Using a database of over 100 million car crashes in 27 states, Loop creates a quote for a user based on their location. Henry, who co-founded Harlem Capital, describes Loop’s data is “almost a God-level understanding of crashes that have occurred on each, individual road.”The startup also uses data around traffic volume, roadway infrastructure and weather data to set rates. The artificial intelligence capabilities could allow Loop to, say, steer a driver off of a road that has high-risk for crashes. Or it could simply reward them for clearing the road without a bumper scratch.Image Credits: LoopThe other part of its business is based on telematics technology, which allows Loop to understand how and where a driver is going at all times. While legacy carriers might use lack of accidents to incentivize lower rates, Loop is using data to both set the rate and lower it.Exchanging data for more flexibility could raise some eyebrows, but the co-founders think their customer-base, largely millennials and Gen Z, are comfortable with the model as it promises fairer prices. Loop makes a gross commission on every policy it sells.Loop also pointed to Ohio-based Root Insurance as an example of how consumers are growing more comfortable with sharing location data. The car insurance startup went public in what many saw as a successful IPO for a midwestern high-growth tech company. Root similarly uses metrics like driver performance and history with telematics technology.3 lessons from Root’s IPO pricing“They use telematics but they still are largely using legacy insurance models,” says Henry. “We’re kind of replacing that with our own AI based approach.”Root might be the most obvious competitor, but usage-based pricing has been a rising dynamic in insurance for over a decade through various forms. Flexible insurtech has been on a tear recently, with MetroMile’s SPAC, Lemonade’s IPO and, on the early-stage front, Marshmallow, a U.K. based auto insurance startup last valued at $130 million.The co-founders are confident that their technology is differentiated enough to survive the hot competition.A racial reckoning and a tweetThe idea for the startup began in July 2020, when George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by police. Protests erupted across the world, rallying for change and solutions to address systemic racism. VC firms rushed to support Black founders, and Henry saw a gap in solutions committed to change.Henry tweeted in reaction:“It occurred to me that the change that we’re looking for was not gonna just bring itself about,” Henry said. “It takes intentional tackling of systemic issues.” He knew Nadeau had focused on transportation and mobility, and the duo eventually decided that they would “swing big.”Carey Anne Nadeau and John Henry, the co-founders of Loop. Image Credits: LoopWhile the co-founders admit the goal is ambitious, they have secured investors that think Loop could be a big business one day. The startup tells TechCrunch that it has raised a $3.25 million seed round led by Freestyle VC, with participation from Blue Fog Capital, Fontinalis Capital Partners, Concrete Rose, Uprising Ventures and Backstage Capital. Participating angel investors include Kristen Dickey, Steve Schlafman, Songe LaRon, Craig J. Lewis, Gerard Adams and Joshua Dorkin.The money will be used for hiring and developing its data science infrastructure. It’s not live in the market yet, but is launching in Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and New York (pending regulatory approval, of course).The team met up with 77 investors, 25% of which were female investors, to get the funding needed to start Loop.“It was more difficult than we thought,” said Henry. “We knew from the jump that we wanted to raise a larger seed round to signal to the market that we were looking to grow big.”Loop eventually closed the goal round and valuation. As for the tipping point that got investors to back a company disrupting a $256 million industry with around $3 million in seed financing?Mission, Henry says.“I literally have goosebumps right now because the mission will open doors that profit cannot,” he said.']",world’s most valuable edtech startup,"['Loop', 'NavigationClose', 'Petovarga / Getty ImagesCar', 'Loop', 'John Henry', 'Carey Anne Nadeau', 'Nadeau', 'Brookings Institute', 'MIT', 'Loop', 'Loop', 'Loop’s', 'Loop', 'Henry', 'Harlem Capital', 'Loop’s', 'LoopThe', 'Loop', 'Loop', 'Gen Z', 'Loop', 'Loop', 'Root Insurance', 'Root’s', 'Henry', 'AI', 'MetroMile’s SPAC', 'Marshmallow', 'George Floyd', 'Black', 'Black', 'Henry', 'Henry', 'Henry', 'Nadeau', 'Anne Nadeau', 'John Henry', 'Loop', 'Freestyle VC', 'Blue Fog Capital', 'Fontinalis Capital Partners', 'Concrete Rose, Uprising Ventures and', 'Backstage Capital', 'Kristen Dickey', 'Steve Schlafman', 'Craig J.

The company will use the proceeds to further expand their commercial banking platform aimed at high-growth businesses, starting with today’s launch of Rho AP. The platform is oriented toward companies that need more autonomy in business banking and will map quite well to the current distributed nature of work, post-pandemic.After raising capital and launching in December 2020, the platform now claims to be handling more than $2 billion per year in annualized transaction volume for its clients. Rho AP expands on the core banking platform by enabling companies to run full accounts payable lifecycles right within Rho, meaning invoices are uploaded, approved, coded and paid — all within Rho. Companies no longer need another payables solution in addition to their bank account.Rho’s platform approach consists of a single solution that encompasses both collaborative finance software and commercial-grade banking. It was founded by former Point72 and Deutsche Bank alum Everett Cook (CEO) and British-Canadian serial entrepreneur Alex Wheldon. Banking services are provided by Evolve Bank and Trust, member FDIC.In a statement, Cook said: “At Rho, we are dedicated to empowering the teams that run today’s growing companies. We’ve developed the modern commercial banking platform built around the way companies operate today: distributed, team-oriented, transparent and built for scale. Rho AP is the next step on our mission to help teams work better together with money.”Latif Peracha, general partner at M13 and board member at Rho said: “We knew Rho had product-market fit when we discovered that several of our portfolio companies which span different sectors and sizes chose Rho for their banking needs. We believe there is an opportunity to build a powerful brand in business banking that treats the enterprise – and specifically, the CFO – as a consumer, and Rho has done that with a fully integrated product that makes managing a business much easier.”Wheldon said: “Having built and scaled multiple businesses, I’d always found that commercial banking was a major point of friction. Rho is empowering the whole organization to work better together by removing the silos and bottlenecks associated with finance.”']",Rapyd,"['M13 Ventures', 'NavigationClose', 'M13 VenturesMike Butcher@mikebutcher', 'Rho TechnologiesRho Technologies', 'NYC', 'Rho Business Banking', 'M13 Ventures', 'Torch Capital and Inspired Capital', 'Rho AP', 'Rho AP', 'Rho', 'Rho', 'Rho’s', 'Point72', 'Deutsche Bank', 'Everett Cook', 'Alex Wheldon', 'Evolve Bank and Trust', 'Cook', 'Rho AP', 'Rho', 'Rho', 'CFO', 'Rho', 'Rho', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'VenturesRho', 'Technologies', 'NYC', 'Rho Business Banking', 'M13 Ventures', 'Torch Capital and Inspired Capital', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

This comes as the company moves away from selling its $8,000 mattress direct to consumers and instead is working with partners who will utilize Bryte’s technology in their mattresses.Bryte says several deals are in the works.According to the company, this pivot has always been part of the plan. They feel that through licensing, they can better accomplish the company’s goal of improving people’s sleep experience. Bryte doesn’t want to become another direct to consumer brand, but rather the underlying technology in some of the best mattresses.The company’s original product is still available to consumers. Called the Restorative Bed, the mattress has built-in sensors and 100 computer-controlled pneumatic coils that work with the platform as it learns owners’ sleeping patterns and adjusts to best suit them — for both sleepers. Bryte says its technology enables better sleep patterns by adjusting the mattress through monitoring temperature, pressure points and room environment.The user selects several starting points for the mattress system. The system uses micro-adjustments to fine-tune the system to the sleeper. Each night’s sleep provides the mattress with more data points, which it uses to continually adjust the settings. The company says the greatest gains happen within two-four weeks and tend to reach an optimal level within 90 days.With this funding round, the company is adding serious cash to its mission.ARCHina Capital lead the $24 million Series A funding round, with ARCHina’s co-founder Amy Huang joining Bryte’s board.

Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, is leading the initiative. Today, Apple is sharing some of its work as part of the initiative.“We’re launching REJI’s latest initiatives with partners across a broad range of industries and backgrounds — from students to teachers, developers to entrepreneurs, and community organizers to justice advocates — working together to empower communities that have borne the brunt of racism and discrimination for far too long. We are honored to help bring this vision to bear, and to match our words and actions to the values of equity and inclusion we have always prized at Apple,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement.The company will contribute $25 million to the Propel Center, an innovation and learning hub for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. It is going to be both a virtual platform and a physical campus in the Atlanta University Center. Apple is sharing some early renderings of the new building (see above and below).Students will be able to follow different educational tracks focused on artificial intelligence, agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment, app development, augmented reality, design and creative arts and entrepreneurship. This isn’t just a monetary investment for Apple, as employees will help develop curricula and provide mentorship as well. There will be internship opportunities for students.In downtown Detroit, the company will also open an Apple Developer Academy focused on young Black entrepreneurs. This is a collaborative effort with Michigan State University. It’ll be open to all learners across Detroit and teach valuable skills for entrepreneurs, creators and coders.There will be two programs. A 30-day introductory program will help you learn more about app economy careers. And if you’re willing to dive deeper, there’s an intensive 10 to 12-month program. Apple is trying to reach 1,000 students per year with these two programs.The third effort is focused on investment opportunities for Black and brown entrepreneurs. Apple will invest $10 million with Harlem Capital, a VC firm based in New York. There will be more collaboration between Harlem Capital and Apple down the road.Apple is also investing $25 million in Siebert Williams Shank’s Clear Vision Impact Fund. Finally, Apple is making a contribution to The King Center.As you can see, Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative is an ongoing effort that requires evaluating new opportunities constantly.

The startup, which turned profitable in late 2019, served over 70 million students as of late last year.In an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last year, Byju’s co-founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran said the startup, which acquired a coding platform aimed at young students called WhiteHat Jr for $300 million last year, was open to more merger and acquisition opportunities.India’s Byju’s acquires WhiteHat Jr. for $300 millionThe startup is backed by several high-profile investors, including Bond, which was co-founded by Mary Meeker. Bond expects Byju’s to be worth over $30 billion within three years, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch earlier.Updated at 5.48PM IST, Wednesday: An Aakash spokesperson issued the following statement. “Aakash Educational Services Limited (AESL) is in talks with Byju’s for building a strong partnership. The Chaudhry family and Founders, Mr JC Chaudhry & Mr Aakash Chaudhry remain committed and will continue to run Aakash Educational Services along with its management team with the same passion and commitment. Putting these speculations to rest, we would like to state that AESL is on a mission to build India’s largest digitally-enabled, omni-channel education company. We will accelerate our digital transformation and deliver phenomenal value to our students. We will rapidly expand our omni channel & digital offerings, as we embark on the next trajectory of quality education & growth. We remain true to our Founder’s motto of ‘Student First,’ enabling us to deliver long-term value to our students, employees, investors and other stakeholders.”']",unveiled a similar plan in India,"['Byju’s', 'NavigationClose ScreenByju’s', 'Singh@refsrc /', 'Raj K Raj / Hindustan Times / Getty ImagesWe', 'Byju’s', 'Bloomberg', 'Aakash Educational Services', 'Byju’s', 'Aakash Educational Services', 'Blackstone', 'Byju’s', 'Byju’s', 'Byju’s', 'Byju’s', 'Byju Raveendran', 'WhiteHat Jr', 'Byju’s', 'WhiteHat Jr.', 'Bond', 'Mary Meeker', 'Bond', 'Byju’s', 'Aakash Educational Services Limited', 'Byju’s', 'Chaudhry', 'Aakash Educational Services', 'AESL', 'Founder’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', ""Educational Servicesbyju'sindiaUnacademyByju’s"", 'Singh5:05', 'Byju’s', 'Bloomberg', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/MP0W5NqKIG,2021-01-13T12:05:28,Rapyd raises $300M on a $2.5B valuation to boost its fintech-as-a-service API,"['A wave of organizations — propelled by global COVID-19 pandemic circumstances — are moving their commercial and financial interactions online, and today one of the big players helping to enable that shift is announcing a significant round of growth funding to expand the tools and services that it provides to them.Rapyd, which provides an API-based “fintech-as-a-service” platform covering payments, banking services, fraud protection and more, has raised $300 million, funding that CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman said in an interview will be used to expand its team, build out more technology (next up: expanded fraud ID services and a wider marketplace) and make selected acquisitions.Rapyd’s customer base now numbers about 5,000 businesses, which includes marketplaces (labor marketplaces and marketplaces for goods), e-commerce businesses, other kinds of lenders and any business that might want to incorporate transactions or new financial services into their wider offerings. Shtilman said that at the moment, Rapyd is seeing its strongest growth yet, onboarding about 500 new customers each week.The funding is coming at a $2.5 billion post-money valuation, Shtilman confirmed. (For some context on that, Rapyd was last valued at $1.2 billion in December 2019.)The round is a Series D and is being led by prolific growth-round VC Coatue, with Spark Capital, Avid Ventures, FJ Labs and Latitude (all new backers), as well as General Catalyst, Oak HC/FT, Tiger Global, Target Global, Durable Capital, Tal Capital and Entrée Capital (all previous backers) also participating. Other past investors, notably, include another major player in the world of API-based financial services, Stripe.As with other companies in categories that have seen a huge surge of demand in the last year, financial services — and in particular those providing services to be able to carry out transactions online via the internet or phone — have proven to be some of the most mandatory and most used. (And no wonder, since bills still need paying, food and other items still need to be purchased, loans very much still need to be made and so on.)This was what many would call an “opportunistic” raise, made not to keep the lights on or to extend runway, but because the money was being offered to Rapyd at good terms, and there were smart places where it could be put to use to grow the business.“We didn’t plan to raise money when we raised this round, but when the pandemic came in our business started to boom,” Shtilman said. “We were approached by existing investors to scale beyond our original business plans after we completed our 2021 growth plans in three months in 2020. So we thought the timing was probably right for world domination.”Shtilman was partly (only partly) joking — he has a sort of deadpan delivery that I can’t quite capture here — but it’s a far cry from the startup’s early days, when “no one wanted to invest because everyone thought it would be too hard to execute. Even our early investors advised us to focus on a smaller concept. But we thought building globally doesn’t work. To start small is against the idea. Over the last several years, the need to explain what we do [has] almost vanished.”The challenge (and opportunity) that Rapyd identified back in 2017 when it first opened for business (having been hatched in Israel originally) is that the global commerce and financial markets are very highly fragmented. Consumers and businesses in individual markets have their own preferred payment methods and demands, regulations differ and the key companies involved vary from country to country.Meanwhile, APIs have long been a great instrument for integration and connection: Using a few lines of code — and presuming your own services are built on code too — you can knit together services, and bring in commoditized functionality that would take ages to build from the ground up, cutting down the effort and work needed, to focus on making your core business more unique.Mambu raises $135M at a $2B+ valuation for a SaaS platform that powers banking servicesWhile companies like Stripe, Twilio and many others had identified the opportunity of leveraging APIs to scale out a world of functionality to a wider set of would-be customers, what Rapyd really identified and built out was the idea of loading not just one, two or three services, but hundreds (even thousands) of features into that proposition. In fintech, where those services are complex, there is a big array of them from which to choose what to build, and also a big pool of would-be customers to use them, if you are aiming wide.The idea is smart and, as Shtilman noted, very much in keeping with the economies of scale that exist in e-commerce and fintech: Individual transactions are at the end of the day very incremental, so services that bring many together can finally start to conceive of interesting returns.That, of course, is not just something Rapyd has identified and run with. That is to say, the company has a number of competitors now in the market.Just last week, Germany-based Mambu, which also provides an API-based suite of services (7,000 at last count) under the idea of “banking as a service,” raised $135 million at a valuation of over $2 billion. Stripe, a backer of Rapyd, also has continued to expand and add a number of services well beyond payments. Thought Machine also raised a big round last year; Temenos\xa0and Italy’s\xa0Edera are also strong players here.And the field has so much opportunity that it’s even attracting a lot of newer entrants: witness Unit, another interesting player that came out of stealth in the U.S. in December with an interesting list of backers of its own.Unit raises $18.6M to offer banking features as a service“To build financial infrastructure, it doesn’t matter whether you are a small mom and pop or something bigger, you need many things, and if you want to sell in more than one jurisdiction you need a lot of those services,” Shtilman noted about the need for scale and breadth in a fintech platform proposition.\xa0He’s also very sanguine about competition.“They have emerged like mushrooms after the rain,” he said. “But if you don’t have competition it means you don’t have a business, so this is good. It means there is a lot of demand. But for now we are the market leader. We think we will become the AWS of this space.”That’s where investors like Coatue are also landing for now.“The payment landscape varies dramatically across countries. A company doing business globally might need to accept hundreds of local payment methods. Rapyd’s API, which abstracts away this complexity, is currently powering what we think are many of the world’s most exciting companies,” said Kris Fredrickson, managing partner at Coatue, in a statement. “We are honored to partner with Arik and team for the next phase of the Rapyd journey.”']",NexTravel,"['NavigationClose ScreenRapyd', 'APIIngrid', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Arik Shtilman', 'Shtilman', 'Rapyd', 'Shtilman', 'Rapyd', 'VC Coatue', 'Spark Capital', 'Avid Ventures', 'FJ Labs', 'General Catalyst', 'Tiger Global', 'Durable Capital', 'Tal Capital', 'Entrée Capital', 'Shtilman', 'Shtilman', 'Mambu', 'Machine', 'Temenos', 'Shtilman', 'Coatue', 'Rapyd’s API', 'Kris Fredrickson', 'Coatue', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/xvGUoNghy1,2021-01-13T10:52:35,YouTube puts a temporary freeze on uploads to Trump’s channel,"['YouTube has been the slowest of the big social media platforms to react to the threat of letting president Trump continue to use its platform as a megaphone to whip up insurrection in the wake of the attack on the US capital last week. But it’s now applied a temporary upload ban.In a short Twitter thread today, the Google-owned service said it had removed new content uploaded to Trump’s YouTube channel “in light of concerns about the ongoing potential violence”.It also said it’s applied a first strike — triggering a temporary upload ban for at least seven days.At the time of writing the verified Donald J Trump YouTube channel has some 2.78M subscribers.“Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump’s channel, as we’ve done to other channels where there are safety concerns found in the comments section,” YouTube adds.2/ Given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump’s channel, as we’ve done to other channels where there are safety concerns found in the comments section. https://t.co/1aBENHGU5z— YouTubeInsider (@YouTubeInsider) January 13, 2021We reached out to YouTube with questions about the content that was removed and how it will determine whether to extend the ban on Trump’s ability to post to its platform beyond seven days.A spokeswoman confirmed content that was uploaded to the channel on January 12 had been taken down for violating its policies on inciting violence, with the platform saying it perceiving an increased risk of violence in light of recent events and due to earlier remarks by Trump.She did not confirm the specific content of the video that triggered the takedown and strike.According to YouTube, platform is applying its standard ‘three strikes’ policy — whereby, within a 90 day period, if a channel receives three strikes it gets permanently suspended. Under this policy a first strike earns around a week’s suspension, a second strike earns around two weeks and a third strike triggers a termination of the channel.At the time of writing, Trump’s official YouTube channel has a series of recent uploads — including five clips from a speech he gave at the Mexican border wall, where he lauded “successful” completion of the pledge during the 2016 election campaign to ‘build the wall’.In one of these videos, entitled “President Trump addresses the events of last week”, Trump characterizes supporters who attacked the US capital as a “mob” — and claims his administration “believes in the rule of law, not in violence or rioting” — before segueing into a series of rambling comments about the pandemic and vaccine development.The clip ends with an entreaty by Trump for “our nation to heal”, for “peace and for calm”, and for respect for law enforcement — with the president claiming people who work in law enforcement form the backbone of the “MAGA agenda”.An earlier clip of Trump speaking to reporters before he left for the tour of the border wall is also still viewable on the channel.In it the president attacks the process to impeach him a second time as “a continuation of the greatest witch-hunt in the history of politics”. Here Trump name-checks Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer — in what sounds like a veiled but targeted threat.“[For them] to continue on this path, I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country and it’s causing tremendous anger,” he says, before tossing a final caveat at reporters that “I want no violence”. (But, well, if you have to add such a disclaimer what does that say about the sentiments you know you’re whipping up?)The deplatforming of President TrumpWhile YouTube has opted for a temporary freeze on Trump’s megaphone, Twitter banned the president for good last week after one too many violations of its civic integrity policy.Facebook has also imposed what it describes as an “indefinite” suspension — leaving open the possibility that it could in future restore Trump’s ability to use its tools to raise hell.Up to now, YouTube has managed to avoid being the primary target of ire for those criticizing social media platforms for providing Trump with a carve out from their rules of conduct and a mainstream platform to abuse, bully, lie and (most recently) whip up insurrection.However the temporary freeze on his account comes after civil rights groups had threatened to organize an advertiser boycott of its platform.Per Reuters, the Stop Hate for Profit (SHP) campaign — which previously led a major advertisers boycott of Facebook last summer\xa0— had demanded that YouTube take down Trump’s verified channel.“If YouTube does not agree with us and join the other platforms in banning Trump, we’re going to go to the advertisers,” one of SHP’s organizers, Jim Steyer, told the news agency.In its official comments about the enforcement action against president Trump, YouTube makes no mention of any concern about ramifications from its own advertisers. Though, in recent years, it has faced some earlier boycotts from advertisers over hateful and offensive content.In background remarks to reporters, YouTube also claims it consistently enforces its policies, regardless of who owns the channel — and says it makes no exceptions for public figures. However the platform has been known to reverse a three strike termination — recently reinstating the channel of UK broadcaster TalkRadio, for example, after it received a third strike related to coronavirus misinformation. In that case the channel’s reinstatement was reported to have followed an intervention by TalkRadio’s owner News Corp’s chairman, Rupert Murdoch. UK ministers had also defended the channel’s right to debate the merits of government policy.In Trump’s case there are a dwindling number of (GOP) politicians willing to ride to his defense in light of the shocking events in Washington last week and continued violent threats being made online by his supporters.However concern about the massive market power of tech platforms — meaning they are in a position to be able to take unilateral action and shut down the US president’s ability to broadcast to millions of people — is far more widespread.Earlier this week Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, called Twitter’s ban on Trump “problematic”, while lawmakers elsewhere in Europe have said it must lead to regulatory consequences for big tech.So whatever his wider legacy, Trump certainly looks set to have a lasting policy impact on the tech giants he is now busy railing at for putting him on mute.Europe seizes on social media’s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulation']",online interactive experience,"['Trump’s', 'NavigationClose', 'Trump’s', 'Lomas@riptari /', 'Trump', 'Google', 'Trump’s', 'YouTube', 'Donald J Trump YouTube', 'Trump’s', 'Trump’s', 'YouTube', 'Trump’s', 'Trump', 'YouTube', 'Trump’s', 'YouTube', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Nancy Pelosi', 'Chuck Schumer', 'TrumpWhile YouTube', 'Trump’s', 'Twitter', 'Trump’s', 'YouTube', 'Trump', 'Reuters', 'the Stop Hate for Profit', 'YouTube', 'Trump’s', 'YouTube', 'Trump', 'SHP', 'Jim Steyer', 'Trump', 'YouTube', 'YouTube', 'TalkRadio', 'TalkRadio’s', 'News Corp’s', 'Rupert Murdoch', 'Trump’s', 'GOP', 'Angela Merkel', 'Twitter’s', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Trump’s', 'Trump', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/u6pfVjIdI2,2021-01-13T10:00:12,TikTok update will change privacy settings and defaults for users under 18,"['TikTok announced today it’s making changes to its app to make the experience safer for younger users. The company will now set the accounts for users ages 13 to 15 to private by default, as well as tighten other controls for all users under 18, in terms of how they can interact with other users and TikTok content itself. TikTok is also announcing a partnership with Common Sense Networks, a media company focused on creating and curating age-appropriate and engaging media experiences for kids and families.The partnership will see Common Sense Networks working with TikTok to provide additional guidance on the appropriateness of its content for users under 13.The social video app in 2019 had been fined $5.7 million by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for violating U.S. children’s privacy laws. The FTC had begun looking into the app back when it was known as Musical.ly. The earlier version, prior to its acquisition by ByteDance, had collected personal information for children under 13 without parents’ consent.As a result of that ruling, TikTok created a new, legally compliant experience for younger users in the U.S. with age-appropriate content and no ability to publish videos.Now, TikTok will restrict the experience for other minors using the app who are over 13, too.For children ages 13 to 15, accounts will be set to private by default and TikTok will turn off the setting “Suggest your account to others.” This will allow users’ videos to only be seen by those they approve as a follower and limits their account from being recommended to others elsewhere in the app.Commenting controls are also being locked down for these users.They’ll now be able to choose between “Friends” or “No One” in terms of who can comment on their videos, and the “Everyone” option will be removed. The Dueting and Stitching features will also be removed, which limits how these younger users can engage with other TikTok users and their content. They won’t be able to make their videos downloadable either.For those ages 16 to 17, the default setting for Duet and Stitch will be set to “Friends,” and they’ll only be able to download videos created by users 16 and over as a result of the lockdowns for younger users. Downloads for their own videos will also be set to Off by default, but they can enable this, if they choose.TikTok had already restricted younger users’ accounts before today in various ways, including not only through the under-13 age-gated experience, but also by restricting direct messaging and hosting livestreams to accounts 16 and over, and restricting virtual gifts to users over 18. Parents additionally have had the option to control their child’s experience through the Family Pairing feature, which offers parental controls and screen time limits, among other things.Of course, any of these restrictions can be worked around for those who lie about their age upon sign-up. But it’s still fairly unusual for a large social network to do more than look the other way when it knows that minors are on its app.In TikTok’s case, however, it has a large underage user base — some estimates have said that 41% of TikTok is between ages 16 and 24. But in the U.S., TikTok has attracted a particularly large teenage userbase. The company said in 2020 that 60% of its 26.5 million monthly active users in the U.S. were between 16 and 24. Even some of TikTok’s biggest stars, like Charli D’Amelio, are still just teenagers.The attention to minor safety and parental controls gathered TikTok praise from notable youth safety experts, which the company also shared.Today, TikTok is touting praise it’s received from the National PTA, ConnectSafely, NCMEC, Family Online Safety Institute and WeProtect Global Alliance. The groups believe the changes will help teens be able to use the app more safely, responsibility and without the further risk of exploitation.“We couldn’t be more pleased about partnering with TikTok to develop better content experiences for users under the age of 13,” added Eric Berger, CEO of Common Sense Networks, in reference to his organization’s partnership with the social video platform. “At Common Sense Networks, we see this engagement as an opportunity to double down on our commitment to elevate the quality of children’s digital media so that age-appropriate content is the rule in our industry and not the exception,” he said.The changes will roll out starting today.Correction: Common Sense Networks is a for-profit affiliate of a nonprofit (Common Sense Media.)

https://t.co/9F4mpeqlvq,2021-01-13T08:44:55,Amazon launches $1.2 mobile Prime Video plan in India,"['Amazon is doubling down on one of the biggest strengths of its Prime Video streaming service: aggressive pricing.The e-commerce giant on Wednesday launched Prime Video Mobile Edition, an even more affordable tier of the on-demand video streaming service — now also bundling some mobile data.Prime Video Mobile Edition, for which Amazon has partnered with Indian telecom network Airtel, will feature 28-day mobile-only, single-user, standard definition (SD) access to customers in India for Rs 89 ($1.22). This tier will include 6GB of mobile data that customers can consume during the subscription period. There’s also a slightly expensive plan for Prime Video Mobile Edition that will charge customers Rs 299 but will offer 1.5GB mobile data for each day of the subscription. To anyone who subscribes to Prime Video Mobile Edition, Amazon says it will pick the tab for the first month.Amazon Prime subscription costs $1.7 a month in India and includes access to Prime Video and Prime Music.The new Prime Video plan is currently only available in India. Its launch comes two years after Netflix unveiled a similar plan in India.Affordable pricing is key for on-demand steaming services that are looking to make inroads in India, the world’s second-largest internet market. Even as more than 600 million users are online in the country today, only a fraction of them currently pay to access digital subscriptions. In a recent report to clients, analysts at Goldman Sachs estimated that gaming and video streaming market in India could clock as much as $5 billion in gross value transactions by March 2025.Netflix launches Rs 199 ($2.8) mobile-only monthly plan in India“India is one of our fastest growing territories in the world with very high engagement rates. Buoyed by this response, we want to double-down by offering our much-loved entertainment content to an even larger base of Indian customers. Given high mobile broadband penetration in the country, the mobile phone has become one of the most widely used streaming devices,” said Jay Marine, vice president, Amazon Prime Video Worldwide, in a statement.Airtel, the second-largest telecom operator in India, is the first roll-out partner for Prime Video Mobile Edition, said Sameer Batra, director, Mobile Business Development at Amazon, suggesting that the company may ink similar deals with other telecom operators in the country as it looks to expand the “reach of our service to the entire pre-paid customer base in India.”Nearly every on-demand video streaming service in India, including Netflix and Disney+ Hotstar, maintain various partnerships with local telecom operators and satellite TV providers to reach more users in the country.

https://t.co/8TtGbuGqPi,2021-01-13T08:01:17,Business trip platform TravelPerk buys YC-backed rival NexTravel,"['Barcelona-based TravelPerk has scooped up US-based rival NexTravel as the pandemic drives consolidation in one of the sector’s hardest hit by COVID-19.It’s not disclosing how much it’s shelling out for NexTravel, which has some 700 customers globally and has processed around 300,000 trips since being founded back in 2013, but says the deal is its largest acquisition to date — with the aim of beefing up its business in the US. (Also today it’s announcing a partnership with Southwest Airlines that plugs a key gap in its US offering.)The US has always been a top five market for TravelPerk, per CEO and co-founder, Avi Meir, but after the NexTravel acquisition it becomes its largest market.“US customers, US know-how, [US-based] team,” he said, listing the drivers for the acquisition. “They’ve built an amazing product. It’s a Y Combinator company who started 2-3 years before us and they focused only or mostly on the US market so they have an expertise that is very complementary to what we’re doing.”Meir confirmed NexTravel’s founders and team are joining TravelPerk as part of the deal. Existing customers include the likes of Yelp, Stripe and Harry’s.“They’re a great company. I really think we have great execution and we got into the crisis with a much better cash position and COVID-19 is creating opportunities that didn’t exist before,” he added. “We had friendly competition and just the context of the situation was we were in a better position to acquire them vs them acquiring us.”The plan is to migrate users of the US product onto TravelPerk’s platform over time but Meir said the NexTravel team will continue to support the product for the foreseeable future while it works on understanding and plugging any functionality gaps with the aim of ensuring a smooth, eventual transition for NexTravel customers in the future.The acquisition is only TravelPerk’s second after it picked up risk management startup Albatross last summer — underlining how the coronavirus crisis is retooling priorities for businesses in the travel sector.Or at least those that have enough funding to see them through the revenue crunch. And Meir confirmed TravelPerk has its eye on more acquisition targets.“We are in the process of talking with a few more [potential acquisitions],” he said, adding: “In a moment of crisis consolidation typically happens so I think it’s fair to expect more of this.”Three travel startups tell us how they’re responding to the coronavirus crisisWhile a couple of years ahead of TravelPerk in starting up a business travel booking business, NexTravel has raised considerably less over its run — pulling in circa $4.5M in funding, according to Crunchbase.The younger Spain-based startup, meanwhile, grew faster and has raised orders of magnitude more (~$134M to date) — including a $60M top-up to its Series C in 2019 when it was reporting 2,000 customers globally.“We just happen to be in Europe,” Meir told TechCrunch, discussing how his European startup is in a position to buy a US rival (when the reverse is all too often the case in tech) — and pointing to knowledge of how to localize as a key advantage. “We were never targeting the Spanish market exclusively or not even the European market.“To win in business travel, one of the paradoxes is you have to build a very localized product… So we never saw ourselves as a European business we just recognize that we have to really localize deeply in order to be successful anywhere. But we have to do it across the world. So this acquisition is just another step in localizing for the US.”“[The acquisition] will obviously drive a lot of product development, of commercial investments, of partnerships,” he added. “In a way we’re doing it knowing that it will force us to do more of the US — so it’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophesy — but it’s a $300BN business travel market so we should better make some moves around it.”With the pandemic continuing to ravage much of the globe — including both the US and Europe — there’s likely to be considerably fewer billions of dollars on business travel value up for grabbed for a sizeable chunk of 2021. And Meir confirmed that TravelPerk isn’t expecting to see a revival in the market before the second half of this year.Nonetheless, he remains bullish that once vaccinations are rolled out to the most vulnerable groups in society business travellers will be on the move once again — predicting that Zoom fatigue and the boom in remote working will rekindle demand for face-to-face human contact.“My best guess right now is everything converges to around the second half of this year — around May-June maybe — where seasonality should hopefully hit. Meaning we’ll see the same decline in hospitalizations and deaths as we saw last year. That’s my hope,” he predicted.\xa0“On top of that we have the vaccines… Within the next 4-5 months there is reason to expect that we’ll see [vaccine rollouts] accelerating and then everything converges. We just need the at risk population to be safe for the world to be open again.”“It doesn’t mean we’ll be completely done with corona but it won’t be as deadly as it is now so we’ll be able to open up more and remove restrictions and see travel coming back again,” he added.Zoom earnings, remote work and a terrible but possibly bright moment for startupsPressed on whether businesses might not have adjusted to a new, ‘more digital’ normal after 1.5 years of living with COVID-19 — having come to rely on a suite of videoconferencing and virtual meeting tools — Meir quashes the idea of a smaller business travel market replacing the pre-pandemic industry, predicting a “roaring ’20s” revival for business travel instead, fuelled by “Zoom fatigue” and networking FOMO once social distancing restrictions can be lifted.“If you still own any Zoom shares you should sell them!” he quipped, speaking via Zoom call (obviously). “This is going down from now. Everybody is tired of this. The Zoom fatigue is real. It creates a lot of mental health concerns, social isolation… Maslow’s Pyramid of Needs is still here, and it’s even stronger than ever, I think, because we realize how bad it is when we don’t meet people in real life. When everything has to be through this weird, proxy to human connection. The virus doesn’t change human nature. We still need to meet each other face to face.”“The first sales person who’s going to lose a sale because the competition went and took the customer to dinner and they wanted to do it via Zoom, they’re on a plane the next day. So competition will solve it — even if we put aside human nature,” he added. “I think we all recognize even more how much we need human connection.”So even if some some “transactional meetings” do move permanently to Zoom, as Meir conceded “maybe” happens, he said they’re not the primary driver for the bulk of business travel anyway.Furthermore, the pandemic will create new demand for business travel because of the boom in remote working creating ongoing need for distributed colleagues to travel to meet each other face to face, with Meir arguing that more flexible working is certainly here to stay.“My team, like many other teams, used to be all in Barcelona in the same building — and now we allow them to work from anywhere in the world. Because why not? Many companies will stick to that I think,” he said. “We have recognized that people like it, the employees like it and it’s cheaper, because you don’t have to have as much office real estate — and people are more productive and they’re happier and they have a better balance between their personal and work life.“So this requires a new type of travel because… you have to bring [your team] together for a week of work together. So I think the small decline in business travel due to this one hour transactional call that you can move to Zoom will be compensated even more — increased by — this new way of working that requires a new type of business travel.”While TravelPerk was fortunate enough to go into the pandemic well-capitalized, having topped up its Series C in 2019, investor interest in travel startups undoubtedly went on holiday for a considerable chunk of last year. But, again, Meir suggests, an uptick on that front.“We don’t need to raise any time soon — we have enough cash. The expectation is for the business to go back to growing year on year sometime in Q3, Q4 of this year,” he told us. “Having said that, what’s interesting — and I don’t know if I’m the only one — is we went from [being a fast-growing company] and you get a lot of inbound from investors and then COVID-19 hit and my inbox was empty for a while.“It was pretty sad, pretty pathetic. And then the last few weeks — since the beginning of the school year — September/October, my inbox is not empty anymore. So there is some movement in the market. There’s a lot of money looking for a home — for good investments. And I think even in an industry which is suffering obviously, the good companies can raise at good terms right now. So I’m not looking to raise but I’m always open to the opportunity.”On a growth tear, work trip SaaS TravelPerk adds $60M to its Series C']",Molotov,"['TravelPerk', 'NexTravel', 'NavigationClose', 'TravelPerk', 'Lomas@riptari', 'TravelPerk', 'NexTravel', 'NexTravel', 'Southwest Airlines', 'TravelPerk', 'Avi Meir', 'NexTravel', 'NexTravel’s', 'TravelPerk', 'Yelp, Stripe and Harry’s', 'COVID-19', 'TravelPerk’s', 'Meir', 'NexTravel', 'NexTravel', 'Meir', 'TravelPerk', 'TravelPerk', 'NexTravel', 'Crunchbase', 'Meir', 'TravelPerk', 'Zoom', 'Zoom', 'FOMO', 'Zoom', 'Zoom', 'Maslow’s Pyramid of Needs', 'Meir', 'Zoom', 'TravelPerk', 'Q3', 'TravelPerk', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropeFundings & ExitsM&ATCconsolidationCOVID-19NexTraveltravel', 'TravelPerk', 'TravelPerk', 'NexTravel', 'COVID-19', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/vMjzv0JLnE,2021-01-13T08:00:12,"App stores saw record 218 billion downloads in 2020, consumer spend of $143 billion","['Mobile adoption continued to grow in 2020, in part due to the market forces of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to App Annie’s annual “State of Mobile” industry report, mobile app downloads grew by 7% year-over-year to a record 218 billion in 2020. Meanwhile, consumer spending grew by 20% to also hit a new milestone of $143 billion, led by markets that included\xa0China, the United States, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom.Consumers also spent 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone, the report found.In another shift, app usage in the U.S. surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours on their mobile device.The increase in time spent is a trend that’s not unique to the U.S., but can be seen across several other countries, including both developing mobile markets like Indonesia, Brazil and India, as well as places like China, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., Germany, France and others.The trend isn’t isolated to any one demographic, either, but is seen across age groups. In the U.S., for example, Gen Z, millennials and Gen X/Baby Boomers spent 16%, 18% and 30% more time in their most-used apps year-over-year, respectively. However, what those favorite apps looked like was very different.For Gen Z in the U.S., top apps on Android phones included Snapchat, Twitch, TikTok, Roblox and Spotify.Millennials favored Discord, LinkedIn, PayPal, Pandora and Amazon Music.And Gen X/Baby Boomers used Ring, Nextdoor, The Weather Channel, Kindle and ColorNote Notepad Notes.The pandemic didn’t necessarily change how consumers were using apps in 2020, but rather accelerated mobile adoption by two to three years’ time, the report found.Investors were also eager to fuel mobile businesses as a result, pouring $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year. According to Crunchbase data, 26% of total global funding dollars in 2020 went to businesses that included a mobile solution.From 2016 to 2020, global funding to mobile technology companies more than doubled compared with the previous five years, and was led by financial services, transportation, commerce and shopping.Mobile gaming adoption also continued to grow in 2020. Casual games dominated the market in terms of downloads (78%), but Core games accounted for 66% of games’ consumer spend and 55% of the time spent.With many stuck inside due to COVID-19 lockdowns and quarantines, mobile games that offered social interaction boomed. Among Us, for example, became a breakout game in several markets in 2020, including the U.S.Other app categories saw sizable increases over the past year, as well.Time spent in Finance apps in 2020 was up 45% worldwide, outside of China, and participation in the stock market grew 55% on mobile, thanks to apps like Robinhood in the U.S. and others worldwide, that democratized investing and trading.TikTok had a big year, too.The app saw incredible 325% year-over-year growth, despite a ban in India, and ranked in the top five apps by time spent. The average monthly time spent per user also grew faster than nearly every other app analyzed, including 65% in the U.S. and 80% in the U.K., surpassing Facebook. TikTok is now on track to hit 1.2 billion active users in 2021, App Annie forecasts.Other video services boomed in 2020, thanks to a combination of new market entrants and a lot of time spent at home. Consumers spent 40% more hours streaming on mobile devices, with time spent in streaming apps peaking in the second quarter in the west as the pandemic forced people inside.YouTube benefitted from this trend, as it became the No. 1 streaming app by time spent among all markets analyzed except China. The time spent in YouTube is up to 6x that of the next closet app at 38 hours per month.Of course, another big story for 2020 was the rise of e-commerce amid the pandemic. This made the past year the biggest ever for mobile shopping, with an over 30% increase in time spent in Shopping apps, as measured on Android phones outside of China.Mobile commerce, however, looked less traditional in 2020.Social shopping was a big trend, with global downloads of Pinterest and Instagram growing 50% and 20% year-over-year, respectively.Livestreaming shopping grew, too, led by China. Downloads of live shopping TaoBao Live in China, Grip in South Korea and NTWRK in the U.S. grew 100%, 245% and 85%, respectively. NTWRK doubled in size last year, and now others are entering the space as well — including TikTok, to some extent.The pandemic also prompted increased usage of mobile ordering apps. In the U.S., Argentina, the U.K., Indonesia and Russia, the app grew by 60%, 65%, 70%, 80% and 105%, respectively, in Q4.Business apps, like Zoom and Google Meet among others, grew 275% in Q4, for example, as remote work and sometimes school, continued.The analysis additionally included lists of the top apps by downloads, spending and monthly active users (MAUs).Although TikTok had been topping year-end charts, Facebook continued to beat it in terms of MAUs. Facebook-owned apps controlled the top charts by MAUs, with Facebook at No. 1 followed by WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.TikTok, however, had more downloads than Facebook and ranked No. 2 by consumer spending, behind Tinder.The full report is available only as an online interactive experience this year, not a download. The report largely uses data from both the iOS App Store and Google Play, except where otherwise noted.']", best companies to work for in 2021,"['App', 'NavigationClose', 'ScreenApp', 'App Annie’s', 'Android', 'Gen Z', 'Gen X/Baby Boomers', 'Android', 'TikTok', 'Roblox', 'PayPal', 'Pandora', 'Amazon Music', 'Gen X/Baby Boomers', 'The Weather Channel', 'Kindle', 'Core', 'COVID-19', 'U.S.Other', 'Time', 'Finance', 'TikTok', 'App Annie', 'YouTube', 'YouTube', 'Android', 'Pinterest', 'Instagram', 'NTWRK', 'NTWRK', 'TikTok', 'TikTok', 'WhatsApp', 'Messenger', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'App Annie’s', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The American firm is the latest entrant to this market where scores of startups and institutes have launched digital offerings in recent years.The e-commerce giant, which has invested more than $6.5 billion in the world’s second-largest internet market, said Amazon Academy offers curated learning material, live lectures, mock tests and comprehensive assessments to help students learn and practice math, physics and chemistry and prepare for the Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE), a government-backed engineering entrance assessment conducted in India for admission to various engineering colleges in the country. About two million students take the JEE test each year.Tests offered on Amazon Academy are “designed to mirror the JEE experience helping students understand the nuances of the examination. Students will also benefit from shortcuts, mnemonics, tips, and tricks, equipping them with the necessary tools to retain concepts and solve questions effectively,” the company said in a press note.Amazon began testing Amazon Academy, previously known as JEE Ready, in India in mid-2019. Amazon Academy, available via its website and as an app for Android and iOS, is free and will remain so for the “next few months,” the company said.Image Credits: AmazonMore than 260 million children go to school in India and much of the population sees education as a key to economic progress and a better life. TechCrunch reported last month that Amazon was also looking to hire executives in India to launch Amazon Future Engineer, a program through which it aims to bring computer science education to underserved and underrepresented children and young adults, in India by this year.“Amazon Academy aims to bring high quality, affordable education to all, starting with those preparing for engineering entrance examinations. Our mission is to help students achieve their outcomes while also empowering educators and content partners reach millions of students. Our primary focus has been on content quality, deep learning analytics and student experience. This launch will help engineering aspirants prepare better and achieve the winning edge in JEE,” said Amol Gurwara, director, Education at Amazon India, in a statement.Amazon’s global rivals, Facebook and Google, have also made a push into India’s education market in recent years. Last year, Facebook partnered with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), a government body that oversees education in private and public schools in India, to launch a certified curriculum on digital safety and online well-being, and augmented reality for students and educators.Facebook also invested in Unacademy, a Bangalore-based startup that offers online learning classes. Google, which\xa0invested in Indian edtech startup Cuemath, also partnered with CBSE\xa0to train more than 1 million teachers in India and offer a range of free tools such as G Suite for Education, Google Classroom and YouTube to help digitize the education experience in the nation.India’s top edtech startups — Byju’s, Unacademy and Vedantu — also offer students classes to prepare for the JEE test. Last year, these startups onboarded tens of millions of students to their platforms after the coronavirus outbreak prompted New Delhi to shut down schools across the nation.

The company is working with CITIC Securities to prepare for its planned listing, according to an announcement posted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on Tuesday.The move came more than a year after Megvii, known for its computer vision platform Face++, filed to go public in Hong Kong in August 2019. At the time, Reuters reported that the company could raise between $500 million and $1 billion. However, the firm’s IPO application in Hong Kong has lapsed for undisclosed reasons and its focus is now on Shanghai’s STAR board, a person with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch.In 2019, China established the STAR board to attract high-growth, unprofitable Chinese tech startups after losing them to the U.S. for years. In the meantime, a domestic flotation is increasingly appealing to Chinese firms, especially those that count on government contracts and are caught in the U.S.-China tech competition.Megvii and its rivals SenseTime, Yitu and CloudWalk are collectively recognized as the “Four AI Dragons” of China for their market dominance and fundings from highflying investors. Megvii’s technology can be found powering smart city infrastructure across China as well as many smartphones and mobile apps. Alibaba, Ant Group and the Bank of China are among the group of investors who have pumped about $1.4 billion into the 10-year-old company since its inception.The AI Dragons are less celebrated outside their home market. Last year, Megvii, Yitu and SenseTime were added to the U.S. Entity List for their alleged roles in enabling the government’s mass surveillance of the Muslim minority groups in western China. CloudWalk was subsequently added to the blacklist in 2020 and cut off from its U.S. suppliers.According to the notice posted by China’s securities authority, Megvii plans to issue Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs), which are similar to American depositary receipts and allow domestic investors to hold overseas shares. That suggests the Beijing-based AI unicorn has not ruled out listing outside mainland China.This week, Hong Kong-listed Lenovo, one of the world’s top PC makers, has also announced plans to sell shares through CDRs on the Shanghai tech board.Currently seeking guidance in the pre-application stage, Megvii’s planned listing still needs approval from Chinese regulators.China opens Nasdaq-style board to lure tech firms back home']",surveyed by Pew Research,"['NavigationClose', 'MegviiMegvii', 'CITIC Securities', 'the China Securities Regulatory Commission', 'Reuters', 'Shanghai’s STAR', 'STAR', 'Yitu', 'Megvii’s', 'Ant Group', 'the Bank of China', 'The AI Dragons', 'Megvii', 'AI', 'Lenovo', 'Megvii’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CITIC Securities', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

First, the service will be available in seven African countries, starting with Ivory Coast where it’s already live, Senegal in January, Cameroon in February, Burkina Faso in March, Tunisia in April and Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo after that.“When it comes to features, the service is more or less the same but content is different,” co-founder and CEO Jean-David Blanc told me. Molotov is betting on local partnerships to launch its service in new countries.In today’s case, Molotov is partnering with Digital Virgo, a mobile payments company available in 40 countries. Digital Virgo is handling the relationships with local content owners. Molotov is taking care of operations and the tech stack.There will be 15 channels at launch, such as Nina TV, Passions TV, Trace Urban, Trace Africa, Trace Urban Africa, Savannah TV, Gametoon, Africanews, Euronews, France24, Trace Sport Stars and DocuBox. Molotov will also grant access to its ad-supported on-demand streaming service Mango.Image Credits: MolotovIn order to support its international expansion plans, the startup had to rework its infrastructure so that it’s more robust — it relies more on cloud hosting and it is partnering with more CDN companies.

Misinformation is difficult to fight, and 73% of Americans surveyed by Pew Research ahead of the presidential election expressed little or no confidence in the ability of major tech companies to keep their platforms from being misused. The open-source Starling Framework for Data Integrity was launched to protect the veracity of online content using blockchain technology, creating “birth certificates” for photos and videos and tracking any changes made to them. Numbers Protocol, a Taipei, Taiwan-based startup is now commercializing its tech to make it more widely available.An active contributor to the Starling Framework, Numbers Protocol’s new blockchain camera app Capture App is not part of the initiative, but was inspired by its mission to preserve data integrity. The company is currently presenting Capture App during CES at the Taiwan Tech Arena pavilion. The app is available for download in the App Store and Google Play.While journalism, especially citizen journalism, is an obvious use case for Capture App, it also can be used by people who want to prove that they created images that are being shared online. Numbers will add more features to the app, including a video camera.A screenshot of blockchain camera app Capture App by Taiwan startup Numbers ProtocolAll photos taken by the Capture App have their metadata certified and sealed on the blockchain (users can adjust privacy settings if they, for example, don’t want to share their precise location). Then any changes to the photo, including ones made with editing software, are traced and recorded.Numbers plans to add a video function to the app and create a channel where people can publish certified content, with the goal of changing the information industry, co-founder Tammy Yang told TechCrunch.Before launching Numbers, Yang worked with the Starling Framework, which was jointly developed by the USC Shoah Foundation and Stanford University’s Department of Electrical Engineering.\xa0The USC Shoah Foundation’s work includes preserving testimonies from survivors of genocide and mass violence and the Starling Framework’s technology was created to help them safeguard photos and videos. The Starling Framework was also used by Reuters journalists to capture, verify and store photos taken during the U.S. presidential primaries in March. (The Starling Framework’s other collaborators include FileCoin, Hala Systems, Protocol Labs and Hedera, among others.)The Starling Framework worked with the USC Shoah Foundation and Reuters to integrate its technology into their workflows, since many photojournalists use digital SLRs and programs like Adobe Photoshop. Capture App was created to allow its users access to similar verification functionality and preserve the integrity of their own data, based on the work being done with the Starling Framework.Fake news and misinformation has created more public awareness of the need to preserve photo integrity, said Yang. While there are other companies that use blockchain tech to protect data and content, Numbers focuses on certifying photos at their point of origin, and then continuing to record any alterations.“We focus very much on the camera itself, so at the time the photo is taken, the integrity is already preserved,” said Yang. “If content is captured on a camera app and then copied to a content platform, it’s already very difficult to verify its origin. If I take a photo from Facebook and register it on the blockchain, it means nothing. It’s very different if I take a photo with Capture App and immediately create a registration on the blockchain.”']",filed suit to block the acquisition,"['Numbers Protocol’s', 'NavigationClose', 'Shu@catherineshu', 'Pew Research', 'the Starling Framework', 'Capture', 'Capture', 'CES', 'Capture', 'Capture', 'Numbers ProtocolAll', 'Capture', 'Numbers', 'Tammy Yang', 'Numbers', 'Yang', 'the USC Shoah Foundation', 'Stanford University’s Department of Electrical Engineering', 'The USC Shoah Foundation’s', 'the Starling Framework’s', 'Reuters', 'The Starling Framework’s', 'FileCoin', 'Hala Systems', 'the USC Shoah Foundation', 'Reuters', 'Adobe Photoshop', 'App', 'the Starling Framework', 'Yang', 'Numbers', 'Yang', 'Capture', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Pew Research', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/o4kGSHxCEX,2021-01-13T01:01:52,"Signal’s Brian Acton talks about exploding growth, monetization and WhatsApp data-sharing outrage","['Brian Acton is crossing paths again with Facebook. Over more than a decade of building and operating WhatsApp, the company’s co-founder first competed against and then sold his instant messaging app to the social juggernaut. Only a few years ago he parted ways with the company that made him a billionaire in a bitter split over messaging and privacy.Now Acton says the ongoing outrage over what Facebook has done to the messaging service he helped build is driving people to his latest project — Signal. Acton, who serves as the executive chairman of the privacy-conscious messaging app’s holding company, told TechCrunch in an interview that the user base of Signal has “exploded” in recent weeks.“The smallest of events helped trigger the largest of outcomes,” said Acton on a video call. “We’re also excited that we are having conversations about online privacy and digital safety and people are turning to Signal as the answer to those questions.”Elon Musk dunks on Facebook and recommends Signal in wake of US Capitol insurrection attempt“It’s a great opportunity for Signal to shine and to give people a choice and alternative. It was a slow burn for three years and then a huge explosion. Now the rocket is going,” he said.The event Acton is referring to is the recent change in data-sharing policy disclosed by WhatsApp, an app that serves more than 2 billion users worldwide.Through an in-app alert, WhatsApp has asked users in recent days to agree to new terms of conditions that grants the app the consent to share their personal data with Facebook. Users will have to agree to these terms by February 8 if they wish to continue using the app, the alert said.Acton said WhatsApp is grappling with incorporating monetization features while still protecting people’s privacy. And its new “complicated policy” has forced WhatsApp and the media to scramble for explanations and “everyone is confused.”Acton did not disclose how many users Signal has amassed in recent weeks, but he said the app currently ranks at the top on App Store in 40 countries and on Google Play Store in 18 countries. (Signal is not the only app that users have explored in recent days as their new home. Telegram said on Tuesday noon that more than 25 million users had joined the platform in the last 72 hours. The app now has over 525 million monthly active users.)WhatsApp hits 2 billion users, up from 1.5 billion 2 years agoAccording to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch, Signal had about 20 million monthly active users globally at the end of December 2020. According to Sensor Tower, the app was downloaded more than 7.5 million times between January 6 and January 10.Since its inception in 2018, Signal has promised that it won’t sell its users’ data and that it won’t show its users ads. In 2018, Acton invested $50 million in Signal Foundation, a check that he said helped get the ball rolling. But how does the messaging app plan to stay afloat in the future?Signal today also relies on donations to bankroll the business — and more users mean more donors, he said. “If Signal gets to a billion users, that’s a billion donors. All we have to do is get you so excited about Signal that you want to give us a dollar or 50 rupees. The idea is that we want to earn that donation. The only way to earn that donation is building an innovative and delightful product. That’s a better relationship in my opinion,” he said.Acton said this model has worked for the business, which keeps a small staff of below 50. Between its frugal spending and the foundation’s largesse, Signal still has some money in the bank.Signal Foundation has also previously said that messenger is its first product, and like Mozilla and Wikimedia Foundation, it intends to expand to more categories. Acton said in the coming years, the team will take a call on whether they want to work on email and storage products, but he said the current focus remains on the messaging app.Even as Acton has publicly urged users to get off Facebook, in our conversation he did not suggest that people should stop using WhatsApp. On the contrary, Acton said he envisions people relying on Signal for conversations with their family and close friends, and using WhatsApp for other chats. “I have no desire to do all the things that WhatsApp does. My desire is to give people a choice,” he said. “Otherwise, you’re locked into something where you have no choice. It’s not strictly a winner take-all scenario.”One of the criticisms that WhatsApp often receives is that it does not do enough to curb the spread of false information on its platform, which has resulted in real-life casualties. I asked Acton what Signal, which also protects its users’ conversations with end-to-end encryption, would do if people started to use his app for a similar purpose. Acton said it’s a difficult challenge and while technology and platform have their own share of responsibilities, they can only do so much especially when you can’t look at the content of the conversation.“You should be teaching your children good digital responsibility. Don’t just immediately take the information that you get. Understand its source. Understand who are trusted sources. As a society, teach every member how it works,” he said, pointing to earlier days of the internet when email scams were rampant and with time and education people learned how to identify them.']",Future Ventures,"['Brian Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'NavigationClose ScreenSignal’s', 'Brian Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'Phillip Faraone', 'WhatsApp', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Musk', 'Signal', 'attempt“It’s', 'Signal', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Signal', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'App Annie', 'Signal', 'Sensor Tower', 'Signal', 'Signal Foundation', 'Signal', 'Signal', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Signal Foundation', 'Mozilla', 'Wikimedia Foundation', 'Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'Acton', 'Signal', 'Acton', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Brian Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'Singh2:01 AM', 'Acton', 'WhatsApp', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

TripActions has not returned emails seeking comment.Earlier today, Lime asked TripActions to remove Trump properties from showing up in a search if one of its employees is booking corporate travel, according to an internal email written by Lime CEO Wayne Ting and sent to the rest of the staff.“While some startups have argued that companies should never be political, we have always understood that the work we do here at Lime is inherently political,” Ting wrote. “We are speaking out and standing up for what we believe is right because that is the right thing to do. And we are looking for ways to ensure our actions — and dollars — don’t support those who are complicit in this attack on our democracy.”Lime has not made any political contributions to date, according to the email. (TechCrunch confirmed with Lime that it hasn’t made any federal political contributions.) Ting wrote that the company will never support any elected official who voted to challenge the certification of the results of the Electoral College. He then went further, extending it to the Trump Organization, a real estate portfolio that includes hotels, golf properties and resorts as well as residential holdings like Trump Tower.“Moreover, we are committing to never support or spend money at any of the business ventures and affiliates of the Trump and Kushner families,” Ting wrote. “In fact, earlier today, we asked TripActions to remove all Trump properties from Lime search results and encouraged them to institute this policy for all of their customers.”Here’s the complete email, which TechCrunch has viewed:I know many of us watched last week’s events in Washington DC in shock and horror. The bedrock of any democracy is the peaceful transfer of power based on the will of the people.\xa0It was horrific to see a mob of insurrectionists — including white supremacists, neo-nazis, and conspiracy theorists — spurred on by the President, storm the halls of Congress to undermine and overturn that most sacred democratic ritual through violence and intimidation.\xa0The day was made even more disturbing by the stark contrast in police response between last week’s violent riots and last summer’s overwhelmingly peaceful protests for racial justice. If the rioters last week had been black and brown and held high the flag of Black Lives Matter instead of Donald Trump and the Confederacy, would they have been allowed to overrun the Capitol, ransacked offices, and walked back out the front door in their own volition? The unfortunate thing is the answer is self-evident.\xa0\xa0As more information became available over the last few days, it’s also clear that President Trump and certain Members of Congress still do not comprehend the gravity of their offenses, show appropriate remorse for inciting such unbelievable violence, or commit to ensure they never happen again.\xa0While some startups have argued that companies should never be political, we have always understood that the work we do here at Lime is inherently political. We are speaking out and standing up for what we believe is right because that is the right thing to do. And we are looking for ways to ensure our actions — and dollars — don’t support those who are complicit in this attack on our democracy.We signed on to PFNYC’s letter calling for Congress to certify the results of the Presidential election ahead of the unrest. And while we have not made political donations to date, we are committing now to never support any elected official who voted to challenge the certification of the results of the Electoral College.\xa0Moreover, we are committing to never support or spend money at any of the business ventures and affiliates of the Trump and Kushner families. In fact, earlier today, we asked TripActions to remove all Trump properties from Lime search results and encouraged them to institute this policy for all of their customers.I know these events have been difficult to watch, painful to comprehend, and deeply hurtful on the most personal level for many of our colleagues.

https://t.co/4YBA1QGX4l,2021-01-12T23:07:25,Companies rush to replace the gym at CES,"['The year of the first-ever all-virtual CES is, unsurprisingly, the year of the virtual gym. The past 12 months have seen most of our fitness routines completely transformed — speaking for myself, my Apple Watch step count shows two big empty spots where March and April are.Fitness startups have seen unexpected windfall in all of this. In June, Lululemon announced plans to acquire Mirror for $500 million, while competitors like Tonal saw a 7x increase in sales for the year. In December, Apple launched Fitness+, its own on-demand service designed to take on the Pelotons of the world.It’s hard to shake the feeling that we’re starting to see a streaming service-style land rush on the fitness side of things. It’s a massive industry, of course, and odds are things will never return exactly to “normal” in the wake of all of this, but unlike movie services, it’s hard to imagine people subscribing to more than one at a time.Lululemon set to acquire home fitness startup Mirror for $500MPerhaps the biggest name to enter the market thus far at CES is Samsung. The electronics giant announced Smart Trainer, an addition to its growing line of fitness-focused apps. The system is designed specially for Samsung’s Smart TVs, using a webcam to track exercises. On that front, at least, it seems to be a bit more in-depth than Apple’s Watch-only tracking, which relies on an accelerometer and heart-rate monitor for feedback. Like Fitness+, it will employ trainers to lead exercises, including workout celebrity Jillian Michaels.Ultrahuman is another major fitness video platform making its debut this week. The startup recently closed an $8 million round. Like Fitness+, its biotracking is built around the Apple Watch, showcasing heart rate and calories burned, among other metrics. The service compares its offering to a “masterclass” for fitness.Partners include leading athletes and celebrities like Crossfit champion Kara Saunders, fitness celebrity Amanda Cerny, coach Johannes Bartl, hybrid athlete and coach Kris Gethin and MindSize CEO Christian Straka to name a few. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app also integrates biofeedback via its Apple Watch integration to measure and improve the efficacy of meditation and workouts. Compared to Calm and Headspace’s celebrity content approach, Ultrahuman uses a technology platform-based approach to improve experience and long-term results.It won’t replace the gym, but Fitness+ will help you break a sweatThese services set themselves apart from the likes of Mirror, Peloton and new offerings from the likes of NordicTrack, in that these technologies ditch the heavy exercise equipment, lowering the barrier of entry (though I suppose Samsung’s does require a big, expensive TV). The fact is that demand will decrease when people feel more comfortable going to the gym. That will certainly shake out the industry to a certain extent.For many people, however, once the secrets of home fitness have been unlocked, they may never want to visit the gym again.']",Techstars,"['NavigationClose', 'CES', 'Apple Watch', 'Lululemon', 'Mirror', 'Apple', 'the Pelotons of the world', 'Mirror', 'CES', 'Samsung', 'Smart Trainer', 'Samsung', 'Smart', 'Apple’s Watch', 'Jillian Michaels', 'the Apple Watch', 'Kara Saunders', 'Amanda Cerny', 'Johannes Bartl', 'Kris Gethin', 'MindSize', 'Christian Straka', 'Android', 'Apple Watch', 'Ultrahuman', 'Mirror, Peloton', 'NordicTrack', 'Samsung’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CES', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/9RyUjzSCYQ,2021-01-12T22:34:41,"Steve Jurvetson and Maryanna Saenko on their new fund, SPACs and the great tech exodus","[""Future Ventures — cofounded by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson and Maryanna Saenko, a colleague of Jurvetson at his last firm, DFJ, as well as an investor previously with Airbus Ventures and Khosla Ventures — has closed its second fund with $200 million in capital commitments, say the pair.In a wide-ranging conversation yesterday afternoon (you can hear it here), Jurvetson characterized the fund as “dramatically oversubscribed in a fairly short period of time,” adding that roughly one-third of its investors are venture capitalists or other investors, that the “second largest bucket [comprises] tech executives, CEOs, and former CEOs of enormous companies of relevance to our ecosystem” and that the last third of the firm’s capital is coming from institutions, including one university endowment. (He didn’t specify which.)As with Future’s $200 million debut fund, which closed two years ago, the outfit’s newest vehicle has a 15-year time horizon, giving it more leeway to make longer-term bets. Jurvetson also confirmed that as with that debut fund, Future features fairly standard economics, including charging 2.5% in management fees and 25% in so-called carried interest (meaning the share of the profits that Future keeps from its investments).“We tell our LPs, ‘Look, this is a long game, these companies take longer than five to seven years to come to full maturity,'” said Jurvetson, who has been on the board of SpaceX since 2009 and, along with three other directors, left the board of Tesla in September, following a 13-year run as a director. “They may go public in that timeframe. But as you can see with Tesla and SpaceX and some of the greatest tech stories of our day, you would regret having feel pressured to punch out early when they’re really in the greatest phases of torrid growth.”Undoubtedly, Future’s new fund could have been bigger. Jurvetson has been doing business with Elon Musk for more than 20 years, and beyond his early involvement with SpaceX and Tesla, Future participated in the first round of Musk’s tunnel-based transportation system, Boring Company.The firm also wrote the first check to Musk’s neurotechnology startup, Neuralink, which last summer unveiled its progress toward developing implantable brain-computer interfaces that include thousands of electrodes that Musk thinks will eventually help to cure conditions like Alzheimer’s and dementia, among other things.Though SpaceX is now an 18-year-old company, Future has a stake in that business, too. In fact, Future’s first check went to Space X, and the firm last year raised a $100 million SpaceX SPV (special purpose vehicle) in just five days — capital that Saenko said came from most of the fund’s investors, who were given the option of participating if they wanted.These pop-up type funds won’t happen routinely, according to Jurvetson. “We communicated in our fundraising that a special situation, maybe two, would occur where we do a later-stage, large check, single investment in a company we have immense conviction in, and we didn’t anticipate that to happen right away, but the opportunity to reopen the prior year’s round [in SpaceX] and join an extension of that close made it very tempting to do on behalf of the fund.”The broader plan is to continue committing smaller amounts to startups — $3.8 million on average — and for that funding to be the first that the teams raise. Future intends to invest in roughly 20 companies altogether from the new fund — as with the last — and to take a more relaxed view on board seats than might other firms.Part of that owes to necessity, suggests Saenko, noting that she and Jurvetson only have so much bandwidth. But she also said she could “not think of a single situation where we’re not fully in the information flow of the company” even without a director role, which is often why VCs insist on one.In the meantime, well beyond its Musk-related bets,\xa0Future has been assembling a portfolio that’s wide-ranging, with investments tied to cellular manufacturing, longevity, and edge AI, among other things.It just led a follow-on round in Sensei Biotherapeutics, a 21-year-old, Boston-based developer of personalized cancer drugs that’s planning a public offering this year and which uses bacteriophage to induce an adaptive immune response.Future — which is also investor in the lab-grown meat producer Memphis Meats — is also very focused right now on regenerative agriculture and permaculture, which is an approach to land management that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems.Said Saenko, “I think it would behoove all of us to look at our food industry and ask what are the ways in which we are currently feeding our global population that are unsustainable in the future, given the number of people that we have and are going to continue having on this planet.”What doesn’t interest the pair remotely are other trends sweeping the venture industry right now, from space investing to moving from California.On space investing, Jurvetson — who led DFJ’s investment in both SpaceX and the satellite company Planet — said it’s far too crowded now (“though I’m going to be a space tourist one day for sure”).As for moving — as Musk did recently to Austin — Saenko isn’t going anywhere, she said. Neither is Jurvetson, who spent 12 years in Texas, including in high school, and has no interest in returning.“Sadly,” he said yesterday, “many of my friends have punched out and gone to Texas or Florida.” He berates them for it, too, he said, explaining: “If you become wealthy enough as an investor or an entrepreneur such that you could choose to live anywhere you want in your life, why in the world would you pick up and go to some godforsaken place now? Just to avoid capital gains tax? How about, for example, donate to charity instead and avoid that capital gains tax?”There is a “different way to look at the world rather than just trying to do wealth transfer and preservation across generations,” he said. “That just feels so short-sighted to me.”And don’t even get them started on the blank-check companies that have come into vogue as a path for more automotive companies in particular to become publicly traded. For example, Lucid Motors, the California EV startup that gave up majority ownership to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund last year in exchange for $1.3 billion, is reportedly in talks to go public through a merger with one of the special purpose acquisition vehicles of Wall Street veteran Michael Klein.Faraday Future, another electric vehicle startup, is reportedly looking to go public via a merger with a separate SPAC sponsor.Asked what Future Ventures makes of the trend, Jurvetson — who experienced a high-profile split from DFJ in 2017 (DFJ has continued on as DFJ Growth) —\xa0 did not mince words about the electric vehicle category especially. “It would be really refreshing if a decent company was included in the mix, but it is just a rogue’s gallery of horrific companies.”Mostly, he continued, “these are companies that are unable to raise a penny from any other source” at this point in their trajectory.Saenko was more diplomatic if no more optimistic about some of the related deals being struck right now.“We’re not saying that every SPAC company is a terrible company,” she said. “I think what we’re saying is that everyone should be very wary of these companies because of Steve’s point that they’re early-stage companies and the SPAC is solely a fundraising system.”Public market investors “expect a particular level of maturity and progress and meaningful forecasting from the companies that are on the public markets,” she added, “and that’s just not going to be true of the vast majority of the companies that have gone through SPACs. And that could have a potentially terrible blowback on the entire tech industry.”""]",Share on Twitter ,"['Steve Jurvetson', 'Maryanna Saenko', 'Maryanna Saenko', 'Dani Padgett', 'Steve Jurvetson', 'Maryanna Saenko', 'DFJ', 'Airbus Ventures', 'Khosla Ventures', 'Jurvetson', 'Future’s', 'Jurvetson', 'Tesla', 'Elon Musk', 'Musk', 'Boring Company', 'Neuralink', 'Musk', 'Future', 'SPV', 'Jurvetson', 'Musk', 'AI', 'Sensei Biotherapeutics', 'Memphis Meats', 'Said Saenko', 'DFJ’s', 'Musk', 'Jurvetson', 'Lucid Motors', 'the California EV', 'Michael Klein', 'Faraday Future', 'DFJ', 'DFJ', 'DFJ Growth', 'Saenko', 'SPAC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Maryanna Saenko', 'Steve Jurvetson', 'Maryanna Saenko', 'DFJ', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

However, the Department of Justice filed suit to block the deal in November of 2020, arguing that the combination would “eliminate a nascent competitive threat that would likely result in substantial savings and more innovative online debit services for merchants and consumers.”At the time Visa argued that the government’s point of view was “flawed.”However, today the two companies confirmed the deal is officially off. In a release Visa wrote that it could have eventually executed the deal, but that “protracted and complex litigation” would take lots of time to sort out.It all got too hard, in other words.Plaid’s Zach Perret: ‘Every company is a fintech company’Plaid was a bit more upbeat in its own notes, writing that in the last year it has seen “an unprecedented uptick in demand for the services powered by Plaid.” Given the fintech boom that 2020 saw, as consumers flocked to free stock trading apps and neobanks, that Plaid saw growth last year is not surprising. After all, Plaid’s product sits between consumers and fintech companies, so if those parties were executing more transactions, the API startup likely saw more demand for its own offerings.TechCrunch reached out to Plaid for comment on its plans as an independent company, also asking how quickly it grew during 2020. Update: Plaid responded to TechCrunch noting that it saw 60% customer growth in 2020, bringing it to more than 4,000 clients. If we presume even moderate net dollar retention amongst its customer base, Plaid could have grown by triple-digits last year, in percentage terms.While the Visa-Plaid deal was merely a single transaction, its scuttling doesn’t bode well for other fintech startups and unicorns that might have eyed an exit to a wealthy incumbent. The Department of Justice, in other words, may have undercut the chances of M&A exits for a number of fintech-focused startups or at least created more skittishness around that possible exit path.If so, expected exit valuations for fintech upstarts could fall. And that could ding both fintech-focused venture capital activity, and the price at which startups in the niche can raise funds. If the Visa-Plaid deal was a huge boon to fintech companies that used it as a signpost to help raise money at new, higher valuations, the inverse may also prove true.Visa is acquiring Plaid for $5.3 billion, 2x its final private valuation\xa0']",You & Mr. Jones,"['Visa', 'VC', 'Sarah Wardlaw', 'the Department of Justice', 'Visa', 'Visa', 'The Department of Justice', 'Visa', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCdepartment', 'ArticleVisa', 'Alex Wilhelm10:35 PM', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/v2r7Y3cHMP,2021-01-12T21:28:20,Sono Motors plans to license the tech that powers its solar electric car,"['Sono Motors wants to bring technology it developed for its solar electric car to the masses. And it’s starting with autonomous shuttle startup EasyMile.The German-based startup said Tuesday during a presentation at the virtual 2021 CES tech trade show that it will license its solar body panel technology to other companies. EasyMile, which provides electric autonomous shuttle buses to governments, universities and other companies, will be the first to integrate the solar body panels onto its vehicles, according to Sono Motors co-founder and CEO Laurin Hahn, who made the announcement after the company’s next-generation Sion solar electric car was revealed.From afar, the Sono Motors’ electric Sion vehicle looks like a compact car with black paint. Upon closer inspection, the entire exterior of the vehicle is actually comprised of hundreds of solar cells that have been integrated into polymer instead of glass.This makes them lighter, robust, cheaper and more efficient than any other technology available at the present in the markets, according to Arun Ramakrishnan, senior solar integration manager at Sono Motors, who added that they can be integrated into almost any object.\xa0The solar body panels are lightweight — comparable to traditional body panels on today’s modern cars — and the polymer coating prevents the cells from splintering, the company said.These solar cells convert sunlight into energy, which is stored in the vehicle’s battery. The solar cells, which work if a vehicle is driving or parked, can add up nearly 21.7 miles of range per day on the Sion car, the company said, noting that these stats are based on average weather in Munich.The aim is to make vehicles less dependent on charging infrastructure, Hahn said.Image Credits: Sono Motors/screenshotThe solar body panels aren’t designed to replace traditional charging methods. However, it can reduce how often the vehicle needs to be plugged in. Sono Motors noted that the solar integration in the Sion car extends the need to plug in from once a week to every four weeks, stats based on an average daily commute in Germany of 10 miles.Sono Motors showed Tuesday a trailer outfitted with the solar body panels, just one use case for the technology. The trailer, which is just a prototype, is capable of\xa0generating up to 80 kilowatt hours per day.“Just imagine the massive potential,” Ramakrishnan said, noting that the tech could be used by refrigerated trucks or other fleets.']",working to combine those ratings with streaming data,"['Sono Motors', 'NavigationClose', 'Sono MotorsSono Motors', 'Sono Motors', 'Laurin Hahn', 'the Sono Motors’', 'Arun Ramakrishnan', 'Sono Motors', 'Hahn', 'Sono Motors', 'Sono Motors', 'Sono Motors', 'Ramakrishnan', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'MotorsSono Motors', 'carKirsten Korosec10:28 PM', '2021Sono Motors', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/4blBvQiyMk,2021-01-12T21:05:07,Techstars names Maëlle Gavet CEO as the accelerator group looks to expand,"['This morning Techstars, a network of startup accelerators and a venture capital fund, announced that Maëlle Gavet is its new CEO. Former CEO and co-founder David Brown will stay on Techstars’ board, while the group’s other co-founder, David Cohen, will become the chairman of its board.TechCrunch spoke with Gavet this morning about her new job, the timing of the change, the company’s plans for expansion and her goals in the role.Gavet, who said she was brought aboard to help Techstars grow, detailed her work experience at prior roles in companies of greater scale and multiple geographies, including Compass and Booking.com.TechCrunch was curious how large the startup market is, and how much space is left in different geographies and niches for Techstars and others to expand into. Gavet said that she had asked the same question to Techstars when she was being recruited for her new role. She said there is a wealth of overlooked talent and underinvested geographies that could be empowered and unlocked with capital and help. Techstars wants to go find those founders and invest in them. Update: The language in this paragraph was edited after publication for clarity.That means, we presume, more accelerators in more places investing in more founders.Gavet told TechCrunch that Techstars has invested in over 2,300 companies and is putting capital into around 500 yearly.The new CEO explained that she believes it is possible to generate strong returns for her investors while providing lots of support for entrepreneurs and having a positive social impact. That’s an ambitious list of things to execute at once, but if she succeeds her effort could help diversify the world of tech entrepreneurs, something that has long been needed.Seeing a startup exchange leaders to optimize for different, and larger-scale, operating experience is not rare. For a meta-startup, an accelerator-and-investing concern, to do the same is not surprising.TechCrunch regularly covers accelerator cohorts, including Techstars (some recent notes here) and Y Combinator, among other programs. Some of tech’s biggest names have come out of such accelerator groups, historically, including Airbnb (now public) from Michael Seibel-led Y Combinator, TalkDesk (worth over $3 billion) from Christine Tsai-led 500 Startups, and Techstars’ own SendGrid (bought by Twilio for $2 billion).It will be interesting to see where Techstars takes its accelerator model next — the group sometimes partners with companies, or groups like the United States Air Force to sponsor and support tailored programs — in terms of location and focus. But if it can successfully help diversify the founder pool at the same time as making itself money, it will underscore how others in its market could do better.Airbnb’s first-day pop caps off a stellar week for tech IPOs']",Nacelle,"['Maëlle Gavet', 'NavigationClose', 'Maëlle Gavet', 'Techstars', 'Maëlle Gavet', 'David Brown', 'Techstars’', 'David Cohen', 'Techstars', 'Compass', 'Booking.com', 'Techstars', 'Gavet', 'Techstars', 'Techstars', 'Techstars', 'Techstars', 'Michael Seibel', 'TalkDesk', 'Christine Tsai-led', 'Techstars', 'SendGrid', 'Twilio', 'Techstars', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsStartupsTCMaelle GavetTechStarsTechstars', 'Maëlle Gavet', 'Techstars', 'Maëlle Gavet', 'David Brown', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Cloud-based infrastructure promises more flexibility, scale and cost-effectiveness, as well as enables enterprises to have more agile application development and keep up with service demand. \n\t\t\tWhat’s clear is that despite shortfalls in security, innovation in cloud and infrastructure will charge ahead.\t\t\t\t\tEven with all of the hype and excitement around cloud’s potential, it is still early days. In his recent keynote at AWS re:Invent, the AWS CEO Andy Jassy mentioned that spending on cloud computing is still only 4% of the overall IT market. And a Barclays CIO survey found that enterprises have 30% of their workloads running in the public cloud, with the expectation to increase to 39% in 2021.It’s become clear that the movement to cloud has its barriers and that large enterprises are often skittish to make the jump. Flexera’s State of the Cloud 2020 report outlined some of these top cloud challenges, citing security as #1. This has been widely apparent in conversations that I’ve had with Fortune 500 CISOs and security teams, who are wary of the shift from their current state of security operations. Some of the major concerns brought up include:No longer your own master. When working with the public cloud providers, companies must relinquish control to some aspects of back-end management. This is tough for large enterprises who have a history of customizing products because you can’t completely tailor the environment to your liking and are limited to what’s on the cloud service provider’s platform.Lack of standardization. Each cloud provider has their own solutions and own intricacies. Add to that other pitfalls, like an unknown cadence of updates, there is an opaqueness to interoperability and policies can’t be uniformly applied across environments.Requires a new skill set. Lack of resources/expertise ranks among the top challenges for enterprises. A recent report on challenges in cloud transformation found that 86% of IT decision-makers believe shortage of talent will slow down 2020 cloud projects.']","June’s third-gen smart oven goes up for pre-order, starting at $599","['Rizky Panuntun', 'Getty ImagesKelley', 'Twitter Kelley Mak', 'COVID-19', 'Andy Jassy', 'Barclays CIO', 'Flexera’s State', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

After having served as the CEO of ad giant Havas, Jones told me that his goal in starting what he called “a brand tech group” was to provide marketers with something that neither traditional agencies nor technology companies could give them.“At that moment, the choices were to go work with an agency group, which is great at brand and marketing, but they don’t understand tech, or with a tech company, which will only ever recommend their platform and don’t have the same [brand and marketing] expertise,” he said.So You & Mr. Jones has built its own technology platform to help marketers with their digital, mobile and e-commerce needs, while also investing in companies like Pinterest and Niantic. And it makes acquisitions — last year, for example, it bought influencer marketing company Collectively.Former Ad Exec David Jones Launches $350 Million “Brandtech” GroupYou & Mr. Jones has grown to 3,000 employees, and its clients include Unilever, Accenture, Google, Adidas, Marriott and Microsoft. In fact, Jones said that as of the third quarter of 2020, its net revenue had grown 27% year over year.That’s particularly impressive given the impact of the pandemic on ad spending, but Jones said that’s one of the key distinctions between digital advertising and the broader brand tech category, which he said has grown steadily, even during the pandemic, and which also sets the company apart from agencies that are “digital and tech in press release only.”“We’re not an ad agency, we’ll never acquire agencies,” he said. “We have the technology platform, process and people to deliver all of your end-to-end, always-on content — social, digital, e-commerce and community management.”In addition to the funding, the company is announcing that it has hired Paulette Forte, who was previously senior director of human services at the NBA, as its first chief people officer.“The brand tech category didn’t even exist before You & Mr Jones was established,” Forte said in a statement. “The company became a true industry disruptor in short order, and growth has been swift. In order to keep up with the momentum, it’s critical to have systems in place that help talent develop their skills, encourage diversity and creativity, and find pathways to improving workflow.

https://t.co/gUq1HwREV1,2021-01-12T20:15:07,Nielsen says ‘The Office’ was the most popular streaming series of 2020,"['Because streaming services only release viewership numbers selectively, and because each one uses its own methodology, it can be hard to compare the popularity of different streaming shows and movies.So Nielsen, which provides the standard ratings for traditional TV (and is working to combine those ratings with streaming data), is offering some apples-to-apples comparison today at CES by releasing its own lists of the most popular streaming content in 2020, across Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and Hulu.These lists are limited to U.S. viewership. Unlike Nielsen’s linear ratings, they don’t just reflect the total number of people watching, but focus instead on the total number of minutes watched. That also makes for a striking contrast with the ratings that Netflix releases, which count the number of households who watched at least two minutes of a program, but don’t distinguish between someone who watches two minutes versus two hours versus 20 hours.Still, the TV series lists are absolutely dominated by Netflix, while Disney+ puts in a good showing on the movies list. The other services don’t crack any of the three Top 10 lists.On the original series side, the surprising winner (at least, surprising to me) was Netflix’s “Ozark,” with 30.5 billion minutes streamed, followed by “Lucifer” (19 billion minutes) and “The Crown” (16.3 billion minutes). “Tiger King,” which seems like one of the defining hits of the pandemic, came in at number four, with 15.7 billion minutes streamed — though Nielsen’s methodology puts it at a disadvantage, since it only has eight episodes. The same could probably be said for “The Mandalorian,” the first non-Netflix series on the list, with 14.5 billion minutes streamed.Image Credits: NielsenThe numbers were even bigger for acquired series — all of them streaming on Netflix last year, although the number one show, “The Office” (57.1 billion minutes streamed) just moved to Peacock. The other shows in the top five are “Grey’s Anatomy” (39.4 billon minutes), “Criminal Minds” (35.4 billion minutes), “NCIS” (28.1 billion minutes) and “Schitt’s Creek” (23.8 billion minutes).On the movie side, the biggest title was “Frozen II,” which came early to Disney+ and was streamed for 14.9 billion minutes, followed by “Moana” (Disney+, 10.5 billion minutes), “The Secret Life of Pets 2” (Netflix, 9.1 billion minutes), “Onward” (Disney+, 8.4 billion minutes) and “Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch” (Netflix, 6.2 billion minutes). This seems to be a category where family films have advantage, perhaps because kids are more likely to watch them multiple times.Beyond releasing these lists, Nielsen is announcing a new product designed to measure viewership of theatrical video on-demand, aka movies that are released for rent or purchase online. While studios should already have access to basic purchase data for these titles, Nielsen says it can provide “the entire media food chain” with more detailed information about things like the age, gender, ethnicity and geographic territory of who’s watching.In a statement, Nielsen’s general manager of audience measurement Scott N. Brown said:As this unprecedented pandemic continues to influence consumer behavior, perhaps even through a prolonged state of recovery waves, being able to measure and help clients appropriately monetize new revenue streams has never been more crucial. A bigger question might be what will audiences do following any recovery, how the behavior adopted during stay-at-home orders might influence habits when consumers have the ability to go back to theaters to enjoy that experience and how content creators will leverage data to make the best decisions regarding distribution platforms in the future.Nielsen plans to combine traditional and digital TV ratings\xa0']",An even bigger battle for gig worker rights is on the horizon,"['The Office’', 'The Office’', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Netflix', 'Netflix', 'Ozark', 'Lucifer', 'Tiger King', 'Nielsen’s', 'Peacock', 'Frozen II', 'Moana', 'Netflix', 'Netflix', 'Nielsen’s', 'Scott N.

The startup claims its tech can boost performance, promote better scalability, cut down on hosting costs and offer developers a more streamlined experience.Nacelle has closed an $18 million Series A led by Inovia with participation from Accomplice, Index Ventures, High Alpha, Silas Capital and Lerer Hippeau. The company just closed a $4.8 million seed round in mid-2020, the speedy pace of their Series A’s close seems to speak to the investor enthusiasm that has deepened around companies operating in the e-commerce world.Nacelle raises $4.8M for its headless e-commerce platform“It’s no secret that commerce has done well during COVID,” CEO Brian Anderson tells TechCrunch. “Not only did we get this subtle structural change with COVID that I believe is long-lasting, but merchants have been focusing more on performance.”One of the startup’s central points of focus has been ensuring that they can bring customers onboard its platform without causing undue headaches. It can be “very painful to migrate data” with other services, Anderson says. The company’s service is “anti-rip-and-replace,” meaning potential customers can integrate “without having to be rebuild their stores.”The firm’s customer base is largely made up of small- to medium-sized e-commerce sites.

While financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, Weber has confirmed that June will continue to operate as its own brand wholly owned by Weber-Stephen Products and will continue to both sell and develop the June Oven and related products. Meanwhile, June co-founder Nikhil Bhogal will take on a role as SVP of Technology and Connected Devices across the Weber lineup.Weber had already teamed up with June, with the startup providing the technology and expertise behind its Weber Connect smart grilling platform. That includes both the Weber Connect Smart Grilling Hub, which adds connected smart grill features to any grill, and the built-in smart cooking features on its SmokeFire line of wood pellet grills. That partnership began with a cold email Van Horn received in 2018 from then-Weber CEO and current Executive Chairman Jim Stephen, the son of the company’s original founder.“He said he was a fan, he was a customer, and he couldn’t imagine a future without June technology powering every product in the Weber collection,” Van Horn told me in an interview. “I said, ‘Slow down — what are you talking about? Yeah, who are you?’ And he said ‘I’m flying out, I’ll be there Monday.’ ” I normally have my nice demo setup that I do, I’ll do like chocolate lava cake and a steak [in the June Oven]. So I got there about 15 minutes early to do that, and [Jim] was already sitting in the front steps of the office, ready to open the door for me — he’s like, ‘I don’t need a demo, I own this.’ ”“His energy and ability to see things often before other people, it blew my mind,” Van Horn continued. “Soon after I met Chris [Scherzinger, Weber’s current chief executive], who was joining as CEO and [I] was able to experience firsthand this, honestly very surprising and wonderful culture of this historic Weber brand.”As mentioned, June became a partner to Weber and powered the connected cooking platform it debuted at CES last year. Weber also led June’s Series C funding round, a previously undisclosed final round of financing that Weber led in 2018 prior to this exit.June’s third-gen smart oven goes up for pre-order, starting at $599Van Horn will act as president of June under the terms of the new arrangement and will continue to lead development of its current and future products. He said that Weber’s ability to help them with international scale and distribution via their existing global footprint was a big motivating factor in why June chose to join the now 63-year-old company. But another key ingredient was just how much Weber proved to be a place where the company’s culture was still centered on customer focus and a love of food.“Obviously why Nikhil and I started June was that we love food, and we love cooking,” Van Horn said. “And a lot of the principles of how we think about how products get made are a lot of Apple’s principles — a large percentage of the June team comes from Apple. We’ve obviously kind of brought that to a microscale with our small 60-person startup. But being able to work with this very eager Weber team, that’s just been really exciting from the start and has been pretty incredible.”As for Weber, the company gains a software and technology team that was born out of the idea of approaching cooking from a tech-first perspective — and they intend to infuse that expertise throughout their product lineup, with an eye toward building on their legacy of quality and customer enthusiasm.“Once you infuse the software engineering, the connected product design and the machine-intelligence expertise that you have, you get these core competencies or capabilities, but that really undersells it,” Scherzinger told me. “Matt put together a team of superstars, and we just got a first-round draft pick [in June] that takes the Weber game to another level. That allows us to accelerate a significant number of initiatives, and you can expect to see an expansion of what Weber Connect can become in terms of new experiences for consumers, new services and new products, for sure, starting as early as 2021 and 2022.”While Weber and June are not sharing specifics around the deal, as mentioned, Scherzinger did mention that “Matt and his team and his investors all did handsomely.” June’s prior investors include Amazon Alexa Fund, Lerer Hippeau, First Round Capital, Promus Ventures, Industry Ventures, Eclipse Ventures and more.Asmoke’s portable pellet grill is super affordable and great for small spaces']",Eden,"['NavigationClose', 'WeberOutdoor', 'Matt Van Horn', 'Weber-Stephen Products', 'Nikhil', 'SVP of Technology', 'Connected Devices', 'Weber Connect', 'SmokeFire', 'Van Horn', 'Executive', 'Jim Stephen', 'Van Horn', 'Chris', 'CES', 'Nikhil', 'Van Horn', 'Apple’s', 'Apple', 'Matt', 'Scherzinger', 'Matt', 'Amazon Alexa Fund', 'Lerer Hippeau', 'First Round Capital', 'Promus Ventures', 'Industry Ventures', 'Eclipse Ventures', 'Asmoke', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Alexa', 'VenturesFirst Round CapitalfoodgrillinghobbiesIndustry Ventureslerer', 'Matt Van Horn', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

While it had seemed to start last year in a bit of a correction, demand for it during the pandemic (and its widespread designation as an essential business), created a breakthrough for the industry. We saw early signs of that in our cannabis investor survey back in May of 2020.Today, TechCrunch has surveyed five key investors who touch different aspects of the cannabis business, based on our TechCrunch List of top investors who founders recommend to us, and other sources. We asked these investors the same six questions, and each provided similar thoughts, but different approaches. Despite remaining headwinds, the future is looking up for most cannabis businesses, according to these investors.Morgan Paxhia, managing director of Poseidon Investment Management, put it this way: “2021 could be nothing short of amazing for our industry. We expect capital flows to pick up massively from pent-up demand, good public markets bringing more IPOs, lots of M&A and new innovative startups coming on scene. We see opportunity with social equity for the first time, driven by private markets rather than poorly constructed regulations. It’s going to be fun!”Morgan Paxhia, managing director, Poseidon Investment ManagementEmily Paxhia, managing partner, Poseidon Investment ManagementAnthony Coniglio, CEO,\xa0NewLake CapitalMatt Shalhoub, managing partner, Green Acre CapitalJerel Registre, managing director, Curio WMBE FundMorgan Paxhia, managing director, Poseidon Investment Management2020 was a blockbuster year for cannabis. What advice are you giving your portfolio companies entering 2021?Typical mantra for us, stay focused. Markets, deals and valuations are volatile in our industry but we all have to do our best to tune out the noise and focus. I’d say a great example of a team with focus is GTI. They have executed against a strategy while many of their supposed peers have done very irrational deals, impaired shareholder value, etc. GTI continues to march down its path and their results are showing.How is COVID-19 changing the cannabis landscape?2020 was an inward-facing year as most companies could not travel, capital was tight and macro was uncertain. This inward work has led to a lot of fundamental improvements for operators. There are others that got one last puff of wind but their businesses are too impaired and will continue to fall to the wayside.2021 could be nothing short of amazing for our industry. We expect capital flows to pick up massively from pent-up demand, good public markets bringing more IPOs, lots of M&A and new innovative startups coming on scene. We see opportunity with social equity for the first time, driven by private markets rather than poorly constructed regulations. It’s going to be fun!From retail to SaaS to research, there’s a lot of inroads to investing in cannabis. What sector of the business do you see has the best opportunity for growth in 2021?We are bullish on select state markets. For example, new adult-use markets in NJ and AZ and existing markets with new growth prospects opening in CA and NY.SaaS could get very interesting as there are several players reaching scale that are garnering mainstream attention.\nInternational opportunity is mostly Mexico. It is the largest federally legal market that will just be opening in 2021. Many have not taken this one seriously but we have and are very proud of the efforts that went to moving such a monumental step forward.The history of drug enforcement in the United States has been deeply unjust and racist; as we enter a period of growing legalization, are there things that startups and investors can do to address that inequity?The industry, meaning established companies, entrepreneurs and investors need to drive solutions here. Regulations have been terrible and only exacerbate the issue. We have been putting a lot of thought into this area for years, watching various aspects such as the missteps taken by government and the unfortunate poor intentions from supposed investors.We see a path emerging here that is collaborative, simple and should be attractive to capital providers. Stay tuned.Who are some leaders in the cannabis space — companies, founders, growers?My sister Emily is a co-founder and rock star! She is a true leader in this space on so many levels.Ahmer Iqbal, CEO of Sublime — Ahmer took the role at a very challenging time and with very little capital was able to rebuild the company into a leader in the CA market.Jason Wild — Not only is he a savvy investor, he puts his money where his mouth is. Outside of Poseidon, I do not know any other person in this industry that puts up so much of their own money into what they believe in.Coleman Beale, CEO of Bastcore — If you are not familiar with the industrial hemp renaissance in the U.S., look no further.

The goal of the suit is to overturn Prop 22, which classifies gig workers as independent contractors in California.The suit, filed in California’s Supreme Court, argues Prop 22 makes it harder for the state’s legislature to create and enforce a workers’ compensation system for gig workers. It also argues Prop 22 violates the rule that limits ballot measures to a single issue, as well as unconstitutionally defines what would count as an amendment to the measure. As it stands today, Prop 22 requires a seven-eights legislative supermajority in order to amend the measure.“Every day, rideshare drivers like me struggle to make ends meet because companies like Uber and Lyft prioritize corporate profits over our well-being,” Saori Okawa, a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. “With Prop 22, they’re not just ignoring our health and safety — they’re discarding our state’s constitution. I’m joining this lawsuit because I know it’s up to the people we elect to make our laws, not wealthy executives who profit from our labor. I’m confident the court will see Prop 22 for the corporate power grab that it is, and that Prop 22 will live in infamy along with unconstitutional ballot measures like Prop 8 and Prop 187.”This suit is the latest in a long battle between gig workers and tech companies. Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft have their eyes on pursuing Prop 22-like legislation elsewhere. Given Uber and Lyft’s anti-gig-workers-as-employees stance, it came as no surprise when Uber and Lyft separately said they would pursue similar legislation in other parts of the country and the world.Uber, Lyft and DoorDash were not immediately available for comment. But the group behind Yes on 22, Protect App Based Jobs & Services, provided a statement to TechCrunch:“Nearly 10 million California voters — including the vast majority of app-based drivers — passed Prop 22 to protect driver independence, while providing historic new protections,” Jim Pyatt, an Uber driver who supported Prop 22, said in a statement. “Voters across the political spectrum spoke loud and clear, passing Prop 22 in a landslide. Meritless lawsuits that seek to undermine the clear democratic will of the people do not stand up to scrutiny in the courts.”An even bigger battle for gig worker rights is on the horizon']",Vantage,"['SEIU', 'NavigationClose', 'SEIU', 'Rose Dickey@meganrosedickey / 8:05 PM GMT+1•January 12', 'AFP', 'Getty Images / Getty', 'the Service Employees International Union', 'Uber', 'Saori Okawa', 'Uber', 'Uber', 'Lyft', 'DoorDash', 'Protect App Based Jobs & Services', 'Jim Pyatt', 'Uber', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'SEIU', 'Rose Dickey8:05 PM', 'the Service Employees International Union', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/jqjedkCIX4,2021-01-12T19:13:21,Gett raises $115M for its on-demand ride-hailing platform for business users,"['As ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft continue to find their feet in a new landscape for transportation services — where unessential travel is being actively discouraged in many markets and people remain concerned about catching the coronavirus in restricted, shared spaces — a smaller player that has carved out a place for itself targeting business users is announcing more funding.Gett, which started out as a more direct competitor to the likes of Uber and Lyft but now focuses mainly on ground transportation services for business clients in major cities around the world, said in a short statement that it has closed a round of $115 million. The company — co-headquartered in London and Israel — also said it is now “operationally profitable” and is hitting its budget targets.The funding is being led by new backer Pelham Capital Investments Ltd. and also included participation from unnamed existing investors.Including this round, Gett has now raised $865 million, with past investors including VW, Access and its founder Len Blavatnik,\xa0Kreos, MCI and more. Gett’s last confirmed valuation was $1.5 billion, pegged to a $200 million fundraise in May 2019. It’s not talking about current valuation, or any recent customer numbers, today.Dave Waiser, Gett’s founder and CEO, described the funding earlier today in a note to me as an extension to the company’s previous round, a $100 million equity investment that it announced in July last year.Chairman Amos Genish, said in a statement that the funding round was oversubscribed, “which shows the market’s interest in our platform and long-term vision. Gett is disrupting and transforming a fragmented market delivering ever-critical cost optimisation and client satisfaction.”The company has been building out a focus on the B2B market for several years now — a smart way of avoiding the expensive and painful race to compete like-for-like against the Ubers of the world — and this most recent round is focused on doubling down on that.The Gett of the past — it was originally founded in 2010 under the name GetTaxi — did indeed try to build a business around both consumers and higher-end users, but the idea behind Gett today is to focus on corporate accounts.Gett provides those businesses’ employees with a predictable and reliable app-based platform to make it easier to order car services wherever they happen to be traveling, and those businesses — which in the past would have used a fragmented mix of local services — then have a consolidated way of managing, accounting for and analysing those travel expenses. It claims to be able to save companies some 25%-40% in costs.The company previously said that its network covered some 1,500 cities. In certain metropolitan areas like London and Moscow, Gett provides transportation services directly. In markets where it does not have direct operations (such as anywhere in the U.S., including New York), it partners with third parties, such as Lyft.“We are on a journey to transform corporate ground travel and I’m delighted that investors find our model attractive,” Waiser said in a statement today. “This investment will allow us to further develop our SaaS technology and deepen our proposition within the corporate ground travel market.”Juno shuts down its operations in NYC as owner Gett signs strategic partnership with LyftUpdated to correct that this is an extension of the $100 million round.

Henceforth, the startup will be called Eden Workplace.“We had a lot of clients in different categories like retail, some industrial and some classic real estate and we wanted to reaffirm that we’re really building software and a service marketplace for the modern office,” said cofounder and CEO Joe Du Bey. “We also felt that the company is fundamentally different because of all the SaaS tools that we’re building, so it acknowledges that there’s a change in our business.”Eden also acquired the rights to edenworkplace.com, which Du Bey believes will lend more credibility to the brand who is looking to sell into corporations and organizations and IT departments.Image Credits: EdenThis isn’t the first evolution for the office management startup.Eden started out as a service to help folks troubleshoot tech issues using on-demand specialists. Over time, the company moved into office management services, such as cleanings, repairs, re-stocking, IT help and more. The vertically integrated startup turned into a marketplace, working with multiple vendors to provide services to clients.In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Eden has had to shift yet again, introducing SaaS products to help people return to and work in their office spaces. That includes the ability to offer COVID-safety questionnaires, track the people coming in and out of the office, alongside tools for visitor management and room booking.Eden intros SaaS tools in a bid to become a more comprehensive office management platformEden is also introducing a desk reservation system for workers to ensure they can maintain social distancing. This feature was teased at the time of the SaaS launch but is available now to new and existing customers.Thus far, Eden’s SaaS tools have been growing revenue by more than 100 percent month over month, and Du Bey believes the SaaS side of the business will grow 5x by the end of 2021.']",SaaS securitization,"['Eden Workplace', 'NavigationClose', 'ScreenEden', 'Eden WorkplaceJordan', 'Eden Workplace', 'Joe Du', 'edenworkplace.com', 'Du Bey', 'Eden', 'SaaS', 'Eden’s', 'Du Bey', 'SaaS', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Eden WorkplaceJordan Crook7:00', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/0KAuIUI8FF,2021-01-12T18:16:44,Descript raises $30M to build the next generation of video and audio editing tools,"['The popularity of podcasting and online video shows no signs of slowing down, and so we continue to see a wave of creators publishing a profusion of audio and video content to fill out the airwaves. Today, a company building a platform to make that work easier and more interesting to execute is announcing a round of growth funding to double down on the opportunity.Descript, which builds tools that let creators edit audio and video files by using, for example, natural language processing to link the content to the editing of text files, has picked up $30 million in a Series B round of funding.Andrew Mason, the CEO and founder of the company, said in an interview that the plan will be to use the money to continue building out tools not just for mass-market and individual professional and amateur creators, but also, increasingly, organizations that might be using the tools for their own in-house video and audio needs, a use case that has definitely grown during the last year of global remote working.“We see ourselves… as an all encompassing platform for all media needs,” Mason said.The company had early wins by signing on customers like NPR, Pushkin Industries, VICE, The Washington Post and The New York Times, as well as smaller and more modest media outfits.Mason said that it’s also now seeing startups and bigger businesses using video for communication also adopting Descript tools, especially in cases where it makes more sense to visualize the answers, but the content could still use the ability to be edited.“Whether it’s externally or internally, for things like bug reporting or personalized introductions or helpdesk videos, we’re seeing people using Descript for company video,” he added, “sometimes in place of something like an email.”Spark Capital, and specifically Nabeel Hyatt (who in a past life co-founded a music games specialist, Conduit Labs, acquired by Zynga), led the round, with Andreessen Horowitz and Redpoint Ventures also participating (both backed Descript in its $15 million Series A in 2019).A number of individuals — some investors, and some investors also famous for their own video, podcasting and publishing work — also participated this Series B, among them Devdatta Akhawe, Alex Blumberg, Jack Conte, Justine Ezarik, Todd Goldberg, Jean-Denis Greze, John Lilly, Tobi Lutke, Bharat Mediratta, Shishir Mehrotra, Casey Neistat, Brian Pokorny, Raghavendra Prabhu, Lenny Rachitsky, Naval Ravikant, Jay Simons, Jake Shapiro, Rahul Vohra, and Ev Williams.The news comes on the heels of an eventful several months for the company. In October, Descript released its first major update to its editing suite by expanding from audio editing tools to cover video as well.In an interview last week, Mason said that the feedback so far has been “excellent” for the technology, although he is declined to say how many users or usage Descript has had for this or its older audio technology.Descript’s move expanding into the newer medium, in any case, makes a lot of sense, when you consider how closely aligned a lot of audio-based podcasting content has been with corresponding videos — with many of the most popular podcasters often posting videos of their recordings on YouTube and other platforms, for those who prefer to watch as well as listen to recordings. It helps, too, that video is highly monetizable. Podcasting is on track to make more than $1 billion in ad revenues in the U.S. in 2021, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. Meanwhile, even in a year that was considered a downturn, digital video pulled in more than $22 billion.That double-platform approach, however, has largely been executed on auto pilot up to now, as Mason points out, describing a lot of the video as “window dressing.”“We watch a lot of video and podcasts and think about how we can create a tool that makes it fun and easy to craft great content,” Mason said. “One thing we’ve observed is that a remarkable amount of video is just audio with window dressing. You don’t notice it until you start looking through that lens. A ton of video is about what is happening with the audio, and so a lot of that video is just filler.”A lot of the editing is no more than a series of jump cuts, he said, and notwithstanding other challenges like bad equipment, it’s just not a very exciting experience.That lays the groundwork for Descript not just to create tools to make it easier to edit but in the future to conceive of how to do so in a way that creates a better and potentially more original product at the end of the process, too.Mason’s turn to audio-based services for his two past startups — prior to Descript, he founded and eventually sold (to Bose) an audio-based city guide service called Detour — has been something of a left turn for a man probably still better known as the quirky co-founder of the once wildly popular sales platform Groupon.However, Mason studied music at university, and if you talk to him, it is more than obvious that audio and sound-based experiences — not just music but the impact that aural experiences can have — are really where his passion lies.Mason is long gone from Groupon, but he remains a bit of a wag. He is quick to quip that his ability to raise money for completely different concepts that are a world away from e-commerce are in no smart part due to his having already won the “startup lottery”.And yes, like many jokes, it’s a telling and often true term, in my experience and observation. But in this case, I’d say it undersells some of the really interesting innovations that Descript has built and is building using innovations in AI to think about how to address some of the challenges that have emerged out of media production — at once so easy to do (so many creator platforms today) yet hard to get right.More generally, audio technology is not only proving to be in demand with customers, but (as it happens) it is also being sought out larger tech companies, including (most recently) Amazon, Spotify, Apple, Google and Facebook, which are picking up a lot of smaller audio startups in their own efforts to build out their bigger media business.And this is at the heart of why Descript has attracted this latest round of investment.“We’ve been convinced of machine learning’s power to be used as a creative tool for some time,” Hyatt at Spark noted to me. “Descript is perhaps the best example of that in a startup today. The company takes some very complicated technology, but presents it in a way that’s actually easier to use than the status quo products.\xa0It’s very rare that you come across a company that uses technology to both empower a creative professional to work ten times faster, and simultaneously makes the creative process ten times easier for an amateur, growing the addressable market. Anyone editing audio or video, which is most of us nowadays, can see the benefits.”']",,"['NavigationClose ScreenDescript', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'CommentThe', 'Andrew Mason', 'Mason', 'NPR', 'Pushkin Industries', 'The Washington Post', 'The New York Times', 'Mason', 'Nabeel Hyatt', 'Conduit Labs', 'Andreessen Horowitz', 'Redpoint Ventures', 'Descript', 'Devdatta Akhawe', 'Alex Blumberg', 'Jack Conte', 'Justine Ezarik', 'Todd Goldberg', 'Jean-Denis Greze', 'John Lilly', 'Tobi Lutke', 'Bharat Mediratta', 'Shishir Mehrotra', 'Casey Neistat', 'Brian Pokorny', 'Raghavendra Prabhu', 'Lenny Rachitsky', 'Jay Simons', 'Jake Shapiro', 'Rahul Vohra', 'Ev Williams', 'Descript', 'Mason', 'Descript', 'Descript’s', 'YouTube', 'the Interactive Advertising Bureau', 'Mason', 'Mason', 'Mason’s', 'Detour', 'Groupon', 'Mason', 'Mason', 'Descript', 'AI', 'Amazon', 'Spotify', 'Apple', 'Descript', 'Hyatt', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'IntelligenceMediaandrew', 'Lunden7:16', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/VGm3Pidu2B,2021-01-12T18:00:39,Vantage makes managing AWS easier,"['Vantage, a new service that makes managing AWS resources and their associated spend easier, is coming out of stealth today. The service offers its users an alternative to the complex AWS console with support for most of the standard AWS services, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs, ECS and Fargate and Route 53 hosted zones.The company’s founder, Ben Schaechter, previously worked at AWS and Digital Ocean (and before that, he worked on Crunchbase, too). Yet while DigitalOcean showed him how to build a developer experience for individuals and small businesses, he argues that the underlying services and hardware simply weren’t as robust as those of the hyperclouds. AWS, on the other hand, offers everything a developer could want (and likely more), but the user experience leaves a lot to be desired.Image Credits: Vantage“The idea was really born out of ‘what if we could take the user experience of DigitalOcean and apply it to the three public cloud providers, AWS, GCP and Azure,” Schaechter told me. “We decided to start just with AWS because the experience there is the roughest and it’s the largest player in the market. And I really think that we can provide a lot of value there before we do GCP and Azure.”The focus for Vantage is on the developer experience and cost transparency. Schaechter noted that some of its users describe it as being akin to a “Mint for AWS.” To get started, you give Vantage a set of read permissions to your AWS services and the tool will automatically profile everything in your account. The service refreshes this list once per hour, but users can also refresh their lists manually.Given that it’s often hard enough to know which AWS services you are actually using, that alone is a useful feature. “That’s the number one use case,” he said. “What are we paying for and what do we have?”At the core of Vantage is what the team calls “views,” which allows you to see which resources you are using. What is interesting here is that this is quite a flexible system and allows you to build custom views to see which resources you are using for a given application across regions, for example.

Henceforth, the startup will be called Eden Workplace.“We had a lot of clients in different categories like retail, some industrial and some classic real estate and we wanted to reaffirm that we’re really building software and a service marketplace for the modern office,” said cofounder and CEO Joe Du Bey. “We also felt that the company is fundamentally different because of all the SaaS tools that we’re building, so it acknowledges that there’s a change in our business.”Eden also acquired the rights to edenworkplace.com, which Du Bey believes will lend more credibility to the brand who is looking to sell into corporations and organizations and IT departments.Image Credits: EdenThis isn’t the first evolution for the office management startup.Eden started out as a service to help folks troubleshoot tech issues using on-demand specialists. Over time, the company moved into office management services, such as cleanings, repairs, re-stocking, IT help and more. The vertically integrated startup turned into a marketplace, working with multiple vendors to provide services to clients.In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Eden has had to shift yet again, introducing SaaS products to help people return to and work in their office spaces. That includes the ability to offer COVID-safety questionnaires, track the people coming in and out of the office, alongside tools for visitor management and room booking.Eden intros SaaS tools in a bid to become a more comprehensive office management platformEden is also introducing a desk reservation system for workers to ensure they can maintain social distancing. This feature was teased at the time of the SaaS launch but is available now to new and existing customers.Thus far, Eden’s SaaS tools have been growing revenue by more than 100 percent month over month, and Du Bey believes the SaaS side of the business will grow 5x by the end of 2021.']",Grafana Labs,"['Eden Workplace', 'NavigationClose', 'ScreenEden', 'Eden WorkplaceJordan', 'Eden Workplace', 'Joe Du', 'edenworkplace.com', 'Du Bey', 'Eden', 'SaaS', 'Eden’s', 'Du Bey', 'SaaS', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Eden WorkplaceJordan Crook7:00', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Financial entrepreneurs have launched a number of products, from SaaS securitization to debt-based financing, to help founders avoid that dilution, particularly when they have recurring revenues clocked on the books.SaaS securitization will disrupt VC’s biggest returns this coming decadeCapchase is one of this new crop of startup-focused fintech companies. It allows startups to receive their future recurring revenue today in the form of debt, allowing founders to spend future money earlier and potentially avoid at least some of those expensive, dilutive rounds of venture capital, particularly when they are just getting started. I profiled the Boston-based company a few months ago, when they had raised a $4.6 million seed led by Caffeinated Capital.Capchase raises $4.6M to deliver fast cash to SaaS companiesNow, the company is swimming in new funds, and it’s ready to start lending out to even more startups. This morning, the company announced that it has raised $60 million in an “asset-backed credit facility” from i80 Group. That should allow Capchase to expand the number of startups it works with, as well as the amount of revenue prepayment it could potentially extend to each startup as well.i80 itself has built an investment firm based around credit underwriting just these sorts of projects for startups. In addition to this facility for Capchase and similar fintech underwriting, the group also backs real estate underwriting projects like for Properly, where it co-led a $100 million facility with Silicon Valley Bank.Capchase, which was founded in early 2020, claims that its initial customers have delayed fundraises by an average of 8 months and saved about 16% in overall dilution. Of course, those number will vary widely depending on the startup, its growth, its recurring revenues and other variables.Capchase’s goal isn’t just to extend revenue prepayment to startups, but to do it fast, sometimes in just days or even hours depending on the complexity of the recurring revenues of its clients.

Last week it was the screen-swiveling all-in-one and some AR glasses, and today (the first official day of the show), the company’s got an interesting update to last year’s dual-display ThinkBook Plus.Like the original, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 2 i sports an e-ink display on the lid. Lenovo’s been experimenting with the technology for a number of form factors, and this one makes more sense than previous shots — essentially offering up a quick-glance notification center. I suppose you could also use it as an e-reader if you’re so inclined.Ultimately, like a lot of what Lenovo does, it’s perhaps more interesting than honestly useful. Though, as ever, points for trying something new. This time out the screen is significantly larger, at about the same size as the primary screen. It now measures 12 inches and sports a 2560 x 1600 resolution (also matching the main screen). The refresh rate has been enhanced, and now it’s possible to run some of the apps on the lid without opening it.Lenovo launches AR glasses for enterpriseThe laptop also sports a built-in stylus for use with the touchscreen. Also interesting is the arrival of the new ThinkBook Charging Mat, which uses Energysquare’s Power by Contact to power the battery.

I suspect charging it up using just the pad is a fairly time-consuming process.Dell notably introduced its own take on the category back at CES 2017.

In addition, Grafana’s paid Pro plan for its hosted service is also getting an update and will now include access to five times more metrics per month.With the free plan, users get a 14-day retention period for metrics and logs, access for up to three team members, 50 GB of log storage and up to 10,000 series for Prometheus and Graphite metrics.

https://t.co/yyKHlyGs1K,2021-01-12T16:54:10,Study finds around one-third of Americans regularly get their news from Facebook,"['Around a third of Americans regularly get their news from Facebook, according to the latest study from Pew Research Center, whose surveys aim to better understand the current media landscape in the U.S. In the updated report, Pew Research found that around half of U.S. adults, or 53%, said they “often” or “sometimes” use social media to get their news. This is spread out across a number of sites, but Facebook is at the top of the list.The study found that 36% of U.S. adults said they “regularly” access Facebook to get news. This is a significantly larger percentage than almost any other social media platform, with the exception of YouTube, which is used regularly for news by 23% of U.S. adults.Beyond that, the percentages are much smaller. Even Trump’s preferred platform for communication (well, until recently), Twitter, is only used regularly for news by 15% of U.S. adults, Pew found.Why Twitter says it banned President TrumpOnly around one in 10 Americans or fewer said they regularly got their news from other social media platforms, including Instagram (11%), Reddit (6%), Snapchat (4%), LinkedIn (4%), TikTok (3%), WhatsApp (3%), Tumblr (1%) and Twitch (1%).Pew notes that the lower percentages for using these sites as a source of news also has to do with the fact that fewer Americans report using these sites at all.But even if their audiences are smaller, the site’s users may be heavily engaged with the news. Twitter, for instance, is used only by 25% of U.S. adults, but over half the users (59%) say they get news on the platform, compared with 54% of Facebook users. Meanwhile, 42% of Reddit users get news regularly on its site, even though it has a significantly smaller user base than Facebook.In other words, the list of “top news platforms” looks a bit different when you count how many of a social media site’s own users gets the news regularly from the platform, instead of just how many U.S. adults altogether get their news from the site.When measured this way, Twitter, Facebook and Reddit lead, followed by YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, then Twitch.Pew additionally examined the demographic makeup of those who use social media for news, and found that white adults make up the majority of the regular news users for sites like Facebook and Reddit. Both Black and Hispanic adults, meanwhile, made up around a quarter of Instagram’s regular users (22% and 27%, respectively.) Facebook was found to also skew toward women (63% versus 35%) when it came to regularly using it getting the news, while Reddit skews toward men (67% versus 29%).What’s also interesting about the report’s findings is that, despite Americans’ widespread usage of social media for getting the news, a majority (59%) said they believed it to be “largely inaccurate.” This figure has stayed fairly consistent over the past couple of years, as well. It’s up from 57% in 2018 and the same as on 2019.Nearly half of social media users also said reading the news on social media has not made much of a difference in helping them to understand current events.This finding seems to contradict reports and studies that say social media sites — and their algorithms that personalize news to the interests and beliefs of their users — have helped radicalize people online. Last week, the results of that was on full display as a mob of people who have consumed misinformation and conspiracy theories, often for years, stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.However, keep in mind that Pew’s study is based on self-reported data. So while respondents may have claimed social media posts didn’t really help them “understand” the news, they may be underestimating those posts’ power and influence over time.The Pew Research Center regularly runs studies like this. For example, last year it reported how social media news consumers tend to be less engaged and less knowledgeable about the facts on key news topics, like the U.S. election or COVID-19. The same study also found that the social media news consumers were more frequently exposed to fringe conspiracies.The platforms themselves have done little to help prevent the spread of misinformation, beyond adding basic fact-checks. Facebook waited years to ban QAnon groups, but many still remained after the sweep, as did “Stop the Steal” conspiracy groups, after a similar crackdown on the hashtags and other incitements of violence.The latest report is here.Facebook blocks hashtags for #sharpiegate, #stopthesteal election conspiracies']",world’s most valuable edtech startup,"['FacebookSarah', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Pew Research Center', 'Pew Research', 'YouTube', 'Trump’s', 'Twitter', 'Pew', 'Twitter', 'Instagram', 'Reddit', 'Snapchat', 'TikTok', 'WhatsApp', 'Tumblr', 'Twitch', 'Twitter', 'YouTube', 'Instagram', 'Snapchat', 'WhatsApp', 'Twitch', 'Black', 'Instagram’s', 'Pew’s', 'The Pew Research Center', 'COVID-19', 'QAnon', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'FacebookSarah Perez5:54', 'Pew Research Center', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

This is a mere concept, which means it’s unlikely to become a real product. However, these concepts can signal where a company is headed on the design or product front. And when it comes to electric and autonomous vehicles, GM has proven its willingness to invest in the technologies.“We are preparing for a world where advances in electric and autonomous technology make personal air travel possible,” Michael Simcoe, GM’s global design chief, said during the presentation. “It is a concept designed for the moment when time is of essence and convenience is everything.”Image Credits: GMThe eVTOL concept is equipped with a 90-kilowatt hour electric motor to power four rotors that can whisk the passenger off of a rooftop to their destination. It also comes with air-to-air and air-to-ground communications capabilities.Simcoe said the company has more concepts planned, including a “luxurious two-seater designed for you and someone very special to decompress, relax and enjoy a multi sensory experience choreographed for more intimate journeys.”The entire exercise, as Simcoe explained, is to show the world what autonomy and Cadillac luxury might look like in the “not too distant future.”\xa0Of course, these concepts are also designed to convey just how serious GM is about the future of transportation, which in its view centers around electrification, automated vehicle technology and connected car services.']",Roboflow,"['Cadillac', 'Cadillac', 'NavigationClose', 'Cadillac', 'Cadillac', 'Cadillac', 'GM', 'GM', 'Michael Simcoe', 'GM', 'Simcoe', 'Cadillac', 'GM', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAutomotiveTransportationCadillacCESCES', 'Cadillac', 'Cadillac', 'Korosec5:52 PM GMT+1•January 12', 'Cadillac', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/WuJY9ErjzF,2021-01-12T16:41:16,Rollables are the new foldables,"['Smartphone sales are bad — and have been for a couple of years now. Certainly this ongoing pandemic hasn’t helped. All the talk about how 5G and new form factors were going to cause a kind of bounce-back all fell by the wayside, as people put a pause on unnecessary luxuries.Samsung is the only company that’s seen some success with the foldable form factor, and that whole thing got off to a…rough start. There were plenty of technical issues at first, leading to a less than auspicious first impression. These days, price continues to be a major hurdle — especially during a time when paying $1,000 and up on a phone is a major red flag for many.In the world of phone form factors, two is, at the very least, the start of a trend. And on day one of CES both LG and TCL have offered their take on yet another form factor designed to offer more screen real estate in pocketable devices.Image Credits: TCLLG’s product is — for the moment — the more notable of the two, largely because the company plans to actually release the thing. In an interview published this morning, spokesperson Ken Hong told Nikkei, “As it is released at CES 2021, I can tell that it will be launched this year.”And, indeed, LG’s a company not afraid to take chances with a wacky form factor. There are a number of examples of the phenomenon in recent years, most notably the swiveling screen on the LG Wing.Still, the product didn’t amount to much more than a brief tease during a press conference (an excuse to transition between scenes, really), so you’d be forgiven for assuming that the tech still has a long way to go.TCL, meanwhile, noted up front that the product is still firmly in the concept phase, but managed to give us a better look. I suppose it’s easier to parade concept than an unfinished real-world product. Details are still slim, but the company says the device is capable of expanding from 6.7 to 7.8 inches.One imagines — or, at least, hopes — that the industry has learned from the issues stemming from the first batch of foldables. Sometimes the race to bring technology to market results in delivering something half-baked, an issue that came back to bite companies like Samsung and Motorola. Lab testing is one thing — the real world is a different thing entirely.']",HomeValet,"['NavigationClose', 'Samsung', 'LG', 'TCL', 'TCLLG’s', 'Ken Hong', 'LG’s', 'Samsung', 'Motorola', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/0OVHABVwtm,2021-01-12T16:13:32,"Facebook revamps ‘Access Your Information’ tool to better break down, explain data usage","['Facebook today is rolling out an update to its Access Your Information tool with the goal of making the tool easier to both use and navigate, as well as better explain how and why that data is used. The new version of the tool has been visually redesigned, and now further breaks down the viewable information across eight categories instead of just two.The tool first launched in 2018 in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, when the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users had been hijacked. Following that event, Facebook made a number of changes to how its platform apps worked and rolled out new features to make it easier for users to find and utilize Facebook’s privacy settings.One of the additions was this Access Your Information tool, which offers users a secure way to manage their Facebook posts, reactions, comments and other things they’ve searched for. The idea is that you could use the tool to pull up your information, then “delete anything from your timeline or profile that you no longer want on Facebook.”Facebook redesigns Pages with a more simplified layout and no ‘Like’ buttonBefore, this tool offered just two broad categories of data: Your Information and Information About You. The updated version, on the other hand, has broken this out to eight categories:Your Activity Across FacebookFriends and FollowersPreferencesPersonal InformationLogged InformationAds InformationApps and Websites Off Of FacebookSecurity and Login InformationWithin each of these eight categories, the information is then further broken down into subcategories. This makes it easier to more narrowly drill down to just the sort of data you want to view and, possibly, remove.Image Credits: FacebookIn addition, the tool is introducing Search functionality with the update. You can find data categories by searching them — like by typing in “location” to pull up information about your location history.The tool will also now better explain how this data Facebook has can be used to personalize your experience on its platform. For example, you might see your primary location is one of the signals that was used to target you with an ad for a food delivery app. (Facebook already explains this in its Why Am I Seeing This tool for ads, but now it’s in this tool, too.)Facebook says the changes were developed based on how people had been using the tool — especially in terms of what categories of data they were clicking on.That said, the timing of the tool’s revamp is notable. There’s a large effort at Apple underway to better highlight to App Store users which apps collect personal data, which is then used to track them. Apple is now requiring apps to add App Store privacy labels and will soon require apps to get user consent on tracking.Facebook, in response to this push, launched a website and ran full-page ads in newspapers to gain support for its personalized advertising business, noting the harms it says will come to small businesses as a result of Apple’s changes.This revamped tool will help make Facebook’s case to users, as well, by explaining why the data and the ads could be useful. (After all, isn’t it better to see a food delivery ad for a company that actually serves your local area? Facebook would want you to think so.)Then there is the not-so-small-matter of people who may be trying to rapidly delete their incriminating Facebook history — like photos and videos of themselves inside the Capitol during last week’s riot, perhaps.

https://t.co/NjNbW5cwPk,2021-01-12T16:05:26,Byju’s is reportedly buying Indian brick-and-mortar institute Aakash for $1 billion,"['We may finally have an answer to why Byju’s, the world’s most valuable edtech startup, raised hundreds of millions of dollars last year.Bloomberg reports that the Bangalore-based startup has agreed to buy Aakash Educational Services, which owns and operates more than 200 physical tutoring centres across the country aimed at students preparing to qualify for top engineering and medical colleges.According to the publication, Byju’s will pay $1 billion to buy Aakash Educational Services, which was founded in 1988 and serves more than 250,000 students. Aakash sold 37.5% stake to Blackstone in late 2019 in a deal that valued the Indian firm at about $500 million.Indian decacorn Byju’s CEO talks about future acquisitions, coronavirus and international expansionA Byju’s spokesperson declined to comment.Byju’s has raised over $800 million in the past two years, and more than doubled its valuation to over $11 billion. The startup, like several other edtech firms in India, attracted tens of millions of students to its platform last year after the pandemic prompted New Delhi to shut down schools nationwide.Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake. The startup, which turned profitable in late 2019, served over 70 million students as of late last year.In an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last year, Byju’s co-founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran said the startup, which acquired a coding platform aimed at young students called WhiteHat Jr for $300 million last year, was open to more merger and acquisition opportunities.India’s Byju’s acquires WhiteHat Jr. for $300 millionThe startup is backed by several high-profile investors, including Bond, which was co-founded by Mary Meeker. Bond expects Byju’s to be worth over $30 billion within three years, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch earlier.Updated at 5.48PM IST, Wednesday: An Aakash spokesperson issued the following statement. “Aakash Educational Services Limited (AESL) is in talks with Byju’s for building a strong partnership. The Chaudhry family and Founders, Mr JC Chaudhry & Mr Aakash Chaudhry remain committed and will continue to run Aakash Educational Services along with its management team with the same passion and commitment.

https://t.co/cwPLz2UOpH,2021-01-12T16:00:42,Roboflow raises $2.1M for its end-to-end computer vision platform,"['Roboflow, a startup that aims to simplify the process of building computer vision models, today announced that it has raised a $2.1 million seed round co-led by Lachy Groom and Craft Ventures. Additional investors include Segment co-founder Calvin French-Owen, Lob CEO Leore Avidar, Firebase co-founder James Tamplin and early Dropbox engineer Aston Motes, among others. The company is a graduate of this year’s Y Combinator summer class.Co-founded by Joseph Nelson (CEO) and Brad Dwyer (CTO), Roboflow is the result of the team members’ previous work on AR and AI apps, including Magic Sudoku from 2017. After respectively exiting their last companies, the two co-founders teamed up again to launch a new AR project, this time with a focus on board games. In 2019, the team actually participated in the TC Disrupt hackathon to add chess support to that app — but in the process, the team also realized that it was spending a lot of time trying to solve the same problems that everybody else in the computer vision field was facing.Image Credits: Roboflow“In building both those [AR] products, we realized most of our time wasn’t spent on the board game part of it, it was spent on the image management, the annotation management, the understanding of ‘do we have enough images of white queens, for example? Do we have enough images from this angle or this angle? Are the rooms brighter or darker?’ This data mining of understanding in visual imagery is really underdeveloped. We had built a bunch of — at the time — internal tooling to make this easier for us,” Nelson explained. “And in the process of building this company, of trying to make software features for real-world objects, realize that developers didn’t need inspiration. They needed tooling.”So shortly after participating in the hackathon, the founders started putting together the first version of Roboflow and launched the first version a year ago in January 2020. And while the service started out as a platform for managing large image data sets, it has since grown to become an end-to-end solution for handling image management, analysis, pre-processing and augmentation, up to building the image recognition models and putting them into production. As Nelson noted, while the team didn’t set out to build an end-to-end solution, its users kept pushing the team to add more features.Image Credits: RoboflowSo far, about 20,000 developers have used the service, with use cases ranging from accelerating cancer research to smart city applications. The thesis here, Nelson said, is that computer vision is going to be useful for every single industry. But not every company has the in-house expertise to set up the infrastructure for building models and putting it into production, so Roboflow aims to provide an easy to use platform for this that individual developers and (over time) large enterprise teams can use to quickly iterate on their ideas.Roboflow plans to use the new funding to expand its team, which currently consists of five members, both on the engineering and go-to-market side.The Roboflow racoon. Image Credits: Roboflow“As small cameras become cheaper and cheaper, we’re starting to see an explosion of video and image data everywhere,” Segment co-founder and Roboflow investor French-Owen noted. “Historically, it’s been hard for anyone but the biggest tech companies to harness this data, and actually turn it into a valuable product. Roboflow is building the pipelines for the rest of us. They’re helping engineers take the data that tells a thousand words, and giving them the power to turn that data into recommendations and insights.”']",,"['NavigationClose ScreenRoboflow', 'RoboflowRoboflow', 'Lachy Groom', 'Craft Ventures', 'Calvin French-Owen', 'James Tamplin', 'Dropbox', 'Aston Motes', 'Joseph Nelson', 'Brad Dwyer', 'CTO', 'Roboflow', 'AR', 'AI', 'AR', 'the TC Disrupt', 'Nelson', 'Roboflow', 'Nelson', 'Nelson', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'GroomRoboflow', 'Lardinois5:00', 'Lachy Groom', 'Craft Ventures', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/TrODsEtGqM,2021-01-12T15:59:20,Walmart partners with smart box maker HomeValet for grocery delivery pilot,"['Walmart announced today it will soon begin to pilot a new solution that could eventually allow the retailer to deliver groceries to customers’ homes 24 hours per day. The company is partnering with HomeValet, the maker of a temperature-controlled smart box that’s placed outside the home. Customers’ groceries can be delivered, contact-free, to the secure box and kept cold at any time — even if the customer isn’t at home.The smart boxes will be tested initially with customers near Walmart’s headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, starting this spring. There won’t be a way to sign up for the service. Instead, Walmart will conduct outreach to its current delivery customers in Northwest Arkansas to learn of their interest in participating.The HomeValet boxes themselves are an Internet of Things platform that offers three temperature-controlled zones, making them capable of storing frozen, refrigerated and pantry items. The boxes communicate with the delivery provider’s device, which gives them secure access to the smart box at the time of the delivery to place the items inside.According to the HomeValet FAQ, the boxes also disinfect the exposed surfaces of delivered items as well as the inside of the box itself, in between deliveries, using UVC light.This could appeal to customers who have been trying to reduce their exposure to the novel coronavirus by wiping down all their groceries before putting them away. (The HomeValet website, however, makes no specific claims about COVID-19. Instead, it simply says the UV-C LED disinfection method it uses can create “inhospitable environments to microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, molds and other pathogens.”)HomeValet notes that Walmart customers will be the first to gain access to its boxes, as the product is just now going to market. The general public will be able to pre-order boxes for themselves later this year, with pricing still to be announced. HomeValet intends to eventually sell to both consumers and retailers.HomeValet, a D.C. Metro area-based startup, was founded by the father and son team of John and Jack Simms, years before the COVID-19 pandemic, with the goal of offering more secure home deliveries. However, the pandemic created a new sense of urgency inside the company to get their product to market as consumers’ needs transformed overnight and continued at an accelerated pace, they’ve said.GrubMarket raises $60M as food delivery stays center stageAs a result, HomeValet acquired an Indiana-based engineering firm, Envolve Engineering LLC, founded by former Whirlpool engineers, back in September. The company touted the deal at the time as a way to bring the capabilities of a Fortune 500 organization to its faster and more nimble startup.“Consumers want convenience and peace of mind now more than ever. HomeValet’s safe, temperature-controlled Smart Box and app can enable 24/7 secure deliveries whether customers are occupied at home or receiving remotely,” said John Simms, HomeValet co-founder and CEO. “We’re excited for Walmart customers to be some of the first to enjoy contactless, unattended home delivery,” he added.Though Walmart envisions how a smart box could allow it to expand its delivery hours, it won’t be offering 24/7 deliveries during the pilot. Instead, the focus of the pilot will be to learn more about if and how its customers like to interact with this technology and how Walmart might incorporate it into its operations going forward.HomeValet is one of many solutions to date that Walmart has tested to make grocery delivery more efficient. Not all those tests have rolled out broadly. For example, Walmart in 2019 began to trial an in-home grocery delivery service that allows Walmart delivery drivers to enter the home through a smart lock system and, in some cases, put groceries away in the customer’s fridge. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, Walmart pulled back on the in-kitchen program, which is still only operating in Pittsburgh. (InHome delivery is also offered in\xa0Kansas City, Vero Beach and West Palm Beach, but groceries are left inside the door.)Walmart didn’t disclose further details about the nature of its partnership with HomeValet, but said there’s no cost to the customers during the pilot period. More information will be available as the program goes to launch in the spring.Remote-controlled delivery carts are now working for the local Los Angeles grocer']",Lantern,"['NavigationClose', 'Walmart’s', 'UVC', 'the UV-C', 'Jack Simms', '’ve', 'GrubMarket', 'HomeValet', 'Envolve Engineering LLC', 'Smart', 'John Simms', 'COVID-19', 'door.)Walmart', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

New locales include Austin, Houston, Miami and New York City as part of the ride-hailing company’s broader plan to become a zero-emission platform by 2040.The program, known as Uber Green, gives customers the option to request an EV or hybrid electric vehicle. Drivers receive an extra $0.50 from a $1 rider surcharge for every Uber Green trip completed.\xa0Uber said Tuesday it is integrating the program into its Uber Pass membership service and will give members 10% off on “green” trips, the same discount provided for a standard ride.Of course, the success of Uber Green hinges on its ability to get drivers to make the switch. The company has set aside $800 million to get its drivers to use electric vehicles by 2025.Now, it’s beginning to roll out programs through partnerships with automakers, charging network providers, and EV rental and fleet companies to provide further incentives. Uber said Tuesday drivers in Los Angeles can rent electric vehicles through a partnership with Avis. The program will expand nationwide in 2021.\xa0\xa0Uber has also partnered with Ample. Starting this month, drivers in San Francisco  can rent a vehicle with Ample battery swapping technology, which lets them switch out the electric vehicle batteries in minutes.\xa0The company has also expanded its partnership with EVgo to give drivers on its ride-hailing platform access to charging discounts at more than 800 U.S. locations.Uber’s zero-emission goal will require more than getting drivers and riders to use EVs. The company is expanding other programs as well, including its journey-planning feature for public transit users. The feature, which is now available in more than 40 cities globally, is accessed through the Uber app and lets users plan their public transit journey and includes walking directions to stations and real-time schedules. The company said Tuesday it has added the feature for users in Atlanta, Auckland, Brisbane, Buenos Aires, Guadalajara, Philadelphia, Rome, Bangalore, Chennai and Mumbai.\xa0Uber said it is also bringing to Mexico City and London a multimodal trip planner that combines ride-hailing with walking directions and city bus, subway or train connections.

https://t.co/KPOR8NotT8,2021-01-12T15:23:37,2021: A SPAC odyssey,"['There are a number of ways to take a private company public: You can pursue a traditional IPO, sell a chunk of shares at a set price and start trading. You can direct list and merely start to trade. You can host a hybrid auction-offering, like what Unity did.Hell, Google showed us back in the day that a reverse-Dutch auction is possible, after which no one else deigned to try it.And then there’s the blank-check method: Instead of taking your company private, some rich people list a pile of hungry money instead and then go hunting for a private company to merge with. If you consent, the money bucket and your actual company merge, renaming themselves after your operating entity. This is a SPAC-led debut.The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.And it’s what we’re discussing today, because there are a few upstarts going public via special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs, or blank-check companies) worth checking out.One deals with bitcoin, and one is a huge consumer-facing fintech that has a stadium named after itself. In the case of Bakkt, the cryptocurrency-powering entity, a SPAC made some sense at first blush. SoFi, on the surface, seemed less obvious. (Bakkt is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, an exchange-focused, public company. It has raised money from Microsoft as well.)This morning I want to dig through the two offerings’ investor presentations to see what we can learn. After viewing the Opendoor-SPAC presentation, I had a few questions heading into the new deals. The first was whether SPACs were going to be used again to lift potentially promising companies that lacked obvious, near-term growth stories to the public markets. If so, perhaps SPACs would wind up helping get more total companies public, which would not be a bad thing.Especially given how many unicorns the private markets are birthing\xa0ahead of the public market’s ability to IPO them all; maybe SPACs would help close the liquidity gap?So, does that very modest hypothesis fit with Bakkt and SoFi? And what can Bakkt tell us about Coinbase’s impending IPO and SoFi about the state of consumer fintech? Let’s find out.SPAC me baby one more timeWe’ll start with Bakkt. You can read its release, including all the messy details of a SPAC-led combination here. The piece you need to know is that the resulting, combined company will have an enterprise value of around $2.1 billion and more than $500 million in cash after all elements of the deal are closed.So the market should soon have a publicly traded, cryptocurrency-focused business that is loaded with cash. Fun!Next we want to know how healthy Bakkt is as a business, which brings us to its investor presentation, which you can read here. The presentation stresses that Bakkt is backed by major companies, a plus for public investors who might still be skittish about bitcoin. It also stresses that Bakkt will handle a host of digital tokens instead of just cryptocurrencies.Bakkt’s point that airline miles and other nonmonetary rewards are related to decentralized cryptocurrencies in that they are digital tokens is worth considering. Bakkt views the breadth of its supported asset classes as both an advantage over its competitors, and something that it is expanding. Equities trading is coming soon, which will allow users to view even more of their digitally held assets in one place.Then we get to the results section of the presentation, which includes what I think is the most egregious chart of all time:Akin to calling One America News Network “conservative,” this chart stretches the word’s definition somewhat. Image Credits: BakktObserve how competitors are denoted with\xa0actual data, while Bakkt bests them all with\xa0projections. Oof. So when it comes to what we can learn today from Bakkt about the impending Coinbase IPO I think that the answer is “not much.” Oh well.We raise the above chart not merely to gently mock some of its embedded optimism, but also to note how nascent Bakkt’s consumer app really is. Per the company itself, it has yet to really launch:Image Credits: BakktThis leads to the “results” shared being pretty heavy on speculation. Indeed, they are nearly all speculation.

BrightDrop has other products in mind and is tinkering with a few concepts, including a medium-distance vehicle that transports multiple electric pallets known as EP1 as well as a rapid load delivery vehicle concept, which was teased Tuesday.Image Credits: GM/screenshotThis isn’t just a vehicle play, however. GM has also developed a suite of software tools to offer an EV ecosystem for the commercial marketplace. It’s also setting up a dealership network to support sales and service and plans to help commercial customers set up charging infrastructure.The\xa0cloud-based software platform, which can be accessed on the web or by mobile app, will give users information to improve operations, including the best delivery routes and other fleet management features, according to GM. The electric van and pallet will have an array of connected features designed to give customers better ways to monitor and manage the vehicles, including location monitoring, battery status and remote commands to lock and unlock.\xa0Image Credits: GMBrightDrop is the latest “startup” to spin out of the automaker’s Global Innovation effort, an in-house organization that has led to the launch of OnStar Insurance, OnStar Guardian and GM Defense. Travis Katz, who was an entrepreneur-in-residence at Redpoint Ventures, has been named CEO and president of BrightDrop.\xa0The idea for BrightDrop was sparked by a team within the Global Innovation organization that was evaluating the growth of e-commerce and consumer demand for online delivery, which has been exacerbated by COVID-19.“The more we learned about the demand and the challenges of delivery and logistics from that first mile to literally the last five feet, the more we saw the opportunity to leverage GM’s expertise in things like electrification, mobility applications, telematics, fleet management to help businesses move goods and services in a smarter and more sustainable way,” Pam Fletcher, vice president of Global Innovation at General Motors, said in a media briefing ahead of the announcement.That opportunity is a substantial one, based on GM’s estimates. The automaker said that by\xa02025, the combined market opportunity for parcel, food delivery and reverse logistics in the U.S. will be more than $850 billion. Demand for urban last-mile delivery is expected to grow by 78% by 2030, leading to a 36% increase in delivery vehicles in the world’s top 100 cities, according to the World Economic Forum. At the same time, this increase in demand is expected to cause delivery-related carbon emissions to rise by nearly one-third.The EP1Image Credits: GMThe business unit’s first product is called the EP1, a propulsion-assisted electric pallet developed to move goods over short distances. For instance, it might be used to shuttle goods from a warehouse to a delivery van. The pod will be available in early 2021.The EP1 has a built-in electric hub motor that can travel up to 3 miles per hour. The pod’s speed will adjust depending on the operator’s walking pace.The EP1, which GM says is designed to maneuver in tight spaces, can hold about 23 cubic feet of cargo space and carry a payload of up to 200 pounds. Inside the pod are adjustable shelves and lockable cabinet doors to allow for remote access to whatever goods are being transported.FedEx recently completed a pilot program testing the EP1.\xa0FedEx Express couriers were able to safely handle 25% more packages per day with the EP1s, according to GM.BrightDrop and FedEx Express have another pilot scheduled to take place in a major urban center in the U.S. this quarter.\xa0The EV600Image Credits: GMThe electric delivery van is a vehicle designed and built off of GM’s Ultium architecture — the heart of the company’s EV strategy. The first vans will be delivered to FedEx at the end of this year. BrightDrop expects to make the EV600s available to more customers to order starting in early 2022.The vehicle will be able to travel an estimated 250 miles on a single charge. Its peak charge rate will be up to 170 miles of EV range per hour via 120kW DC fast charging, according to GM.The inside is roomy, with 600 cubic feet of cargo area, and comes with a security system to keep goods safe. There is a 13.4-inch diagonal, full-color infotainment screen, front sliding pocket doors, wide cabin walkways and a large auto-open cargo bulkhead door.\xa0The electric van comes standard with advanced driver assistance tech found in its consumer vehicles, including front and rear park assist, automatic emergency braking and other warnings to keep the driver in the lane. The van also comes standard with a forward collision alert, following distance indicator, front pedestrian braking and automatic high beams and HD Rear Vision Camera.Customers can pump up the safety features and add options such as rear cross-traffic braking, blind-zone steering assist, reverse automatic braking, HD surround vision, rear pedestrian alert and enhanced automatic emergency braking.']",FTC settlement,"['GM', 'EV', 'BrightDrop', 'NavigationClose', 'EV', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'GMGM', 'FedEx', 'BrightDrop', 'CES', 'BrightDrop', 'GM', 'GM', 'EV', 'GM', 'GMBrightDrop', 'Global Innovation', 'OnStar Insurance', 'OnStar Guardian', 'GM Defense', 'Travis Katz', 'Redpoint Ventures', 'BrightDrop', 'BrightDrop', 'Global Innovation', 'GM', 'Pam Fletcher', 'Global Innovation at General Motors', 'GM’s', 'the World Economic Forum', 'GM', 'FedEx', 'FedEx Express', 'GM.BrightDrop', 'FedEx Express', 'GM’s', 'FedEx', 'BrightDrop', 'EV', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'MotorsGMGM', 'EV', 'Korosec3:33', 'FedEx', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Advanced care directives have to be carefully disseminated to healthcare providers and strictly followed. Property has to be divided and transferred while meeting relevant estate laws. And of course, there are the logistics of a funeral, cremation or other option that has its own serious complexities, costs and choices.The worst time to figure out how to die is when you die. The best time to figure it out is precisely when you don’t have to.For New York City-headquartered Lantern, the goal is to initiate those conversations early and give its users significantly better peace-of-mind, particularly in these dolorous times.The company offers essentially a “how-to” platform for beginning to prepare for end-of-life, offering checklists and monitoring to ensure that the vast majority of details are figured out in advance. In some cases, the startup will handle the underlying details itself, while in other areas like estate planning, it works with partners such as Trust & Will, which we have profiled a number of times on TechCrunch.Right now, the company has two plans: a simple free one and a $27 / year plan that tracks your progress on end-of-life planning and allows you to collaborate with family, friends or whoever else needs to be part of your decision-making. The company is in the process of adding other à la carte options for additional fees.Trust & Will raises $15M as digital estate planning hits mainstreamLast month, the company raised $1.4 million in a seed round led by Draper Associates with a few other firms involved. Earlier, the company raised a pre-seed round of $890,000 from the likes of 2048 Ventures, Amplify and others, bringing its total raised to date to $2.3 million. The company is organized as a public-benefit corporation and was founded in September 2018, and first launched a year later.For founders Liz Eddy and Alyssa Ruderman, Lantern was an opportunity to tackle a looming problem in a compassionate and empathetic way. “I started my first company when I was 15,” Eddy, who is CEO, said. That company focused on dating abuse and domestic violence education for high school and later college students. “I really fell in love with the pace and variety of starting something new, but also in creating conversations around topics that people really don’t want to talk about and making it more palatable and comfortable,“ she said.Lantern co-founders Alyssa Ruderman and Liz Eddy. Photo via Lantern.Later, she joined local suicide prevention nonprofit Crisis Text Line, which has an SMS-based network of crisis counselors who are trained to calm people and begin their process of recovery. She spent more than six years at the organization.As for Ruderman, who is COO of Lantern, she most recently spent two years at Global Citizen, a nonprofit organization focused on ending extreme poverty. The two connected and incubated Lantern at startup accelerator Grand Central Tech.The idea for better end-of-life planning came from personal experience. “I lost my dad when I was in elementary school,” Eddy said, “and saw firsthand how loss and grief impacts a family financially, emotionally, logistically, legally — every aspect.”Today, many of these processes are offline, and the online products mostly available today are focused on individual elements of end-of-life planning, such as estate planning or selecting and purchasing a casket. Eddy and Ruderman saw an opportunity to provide a more holistic experience with a better product while also initiating these conversations earlier.That pre-planning part of the product was launched just as the pandemic was getting underway last year, and Eddy said that “we had a sort of a really interesting launch where people were starting to come to terms with their own mortality in a way we hadn’t seen in a very long time.” Typical users so far have been between 25 and 35 years old, and many people start planning when they have a major life event. Eddy says that the death of a family member is an obvious trigger, but so is having a baby or starting a company.One aspect that Eddy emphasized repeatedly was that having a will and pre-planning for end-of-life are not equivalent. “Even if you don’t have a dollar to your name after you pass away, there are a ton of other things that your loved ones, family members, whoever’s responsible has to consider,” she said.From a product perspective, there are some nuances compared to your more typical SaaS startup. For one, the company needs to engage you regularly, but not too frequently. Unlike, say, a wedding, which is a single event that then is over, your documents and directives need to be occasionally edited and updated as a user’s life circumstances change.Beyond that, one of the largest challenges with a product that talks about death is building a connection with a user that doesn’t seem cold, and, well, Silicon Valley-like. “Even as a product that is entirely virtual, making sure that you really feel that human connection throughout” is a high priority, Eddy said. “We use a lot of empathetic language, and our imagery, all of the illustrations are done by illustrators who have lost someone in memory of the person who’s lost.”Longevity startups may remain a thesis for some VC investors, but handling the end — no matter when — is an activity every person faces. Lantern might shine just a bit more light on what is otherwise a debilitating and scary prospect.']",can produce “thousands”,"['Lantern', 'Trust & Will', 'Trust & Will', 'Draper Associates', '2048 Ventures', 'Liz Eddy', 'Alyssa Ruderman', 'Lantern', 'Alyssa Ruderman', 'Liz Eddy', 'Lantern', 'Crisis Text Line', 'Ruderman', 'COO of Lantern', 'Global Citizen', 'Lantern', 'Grand Central Tech', 'Ruderman', 'Eddy', 'Eddy', 'VC', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/4iJsI1n2kJ,2021-01-12T14:00:44,Cockroach Labs scores $160M Series E on $2B valuation,"['Cockroach Labs, makers of CockroachDB, have been on a fundraising roll for the last couple of years. Today the company announced a $160 million Series E on a fat $2 billion valuation. The round comes just eight months after the startup raised an $86.6 million Series D.The latest investment was led by Altimeter Capital, with participation from new investors Greenoaks and Lone Pine, along with existing investors Benchmark, Bond, FirstMark, GV, Index Ventures and Tiger Global. The round doubled the company’s previous valuation and increased the amount raised to $355 million.Co-founder and CEO Spencer Kimball says the company’s revenue more than doubled in 2020 in spite of COVID, and that caught the attention of investors. He attributed this paradoxical rise to the rapid shift to the cloud brought on by the pandemic that many people in the industry have seen.“People became more aggressive with what was already underway, a real move to embrace the cloud to build the next generation of applications and services, and that’s really fundamentally where we are,” Kimball told me.As that happened, the company began a shift in thinking. While it has embraced an open-source version of CockroachDB along with a 30-day free trial on the company’s cloud service as ways to attract new customers to the top of the funnel, it wants to try a new approach.In fact, it plans to replace the 30-day trial with a newer version later this year without any time limits. It believes this will attract more developers to the platform and enable them to see the full set of features without having to enter credit card information. What’s more, by taking this approach, it should end up costing the company less money to support the free tier.“What we expect is that you can do all kinds of things on that free tier. You can do a hackathon, any kind of hobby project […] or even a startup that has ambitions to be the next DoorDash or Airbnb,” he said. As he points out, there’s a point where early-stage companies don’t have many users, and can remain in the free tier until they achieve product-market fit.“That’s when they put a credit card down, and they can extend beyond the free tier threshold and pay for what they use,” he said. The newer free tier is still in the beta testing phase, but will be rolled out during this year.Kimball says the company wasn’t necessarily looking to raise, although he knew that it would continue to need more cash on the balance sheet to run with giant competitors like Oracle, AWS and the other big cloud vendors, along with a slew of other database startups. As the company’s revenue grows, he certainly sees an IPO in its future, but he doesn’t see it happening this year.Cockroach Labs launches CockroachDB as managed serviceThe startup ended the year with 200 employees and Kimball expects to double that by the end of this year. He says growing a diverse group of employees takes good internal data and building a welcoming and inclusive culture.“I think the starting point for anything you want to optimize in a business is to make sure that you have the metrics in front of you, and that you’re constantly looking at them […] in order to measure how you’re doing,” he explained.He added, “The thing that we’re most focused on in terms of action is really building the culture of the company appropriately and that’s something we’ve been doing for all six years we’ve been around. To the extent that you have an inclusive environment where people actually really view the value of respect, that helps with diversity.”Kimball says he sees a different approach to running the business when the pandemic ends, with some small percentage going into the office regularly and others coming for quarterly visits, but he doesn’t see a full return to the office post-pandemic.Cockroach Labs scores $86.6M Series D as scalable database resonates']",Taiwan Tech Arena,"['Cockroach Labs', 'NavigationClose', 'Altimeter Capital', 'FirstMark', 'GV', 'Tiger Global', 'Spencer Kimball', 'Kimball', 'DoorDash', 'Kimball', 'Oracle', 'Cockroach Labs', 'Kimball', 'Cockroach Labs', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/UfMTQPRJeB,2021-01-12T13:59:23,Uber and Moderna partner on COVID-19 vaccine access and information,"['Uber and pharmaceutical company Moderna have announced a partnership around COVID-19 vaccination, which will include a number of different initiatives. To start, its only confirmed component is to provide users with credible, factual information about COVID-19 vaccine safety through Uber’s consumer app, but the companies have also discussed additional “options,” including building ride scheduling via Uber directly into the immunization appointment booking process.Still in its early days, the U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program is already beset with challenges, including providing timely access to vaccines to swaths of the population who need it most. The inoculation program also has to contend with significant misinformation proliferating on social media about vaccine safety, and any app with the surface area of something like Uber has a chance to get positive messages and accurate information in front of a lot of people, so that’s good news on its own.Healthvana’s digital COVID-19 vaccination records are about communication, not passports for the immuneBut one of the very real challenges to an effective vaccination campaign remains logistical, and getting people to make their initial and follow-up appointments for the first round of the Moderna vaccine, and its second shot booster, is a bigger challenge than many might suspect. I spoke to Healthvana CEO Ramin Bastani about their work with LA County on creating an immunization record that integrates with Apple Wallet to provide patients with timely info and reminders about vaccination appointments, but integrating a ride-booking service or appointment reminder directly in the Uber app that most users already have on their phone anyway could be another very effective way to increase success rates for first and follow-up inoculation visits.FDA authorizes Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency useUber has already offered up free and discounted rides to help lower the friction of actually going out and getting a vaccine, but a product-level integration could do a lot more than that by providing easy, user-friendly access. As noted, this is still just one of the options being discussed, but if Uber and Moderna are willing to commit it to print, that at least means they’re serious about trying to find a way. We’re holding them to account, too, so rest assured we’ll follow up on their progress as this collaboration develops.']",Jedox,"['Kirill Kukhmar', 'Moderna', 'Uber', 'Healthvana', 'Healthvana', 'Ramin Bastani', 'Apple Wallet', 'FDA', 'Moderna’s', 'Uber', 'Moderna', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAppsHealthTCTransportationHealthvanamedicinemodernaModerna TherapeuticsPharmaceuticalsocial', 'Moderna', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/0C10ZKG5Gh,2021-01-12T13:43:52,FTC settlement with Ever orders data and AIs deleted after facial recognition pivot,"['The maker of a defunct cloud photo storage app that pivoted to selling facial recognition services has been ordered to delete user data and any algorithms trained on it, under the terms of an FTC settlement.The regulator investigated complaints the Ever app — which gained earlier notoriety for using dark patterns to spam users’ contacts — had applied facial recognition to users’ photographs without properly informing them what it was doing with their selfies.Under the proposed settlement, Ever must delete photos and videos of users who deactivated their accounts and also delete all face embeddings (i.e. data related to facial features which can be used for facial recognition purposes) that it derived from photos of users who did not give express consent to such a use.Moreover, it must delete any facial recognition models or algorithms developed with users’ photos or videos.This full suite of deletion requirements — not just data but anything derived from it and trained off of it — is causing great excitement in legal and tech policy circles, with experts suggesting it could have implications for\xa0 other facial recognition software trained on data that wasn’t lawfully processed.Or, to put it another way, tech giants that surreptitiously harvest data to train AIs could find their algorithms in hot water with the US regulator.This is revolutionary – and fascinating to see the US beats the EU in drawing this consequence https://t.co/20evtGaZM5— Mireille Hildebrandt (@mireillemoret) January 12, 2021Imagine requiring a firm like @Facebook or @Google to delete “models and algorithms” that relied on deceptively collected information.That could require deleting the core ML models underlying  Facebook Newsfeed or Google SearchKinda major…/cc @rcalo @hartzog— ashkan soltani (@ashk4n) January 12, 2021The quick background here is that the Ever app shut down last August, claiming it had been squeezed out of the market by increased competition from tech giants like Apple and Google.However the move followed an investigation by NBC News — which in 2019 reported that app maker Everalbum had pivoted to selling facial recognition services to private companies, law enforcement and the military (using the brand name Paravision) — apparently repurposing people’s family snaps to train face reading AIs.NBC reported Ever had only added a “brief reference” to the new use in its privacy policy after journalists contacted it to ask questions about the pivot in April of that year.In a press release yesterday, reported\xa0earlier by The Verge, the FTC announced the proposed settlement with Ever received unanimous backing from commissioners.One commissioner, Rohit Chopra, issued a standalone statement in which he warns that current gen facial recognition technology is “fundamentally flawed and reinforces harmful biases”, saying he supports “efforts to enact moratoria or otherwise severely restrict its use”.“Until such time, it is critical that the FTC meaningfully enforce existing law to deprive wrongdoers of technologies they build through unlawful collection of Americans’ facial images and likenesses,” he adds.Chopra’s statement highlights the fact that commissioners have previously voted to allow data protection law violators to retain algorithms and technologies that “derive much of their value from ill-gotten data”, as he puts it — flagging an earlier settlement with Google and YouTube under which the tech giant was allowed to retain algorithms and other technologies “enhanced by illegally obtained data on children”.And he dubs the Ever decision “an important course correction”.Children’s privacy costs just $170 million for Google in settlement with the FTCEver has not been fined under the settlement — something Chopra describes as “unfortunate” (saying it’s related to commissioners “not having restated this precedent into a rule under Section 18 of the FTC Act”).He also highlights the fact that Ever avoided processing the facial data of a subset of users in States which have laws against facial recognition and the processing of biometric data — citing that as an example of “why it’s important to maintain States’ authority to protect personal data”. (NB: Ever also avoided processing EU users’ biometric data; another region with data protection laws.)“With the tsunami of data being collected on individuals, we need all hands on deck to keep these companies in check,” he goes on. “State and local governments have rightfully taken steps to enact bans, moratoria, and other restrictions on the use of these technologies. While special interests are actively lobbying for federal legislation to delete state data protection laws, it will be important for Congress to resist these efforts. Broad federal preemption would severely undercut this multifront approach and leave more consumers less protected.“It will be critical for the Commission, the states, and regulators around the globe to pursue additional enforcement actions to hold accountable providers of facial recognition technology who make false accuracy claims and engage in unfair, discriminatory conduct.”Tech in the Biden eraParavision has been contacted for comment on the FTC settlement.Update: Paravision sent us this statement via email:The FTC Consent Order reflects a change that has already taken place. The Ever service was closed in August 2020 and the company has no plans to run a consumer business moving forward. In September 2020, Paravision released its latest-generation face recognition model which does not use any Ever users’ data. The consent order mirrors the course we had already set and reinforces a mindful tone as we look ahead.Face recognition and computer vision technology have the potential to improve our lives in profound ways and we take the gravity of its impacts extremely seriously. Paravision has been repeatedly recognized by the U.S. Government through NIST as the most accurate provider of face recognition from the U.S., UK, and Europe. We look forward to maintaining this position with our latest generation model, and are deeply committed to the ethical development and use of this technology.']",Tessera Therapeutics,"['FTC', 'NavigationClose', 'Lomas@riptari', 'FTC', 'EU', 'Mireille Hildebrandt', '@Facebook', '@Google', 'ML', 'Facebook Newsfeed', 'Google SearchKinda', 'Apple', 'NBC News', 'Everalbum', 'NBC', 'Verge', 'FTC', 'Rohit Chopra', 'FTC', 'Chopra’s', 'Google', 'YouTube', 'Google', 'FTCEver', 'Chopra', 'FTC', 'NB', 'EU', 'Congress', 'Commission', 'FTC', 'FTC', 'Paravision', 'the U.S. Government', 'NIST', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'IntelligencePrivacybiometricsdata', 'Lomas2:43 PM GMT+1•January 12', 'FTC', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Archer aims to start production of its eVTOLs at scale beginning in 2023, with an initial unveiling to occur early this year.The new team-up will see FCA provide input that contributes to the design of Archer’s eVTOL cockpit, as well, another area where the automaker has ample expertise, since it has designed spaces for drivers for many decades in its automotive business. Archer’s aircraft will be powered by an electric motor, and will be able to fly for up to 60 miles at top speeds of 150 mph. The Archer eVTOL is designed to be quiet and efficient, with efforts from the FCA collaboration going toward lowering the cost of its manufacturing to make high-volume manufacturing achievable and sustainable.Ultimately, Archer is looking to FCA to help it realize efficiencies in its process that can make bringing its eVTOL to market a sound business that can also be accessed affordably by end users. Palo Alto-based Archer is looking to ultimately scale production to the point where it can produce “thousands” of its eVTOL aircraft per year, for use in future air taxi services serving cities globally.Based in Palo Alto and led by co-founders Brett Adcock and Adam Goldstein, and including industry executives like Chief Engineer Geoff Bower, who previously served in that role at Airbus’ Vahana eVTOL initiative, Archer launched out of stealth earlier this year with backing from Marc Lore, current president and CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce business (he was co-founder and CEO of Jet when it was acquired by the retailer).Air taxi company EHang flies autonomously in the US for the first time']",Skyrora,"['FCA', 'NavigationClose', 'FCA', 'ArcherArcher', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobiles', 'FCA', 'Archer’s eVTOL', 'FCA', 'Archer', 'FCA', 'Brett Adcock', 'Adam Goldstein', 'Engineer Geoff Bower', 'Airbus’ Vahana eVTOL', 'Archer', 'Walmart’s', 'EHang', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Chrysler', 'AutomobilesmanufacturingMarc', 'LoreAir', 'FCA', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobile', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Today, a company that is providing the platform to do that is announcing a significant fundraise to tap into that opportunity.Jedox, a German startup that builds tools to help companies with their financial planning and analysis using data sourced from basic documents like Excel spreadsheets, has picked up a funding of over $100 million — it’s not specifying exactly how much — in a round being led by Insight Partners, with Iris Capital, eCAPITAL and Wecken & Cie. (all previous backers) also participating. The company currently works with some 2,500 customers, including big players like Microsoft, McDonald’s and industrial giant ABB.The company’s software was originally built to work on-premises or in the cloud, and mainly oriented toward financial planners. Over the last several years, Jedox has expanded that to a wider set of adjacent users, specifically in HR planning and procurement, and the plan with this funding is to expand Jedox’s applicability into an even wider set of use cases and verticals. CEO Florian Winterstein — who joined the company in 2018 during its last fundraise — said that while Jedox the name doesn’t have any particular meaning, the company has landed on a focus on the “X”.“We want to focus on more than just the finance department,” he said, and the company thinks of FPNA (financial planning and analysis) “as XPNA” as a result. Expanding beyond their original verticals “is what everyone in enterprise is doing right now.”Insight closes $9.5B fund to help support portfolio companies through the pandemicThe company has raised around $150 million to date, and Winterstein said that Jedox is not disclosing its valuation with this round. But he confirmed that Insight took a majority investment, and that this funding comes on the heels of a lot of demand from financial and strategic investors to back the company. The company counts Microsoft and Salesforce (prolific strategic investors in the startup world) among its partners and sometime customers today — as well as acquisition offers from enterprise resource planning companies due to its traction and presence in the market.“We have been approached tons of times, maybe every month, by companies from our space, from others in the area of financial services, and those looking for better tools to integrate into a wider suite of enterprise services,” he said. He called those approaches “interesting” but also said the startup was equally considering an IPO route in several years — the route that its closest competitor, Anaplan, has taken, he points out. In any case, there are no plans for an exit anytime soon with growth going strong.Jedox got its start way back in 2002, and in a way is a very typical European startup story. Winterstein notes that its efforts were all open source-based and that the company was “not commercial at all, a lot of tech geeks and German engineering types that were not overly experienced in go-to-market strategies.”That started to change over time, with Winterstein coming in and the founders stepping away, and the company also making its own shift, away from the open-source model among the many changes that have taken place. (The open-source elements, however, still alive and well, collected mostly around the Palo open-source standard.) Jedox, said Winterstein, is all-in on cloud services now, with SaaS making up 75% of its revenues, and the remainder mostly being about professional services related to that.(The focus on professional services ushered by Winterstein is notable, considering his track record. Before this role, he led and founded a number of companies, two of which have been acquired by IBM, which arguably leads and dominates the market of building tech with professional services wrapped around it.)For a lot of tech watchers and especially those in enterprise, these days when people talk about modeling, thoughts often spring immediately to artificial intelligence and things like big data machine learning, and that’s not too much of a surprise: AI is really the flavor of the month at the moment.A lot of that, however, can be misleading. I’ve heard more than one tech person complain about how a lot of what is pitched and peddled as AI is not really that.What’s quite refreshing is that Jedox does not try do that itself.“I get kind of annoyed by ‘what is AI’,” he said when I brought this up. “It may be simple predictions and statistical modeling they are doing.” He is quick to say that “not everything we do is AI, and if you look at our customer distribution, roughly 100 of our 2,500 customers are really using AI. Others are using what others may call AI but in the definition of what AI actually is, it is not.”He said that Jedox is not without AI in its systems for modeling and giving a better picture of what might happen at a business when considering different factors, but that Jedox does not in all cases develop those algorithms itself.“There are around 20-25 algorithms out there and we don’t think it’s necessary to create the next algorithm,” he said. Instead, the company taps AI services provided by the likes of Google, Microsoft and others to run its services on a backbone, built by Jedox, “that throws user or customer data on various AI services and our backbone to figure out which algorithm suits the data and use case of the customer best.”Companies like Palantir have really brought to light how modeling and predictive insights can be used to an organization’s advantage. Jedox’s unique selling point is that it’s doing something like this but on a more actionable basis for average workers.“Jedox offers a differentiated approach to financial planning through its flexibility, familiar Excel-based interface and focus on the customer,” said Jeff Lieberman, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with Florian and the Jedox team to bring market-leading cloud planning tools to industry leaders in every vertical, across the globe.” Rachel Geller, another MD at Insight Partners, and Henry Frankievich, principal, will be joining the board of directors with the round.Insight Partners, Precursor Ventures join Hustle Fund in raising new fund money']",highlight virtual services,"['NavigationClose ScreenJedox', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Melpomenem / Getty ImagesOrganizations', 'Insight Partners', 'Iris Capital', 'Wecken & Cie', 'Microsoft', 'McDonald’s', 'Florian Winterstein', 'FPNA', 'Winterstein', 'Insight', 'Microsoft', 'Salesforce', 'Anaplan', 'Winterstein', 'Winterstein', 'IBM', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'AI', 'Google', 'Microsoft', 'AI', 'Palantir', 'Jedox’s', 'Jeff Lieberman', 'Insight Partners', 'Rachel Geller', 'Insight Partners', 'Henry Frankievich', 'Insight Partners', 'Precursor Ventures', 'Hustle Fund', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'PartnersJedoxStartupsJedox', 'Lunden2:18', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/rgW0QZorty,2021-01-12T13:11:47,Programmable genetics gets more cash as Tessera Therapeutics gets a $230 million infusion,"['Technologists are getting better at coding biology and venture firms are flooding a new generation of startups with cash so they can commercialize their technology bringing in the next wave of genetic innovation.Tessera Therapeutics, the Boston-based spin-up from Flagship Pioneering, is the latest company to enter the mix with $230 million in new financing to build up its platform for better biological programming.The round was led by Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., Altitude Life Science Ventures and the second SoftBank Vision Fund, with participation from the Qatari Investment Authority and other undisclosed investors.Last year, the company took the covers off its gene-writing service, which combined an array of different gene editing, manufacturing and synthesizing technologies to provide more tailored therapeutic instructions to genetic code.By providing more instructions to genetic material, the company aims to increase the precision of therapies while expanding the number of potential pathogens or mutations they can target, the company said in a statement.The thesis is similar to the approach taken by companies like Senti Bio, another early-stage biotech company that raised $105 million earlier this month.Senti Bio raises $105 million for its new programmable biology platform and cancer therapies“The ability to write in the code of life will be a defining technology of this century and drive a fundamental change in medicine. Today’s support is a testament to Tessera’s outstanding team of scientists and our focus on bringing the extraordinary promise of Gene Writing to patients,” said Geoffrey von Maltzahn, CEO and co-founder of Tessera Therapeutics, and a partner at Flagship Pioneering. “We look forward to turning this powerful technology into a new category of medicines.”Part of a number of companies focused on gene therapies and gene-editing technologies that have been developed under the Flagship Pioneering umbrella, Tessera Therapeutics focuses on the development of new therapies that will use messenger RNA, targeted fusogenic vectors and epigenetic controllers, according to Flagship Pioneering founder and chief executive Noubar Afeyan, who also serves as the chair and co-founder of Tessera.While Senti Bio is adding more programming to existing genetic material, Tessera uses mobile genetic elements, the most abundant genetic material in the body to create new vectors for writing and rewriting the human genome.The company asserts that this represents a breakthrough in genetic engineering, which can build better therapies. That’s because the technology can target very specific sites in the genome to make any substitutions, insertions or deletions in genetic code. Tessera also said that its tech allows for more efficient engineering of somatic cell genomes without double stranded-breaks and with very little reliance on DNA repair pathways.Gene writing is inspired by and builds upon the shoulders of nature’s most prevalent class of genes: mobile genetic elements. Tessera’s computational and high-throughput laboratory platform has enabled the team to design, build and test thousands of engineered and synthetic mobile genetic elements for writing and rewriting the human genome.The company said it can also write entirely new sequences into the genome by delivering only RNA.With the new round of funding, Tessera said it would look to further develop its tech, hire more staff and establish manufacturing and automation capabilities critical for its platform and programs.']",final tally,"['Tessera Therapeutics', 'NavigationClose', 'Tessera Therapeutics', 'Tessera Therapeutics', 'Flagship Pioneering', 'Alaska Permanent Fund Corp.', 'Altitude Life Science Ventures', 'SoftBank Vision Fund', 'the Qatari Investment Authority', 'Senti Bio', 'Senti Bio', 'Gene Writing', 'Geoffrey von Maltzahn', 'Tessera Therapeutics', 'Flagship Pioneering', 'Tessera Therapeutics', 'RNA', 'Flagship Pioneering', 'Noubar Afeyan', 'Senti Bio', 'Tessera', 'Tessera', 'Tessera', 'Tessera', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'FundingScienceStartupsTCAlaska Permanent Fund Corp.', 'Tessera Therapeutics', 'Shieber2:11', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

On Christmas Eve at its testing facility in Fife, Scotland, the team performed a third-stage static fire engine test onboard a new vehicle that will ultimately carry satellites to their final destination. But what’s more interesting is that the vehicle can refire its engine several times in orbit and conduct multiple missions in a single trip. This makes it a “Space Tug” able to perform a number of maneuvers in space, including the extraction of space junk or maintenance if satellites are already in orbit.Skyrora went through one of the early Space Camp accelerator programmes from Seraphim Capital.The Space Tug is the first “mission ready” vehicle of its kind to be developed in the U.K., and once in orbit it can navigate to any location under its own power, with the ability to make multiple stops, etc.The Space Tug is powered by a 3D-printed 3.5kN engine and the first stage of is launch is fuelled using an eco-friendly fuel (Ecosene) made in part from waste plastics.Launch startup Skyrora successfully tests 3D-printed rocket engines powered by plastic wasteVolodymyr Levykin, CEO of Skyrora, commented: “We have been deliberately quiet about this aspect of our Skyrora XL launch vehicle as we had huge technical challenges to get it to this stage and we wanted to ensure all tests had a satisfactory outcome, which they now have. With the current climate and a real shortage of good news, we feel it is the right time to share this with the world… We aim not only to conduct efficient launches from U.K. soil in the most environmentally friendly way, but then also to ensure that each single launch mission has the possibility of conducting the level of work that would have historically taken multiple launches.”Sir Tim Peake, astronaut, commented: “It’s fantastic that companies such as Skyrora are persisting in their ambition to make the U.K. a ‘launch state’. By driving forward and constantly investing into their engineering capabilities, the U.K. continues to benefit from these impressive milestones achieved. In undertaking a full fire test of their third stage, which fulfils the function of an Orbital Manoeuvring Vehicle capable of delivering satellites into precision orbits, Skyrora is one step closer to launch readiness. This vehicle will also be able to perform vital services such as satellite removal, refuelling and replacement and debris removal from orbit.”Rocket startup Skyrora achieves a successful sub-orbital launch from Scottish island']",LAUNCHub Ventures,"['NavigationClose', 'Seraphim Capital', 'Levykin', 'XL', 'Tim Peake', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsEuropeSpaceStartupsTClaunch', 'Butcher1:54 PM', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/AnlaZZQbX2,2021-01-12T12:01:40,Jobber raises $60M as its platform for home services professionals hits 100K users,"['One of the technology byproducts of the COVID-19 pandemic is that it has raised the game for businesses to have better digital tools in place to interface with customers, and their own work, to get things done. Today, a company called Jobber, which has built a platform doing just that for a particular segment of the market — home services professionals — is announcing a round of funding as it finds its business growing.The Canadian startup has picked up $60 million in funding. The equity round is being led by Summit Partners, with participation from previous backers OMERS Ventures and Version One Ventures, and new investors Tech Pioneers Fund.Jobber’s platform is focused around management software to help sole-traders and small home services businesses make appointments and organize their schedules, set up billing and manage their accounts, and market their services online. The funding round comes at a time when Jobber already has some 100,000 customers across 47 countries and 50 service segments, including cleaning, electrical repairs, landscaping, plumbing and more.That is but a small piece of the opportunity: Jobber estimates that home services and other tradespeople make up a workforce of some 5 million in the U.S. alone, contributing over $550 billion to the economy annually.Jobber’s rise comes at a key moment not just in the macroeconomic sense but also in the world of technology.A vast swathe of businesses in a number of sectors — for example, finance, HR, medicine, commerce, education and more — have spent decades adopting digital services to get their work done, a trend that has seen a big acceleration in the last year and the added intricacies that the coronavirus has brought to the working world.But within that trend, one of the last holdouts has been the small business owner, and specifically those that work in very “hands-on” areas like home services, with many of them using mobile phones but little else in the way of technology to advertise themselves or run their operations.That has seen a notable shift in the last year. Consumers are more than ever before using the internet to do business — whether that involves discovering companies or paying for goods and services — and tradespeople have found themselves also turning in that direction, not just to meet the changing demands of consumers, but also to keep themselves safe and in business. On top of that, the population of tradespeople themselves is getting younger and more digitally native, and they are adopting and using these tools more naturally than their predecessors.Jobber’s growth, said CEO Sam Pillar (who co-founded the company with Forrest Zeisler, CTO) in an interview, is “being driven by a number of factors, not just the ages of homeowners but also the providers of these services.” He added that many of the kinds of services that home services people provide — home repairs, our housekeeping, are not typically the kind that disappear with a pandemic.“Those two trends meant that home services professionals performed better than you would expect in the economy, and so did we,” Pillar said. “The younger generation of business owners starting or taking over companies are looking to figure out they will use to manage what is otherwise a mass of paper.” So offering them solutions that are user-friendly also makes a difference, he said. “Even if they are comfortable with technology, they are busy,” he added.Jobber’s funding comes as part of a bigger trend of startups building services for later adopters in the B2B world also getting a boost in their business — and attention from VCs.They include Hover, building technology and a wider set of tools for home repair people to source materials, make pricing and work estimates, and run the administration of their businesses, which secured $60 million in November. And GoSite in December raised $40 million for a platform to help all kinds of SMBs — the key factor being that many of them are coming online for the first time — build out and run their businesses.Hover secures $60M for 3D imaging to assess and fix propertiesThe connecting thread with all three is the fact that they are tapping not just into wider “digital transformation” trends, but that the need for their particular services has really come into focus especially in the last year.“We believe the home service category is in the early stages of a significant digital transformation – and Jobber is paving the way for thousands of small and mid-sized services businesses that are working to incorporate digital tools in order to keep pace with customer expectations,” said Colin Mistele, principal at Summit Partners, in a statement. “The Jobber team blends strong product vision, data-driven market perspective and a customer-centric approach – a powerful combination that we believe will support the company’s continued rapid growth. We are thrilled to partner with the Jobber team – and we are excited about the future of this category.” Mistele is joining the board with this round.The company is not disclosing its valuation and had raised just $16 million before this round.GoSite snags $40M to help SMBs bring their businesses online']",Drive Capital,"['NavigationClose', 'K', 'Lunden@ingridlunden', 'Getty ImagesOne', 'Summit Partners', 'OMERS Ventures and Version One Ventures', 'Tech Pioneers Fund', 'Jobber’s', 'Sam Pillar', 'Forrest Zeisler', 'CTO', 'Pillar', '3D', 'Colin Mistele', 'Summit Partners', 'Mistele', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

So Ramesh said it’s less about warning users away from certain businesses and more working “to continue to instill confidence in consumers to continue to connect with and support local businesses.”When users visit a business profile they’ll now be asked whether social distancing was enforced and whether the staff wore masks — Ramesh said other health and safety questions could be added in the future (and users can offer slightly more detailed feedback on safety measures by hitting the Edit button in a profile), but those are the ones that users seem to care about most.Image Credits: YelpWhen Yelp receives enough answers to present meaningful data (the company, understandably, isn’t disclosing the exact threshold), it will add a message in the health and safety section of the profile: “Social distancing\xa0enforced according to most users” with a green checkmark, or “Social distancing might not be enforced according to most users” with an orange question mark, with similar messages for mask-wearing.Yelp is making it easier for businesses to highlight their virtual servicesIn cases where the responses are mixed, but there’s still “significant” feedback indicating that these practices aren’t followed, the message will be attributed to “some users” instead.Ramesh said that Yelp has already been collecting this user feedback, and at launch, only “a couple hundred” of the millions of businesses on Yelp will be marked with an orange label, “which also means that many businesses are doing the right thing.”Image Credits: YelpHe noted that in cases of multi-location businesses, the health and safety data will be specific to each location. Also, the labels will be based on feedback from the past 28 days — so if a business gets an orange label but starts doing better, their profile should eventually be updated to reflect that.In addition, Yelp says it’s adding new service offerings and safety measures that businesses can include on their profiles, including checking staff for symptoms, disposable or contactless menus, heated outdoor seating and covered outdoor seating.Yelp adds new features for reopening businesses']",amassed over 400 million users in the country,"['NavigationClose', 'Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg / Getty ImagesMoving', 'Yelp’s', 'Akhil Kuduvalli Ramesh', 'Yelp', 'Yelp', 'Yelp', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'Ha1:00', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/KDZWyRoS30,2021-01-12T11:21:16,"IBM leads US patent list for 2020 as total numbers decline 1% in pandemic year to 352,000","['One year in, the COVID-19 global health pandemic continues to have something of a dragging effect on many aspects of life. But today, a key bellwether for how technology is developing underscored how the industry continues to march on. The number of patents granted in the U.S. in 2020 totaled 352,013, representing a decline of just under 1% compared to the year before (the final tally for 2019 was 354,428 patents granted).At the same time, patent applications rose almost 5% last year, a sign of how future years will likely see a boost in numbers again, according to figures from IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, which tracks applications and trends in patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. As with previous years, IBM led the pack in terms of number of patents granted in the year, but Samsung, in aggregate, continues to hold the most patents of any company.“Overall, U.S. patent activity was down slightly last year, despite the pandemic. This is a minor downward tick in what’s been a largely upward trajectory we’ve seen over the past decade, and it’s still 13 percent higher than what we saw in 2018,” said Mike Baycroft, CEO of IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, in a statement. “Another positive indicator is that published pre-grant applications saw a nominal increase in 2020. But we’ll have to wait at least another year before we can determine if the pandemic had any impact.”Patents, and lawsuits related to the infringing of them, have been part of a bigger theme for a number of years in the world of technology, with companies like Apple and Samsung, and Oracle and Google, using these against each other as an analogue for their larger commercial competition.While the heyday of employing those tactics appear to be mostly over, at least for the moment, patents still play a vital role as an indicator of the way that tech is developing: they point to the pace of innovation, who is taking the lead in that on a foundational basis, and what kinds of areas are driving the future of tech in a more general sense.US patents hit record 333,530 granted in 2019; IBM, Samsung (not the FAANGs) lead the packIn that regard, 2020’s numbers tell us that Samsung continues to keep a very wide margin when it comes to overall number of patents. The company now has 80,577 patents in total, up 5% more than in the year before. It has a very large margin still over the second-biggest patent holder. IBM currently holds 38,541 patents. To be sure, in terms of activity in the last year, IBM leads the pack still when it comes to the most patents secured in 2020, with 9,130 grants, although this declined 1% compared to a year ago. Samsung was granted 6,415 patents at number two, with Canon Inc., Microsoft, Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, LG Electronics, Apple, Huawei Technologies and Qualcomm making up the rest of the top-10 list.Amazon (number 11 at 2,244 patents), Google (17 with 1,817 patents) and Facebook (38 with 938 patents) also made the top 50 patent recipients this year.Technology trendsWhile the concept of patents has a long history that predates the rise of consumer electronics, they have seen an ineluctable shift away from physical systems and hardware, and toward the services that run on these, over time. In the last year, the top two most popular technology classes patented, IFI said, were electrical digital data processing and transmission of digital information — the generic names that underpin software and how information and data are stored and processed.Interestingly, IFI found that “computer systems based on biological models” was the fastest-growing technology on the list, up 67% last year compared to its growth between 2016 and 2020. The category points to the ongoing and huge interest in artificial intelligence, where areas like neural networking and other tech processes based on the mechanics of the human brain continue to be in hot demand, with\xa0Google, Microsoft and Intel all major patent winners in the area, IFI said. Alongside that aspect of AI, it said that machine learning, quantum computing, autonomous technology and 3D printing also saw big increases.As a point of comparison, last year medical and biological technologies figured very strongly, with areas like hybrid plant creation topping the list of trending technology, and CRISPR gene-editing and cancer therapies also figuring strongly. It’s interesting that in a year with a global health pandemic, and unprecedented medical research taking place in the race to find remedies and vaccines, we have seen little of that play out in patents granted, although I’m guessing the results would be different if considering what is being filed. It will be worth watching how this plays out in coming years, along with other trends that made themselves very prominent in the last year, such as e-commerce and cloud computing.\xa0Interestingly, despite the regulatory and public perception setbacks faced by companies like Juul, electrical smoking devices still saw an increase of 55% in terms of patents filed last year.

A final close is expected by Q2 2021.Its principal backer is the European Investment Fund, corporates and a number of Bulgarian tech founders and investors.With this new fund, LAUNCHub aims to invest in 25 startups in the next four years. The initial investment range will be between €500,000 and €2 million in verticals such as B2B SaaS, fintech, proptech, big data, AI, marketplaces and digital health. The fund will also actively invest in the Web 3.0 / Blockchain space, as it has done so since 2014.LAUNCHub has also achieved a 50:50 gender split in its team, with Irina Dimitrova being promoted to operating partner, and Raya Yunakova, who joins as an investor and previously worked for PiLabs in London, and Mirela Yordanova, who joins as an associate, previously led the startup community at Google for Startups Campus in London.The investor is mining a rich view of highly skilled developers in the CEE countries where there are approximately 1.3 developers for every 100 people in the workforce. “Central and Eastern Europe’s rapid economic growth has caught the attention of Western investors searching for the next unicorn. The region has huge and still untapped potential with more and more local success stories, paving the way for the next generation of CEE tech founders.” said Todor Breshkov, founding partner at LAUNCHub Ventures.LAUNCHub Ventures competes with other investors like Earlybird in the region, but they tend to invest at a later stage and is more typically a co-investor with LAUNCHub. Nearby Greece also features Greek funds such as Venture Friends and Marathon, but these tend to focus on their core country and diaspora entrepreneurs. Others include Speedinvest (usually focused on DACH) and Credo Ventures, more focused on the Czech Republic and CEE.LAUNCHub partner and co-founder Stephane Gantchev told me: “Our strategy is to be regional, not to focus specifically on Bulgaria — but to look at all the opportunities in the region of South-Eastern Europe.”LAUNCHub Ventures has backed companies including:Giraffe360 (Robotic camera for real estate listing automation, co-investment with Hoxton Ventures and HCVC)Fite (Premium direct to consumer digital livestreaming for sports, followed-on by Earlybird)GTMHub (The world’s leading and most intuitive OKR software, followed-on by CRV)FintechOS (Banking and Insurance middleware for automation and digital innovation acceleration, followed-on by Earlybird and OTB)Cleanshelf (Enterprise SaaS management and optimization platform, followed-on by Dawn Capital)Office RnD (Co-working and flexible office space management, followed-on by Flashpoint Ventures)Ferryhopper (Ferry ticketing platform for Southern Europe, co-investment with Metavallon)LAUNCHub Ventures closes its second fund at €18M, to invest in Eastern Europe']",Curve,"['NavigationClose', 'Butcher@mikebutcher / 10:37 AM', 'European VC', 'CEE', 'the European Investment Fund', 'AI', 'Irina Dimitrova', 'Raya Yunakova', 'PiLabs', 'Mirela Yordanova', 'CEE', 'CEE', 'Todor Breshkov', 'Venture Friends', 'Marathon', 'Speedinvest', 'Credo Ventures', 'CEE.LAUNCHub', 'Stephane Gantchev', 'Giraffe360 (Robotic', 'Hoxton Ventures', 'OKR', 'RnD', 'Ferry', 'Metavallon)LAUNCHub Ventures', 'Eastern EuropeclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'Venturesczech', 'Butcher10:37 AM', 'European VC', 'CEE', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/BYA8iTvGuS,2021-01-12T07:27:43,"Two ex-Sequoia VCs:  The most ‘compelling emerging market’ may be America, outside of Silicon Valley","['Roughly eight years ago, investors Mark Kvamme and Chris Olsen left Silicon Valley to open a venture firm, Drive Capital, in Columbus, Ohio. It wasn’t an easy decision. Leaving California wasn’t exactly fashionable at the time. In fact, While Olsen had grown up in Cincinnati, the Yale grad had landed at Sequoia Capital a couple of years out of college — a dream job — and had no interest in going anywhere. Meanwhile, Kvamme is a California native who attended UC Berkeley, grew up immersed in the world of startups (his dad was also a VC), and co-founded four companies before himself landing at Sequoia, where among his deals, he led the firm’s investment in LinkedIn.Even after a series of developments would lead them to take the leap, the early ride was bumpy. There was no venture community. Midwestern startups were still few and far between. Moreover, Kvamme, first lured to Ohio by his longtime friend John Kasich to take an economic development job that he thought would be temporary, was soon deemed a little too cozy with the state’s power players.Looking back now, it’s a wonder they stayed. Yet it’s because they did that Columbus is primed for more VCs to join them, they convincingly argue. Indeed, Drive, which now manages $1.2 billion and features nine investors, is receiving interest from 7,000 startups each year, and some of its portfolio companies are beginning to break out. The very first company to attract a check from Drive, an eight-year-old, Columbus-based hospital software maker called Olive AI, was assigned a $1.5 billion valuation just last month in a funding round led by Tiger Global. Another investment, in the five-year-old car insurance startup Root, also appears promising. Root, which went public in November, currently boasts a market cap of $4.7 billion, and Drive owns 26.6% of the company. (Olsen says it hasn’t sold a share.)We talked late last week with Kvamme and Olsen about what they are building — and why VCs who may be thinking about leaving California for Austin or Miami might pay more attention. You can hear that conversation in full here. In the meantime, following are some excerpts from our chat (edited lightly for length and clarity).TC: Everyone is threatening to ditch California. What’s the argument for heading to Columbus? How did Mark convince you to join him, Chris?CO: The early case that Mark made is: There’s an enormous amount of money that’s spent on research here. In Silicon Valley, the venture dollars ratio to research dollars is massively too many VC dollars for too little research; the opposite is true here in Ohio. This is more what Silicon Valley looked like in the late 1990s.At first, I was like, “Nope, not falling for it. There’s no way I’m believing that data. It’s a terrible idea” to move. But I was very much a numbers guy — still am — and when I started looking at the data, [I could see the] economy of Ohio is bigger than Turkey. The economy of the Midwest would be the fourth-biggest economy in the world. It’s bigger than Brazil. It’s bigger than Russia. It’s bigger than India. And it has this legacy educational infrastructure that’s been producing more engineers than any other corner of the planet. It was kind of like, wait a minute. If this thesis is right, maybe emerging markets are the most compelling place for venture capitalists to invest. But maybe the most compelling emerging market is America, just outside of Silicon Valley.TC: I imagine that you had your pick of companies when you first launched Drive. Is that true and has that changed in this new COVID era, when everybody is striking deals online? Who is showing up that you didn’t see a few years ago?CO: It might surprise you but we actually didn’t have our pick of the companies when we first got here, largely because it was unusual to be a venture capitalist. In Ohio, there just aren’t a lot of them. And so a lot of entrepreneurs were in non-obvious places. Unlike in Silicon Valley, where you have entrepreneurs sign up on this superhighway of capital, where you go from Y Combinator to the seed investor and then to the A investor, that infrastructure didn’t exist here. What was a little bit surprising to us was how much we ended up having to work to originate investment opportunities here in the Midwest, and not because people weren’t here, but because that kind of activity just hasn’t been built yet.We’ve had to spend a lot of time going into the universities and putting new seed managers in business and helping them fundraise and sort of building all of this infrastructure from scratch so that the next entrepreneur is out here [versus moves away], and it works. In our first year, we had inbound interest from 1,800 [startups], then it went to about 3,000 and now it’s up to about 7,000, which is more than I’ve heard any other venture firms say that they see in California. And I don’t think it’s because we’re great. I think that’s more [a reflection of the] scale of the opportunity that’s here now. One of the things that we would love to see more of is more venture capitalists coming here, because there’s certainly more opportunity than we can invest in.TC: You don’t worry that you’ve teed up the market for other VCs to come and steal your deals?MK: Not at all. I’m the old guy here, so I remember when Sequoia was started in 1972; my father worked with Don Valentine and National Semiconductor, and it was then Kleiner, Perkins, NEA, [just] a couple of firms. And what happens is you create this network effect. And the more capital, the more folks [who are building stuff in close proximity to you]. Right now, if we don’t invest in a Series A, there’s a couple of local folks, but primarily, [that capital has] got to come from the coasts.CO: My attitude is, ‘Come on [over] because the worst thing that is happening right now is that there are multibillion-dollar investments not getting made still because they’re based here. The problem that we have right now is [that] a Redpoint comes in and invests in one company in Ann Arbor, or Benchmark comes into this one company in Indianapolis, or Sequoia comes in [for a deal here or there] but they aren’t making this their primary business. And until we see more venture capitalists showing up here saying, “This is all I do every single day,” I fear that that next opportunity that we’re missing won’t get its funding. We’re just out of whack in terms of the number of opportunities versus the number of venture capitalists here . . .[Also] some of the very best investments in Silicon Valley are done with venture firms that can partner and then entrepreneurs have access to a larger Rolodex, a larger pool of capital, more diversity of thought — all the things that they need to grow their business.TC: You’re competing with other hotspots like Austin for attention. Make the case for Columbus specifically.MK: If you put a circle around Columbus, a one-day car drive, you’re talking about 60% of the GDP of America, over 50% or 60% of the population, and [access to] a huge percentage of all the top customers. Columbus is in the middle of it all. What we’re able to do then is easily travel to Chicago and Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati; it’s a quick flight to Minneapolis, and so on and so forth. And the Midwest is a spectacular place to build companies.TC: Drive’s team includes a director of engineering and several software engineers. Why?CO: One of the things you learn very quickly that’s different about the Midwest is, it’s not a city; it’s a nation. And you have to set up your infrastructure differently if you’re going to be successful investing into that nation [because] there’s just a lot of ground cover.One of the things that we have been able to do is to look at venture capital and say, ‘Look, there are a lot of rote, repetitive tasks that venture capitalists do, and what if we could eliminate those tasks, so that we don’t need to hire the boiler room of Ivy League grads to cold call the entire phone book and annoy all the entrepreneurs and do all that kind of stuff. We can do more homework in an automated fashion.’ So that was kind of the idea that we had. And so we built this software platform that we’re able to use now to not only identify which entrepreneurs have the highest probability of turning into an investment but also [who are] the people for our portfolio companies who have the highest probability of joining a certain startup, or, which venture capitalists have the highest probability of investing in that follow-on round of capital.TC: You had the chance to reinvent the VC model when you started your own firm. Are there any things that you did in setting up Drive that were different than what you’d experienced at Sequoia?MK: We were very fortunate to have worked at Sequoia. Sequoia is by far the best firm out there, in my opinion. And we often use the phrase, What would Sequoia do? And we built a lot of things around that. But we weren’t Sequoia, so there were many things that we had to do that Sequoia had maybe done 40 or 50 years ago but today doesn’t have to do. That includes building a lot of these capabilities Chris had mentioned before, building some of the infrastructure, helping lawyers understand how to do Series A term sheets or finding headhunters.We’re also not in a situation where everyone is coming into the office [unlike at Sequoia]; they see a lot of wonderful companies that just ring them up. That’s why we had to be very focused on our outbound efforts. So I’d say that 60% to 70% of what we’ve done we learned at Sequoia, but the rest we had to make specific to what we’re doing here at Drive.TC: How big a net are you casting geographically?CO: At this point, it’s massive. If you were to look at our portfolio, we have companies in Denver, Washington, Atlanta, Toronto, Austin. I think what we’re finding is that this opportunity is a broader phenomenon that we’re investing in.Before we will invest into any of these cities, we’ve had to go in the same way we did into Columbus. And we’ve had to meet with the landlords, because landlords out here are not built for startups. They’re built for legacy companies, and they want to see five years of trailing financials, and they want a massive security deposit. And it’s like, “Well, I don’t have that.” So too with the headhunters. There are phenomenal headhunters in Ohio. They’re totally different than the ones who are successful in Denver or in Atlanta because those talent networks are very localized.But now that we’ve done that and we’ve been invested in an infrastructure and we’ve got a density of companies in a lot of the cities that I just mentioned, now we can help and we can be very different from a venture firm that’s just going to zoom in for quarterly board meetings. We’ve got a partnership now that’s expanded where we’re investing people resources, and we’re in the cities on a weekly basis.']",account for 60% of its gross domestic product,"['NavigationClose ScreenTwo', 'Silicon ValleyConnie Loizos@cookie /', 'Mark Kvamme', 'Chris Olsen', 'Drive Capital', 'Olsen', 'Yale', 'Sequoia Capital', 'Kvamme', 'UC Berkeley', 'VC', 'Kvamme', 'John Kasich', 'Drive', 'Olive AI', 'Tiger Global', 'Root', 'Drive', 'Olsen', 'share.)We', 'Kvamme', 'Olsen', 'Mark', 'Mark', 'COVID', 'Don Valentine', 'National Semiconductor', 'Kleiner, Perkins', 'NEA', 'Benchmark', 'Rolodex', 'Austin', 'VC', 'Drive', 'Chris', 'Austin', '’ve', '’ve', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CapitalGecko', 'Silicon ValleyConnie', 'Mark Kvamme', 'Chris Olsen', 'Drive Capital', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/6nD8MHTk7r,2021-01-11T22:05:34,YouTube and WhatsApp inch closer to half a billion users in India,"['WhatsApp has enjoyed unrivaled reach in India for years. By mid-2019, the Facebook-owned app had amassed over 400 million users in the country. Its closest app rival at the time was YouTube, which, according to the company’s own statement and data from mobile insight firm App Annie, had about 260 million users in India then.Things have changed dramatically since.In the month of December, YouTube had 425 million monthly active users on Android phones and tablets in India, according to App Annie, the data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch. In comparison, WhatsApp had 422 million monthly active users on Android in India last month.Factoring in the traction both these apps have garnered on iOS devices, WhatsApp still assumes a lead in India with 459 million active users1, but YouTube is not too far behind with 452 million users.With China keeping its doors closed to U.S. tech giants, India emerged as the top market for Silicon Valley and Chinese companies looking to continue their growth in the last decade. India had about 50 million internet users in 2010, but it ended the decade with more than 600 million. Google and Facebook played their part to make this happen.In the last four years, both Google and Facebook have invested in ways to bring the internet to people who are offline in India, a country of nearly 1.4 billion people. Google kickstarted a project to bring Wi-Fi to 400 railway stations in the country and planned to extend this program to other public places. Facebook launched Free Basics in India, and then — after the program was banned in the country — it launched Express Wi-Fi.Both Google and Facebook, which identify India as their biggest market by users, have scaled down on their connectivity efforts in recent years after India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, took it upon himself to bring the country online. After he succeeded, both the companies bought multibillion-dollar\xa0stakes in his firm, Jio Platforms, which has amassed over 400 million subscribers.Jio Platforms’ cut-rate mobile data tariff has allowed hundreds of millions of people in India, where much of the online user base was previously too conscious about how much data they spent on the internet, to consume, worry-free, hours of content on YouTube and other video platforms in recent years. This growth might explain why Google is doubling down on short-video apps.The new figures shared with TechCrunch illustrate a number of other findings about the Indian market. Even as WhatsApp’s growth has slowed2 in India, it continues to enjoy an unprecedented loyalty among its users.More than 95% of WhatsApp’s monthly active users in India use the app each day, and nearly its entire user base checks the app at least once a week. In comparison, three-fourths of YouTube’s monthly active users in India are also its daily active users.The data also showed that Google’s eponymous app as well as Chrome — both of which, like YouTube, ship pre-installed3 on most Android smartphones — has also surpassed over 400 million monthly active users in India in recent months. Facebook’s app, in comparison, had about 325 million monthly active users in India last month.When asked for comment, a Google spokesperson pointed TechCrunch to a report from Comscore last year, which estimated that YouTube had about 325 million monthly unique users in India in May 2020.A separate report by research firm Media Partners Asia on Monday estimated that YouTube commanded 43% of the revenue generated in the online video market in India last year (about $1.4 billion). Disney+ Hotstar assumed 16% of the market, while Netflix had 14%.Google invests in Indian startups Glance and DailyHunt1 For simplicity, I have not factored in the traction WhatsApp Business and YouTube Kids apps have received in India. WhatsApp and YouTube also maintain apps on KaiOS, which powers JioPhone feature handsets in India. At last count — which was a long time ago — more than 40 million JioPhone handsets had shipped in India. TechCrunch could not determine the inroads any app has made on this platform. Additionally, the figures of YouTube on Android (phones and tablets) and iOS (iPhone and iPad) will likely have an overlap. The same is not true of WhatsApp, which restricts one phone number to one account. So if I have WhatsApp installed on an iPhone with my primary phone number, I can’t use WhatsApp with the same number on an Android phone — at least not concurrently.2 WhatsApp Business appears to be growing fine, having amassed over 50 million users in India. And some caveats from No. 1 also apply here.3 Users still have to engage with the app for App Annie and other mobile insight firms to count them as active. So while pre-installing the app provides Google an unprecedented distribution, their apps still have to win over users.']",Zipmex,"['YouTube', 'WhatsApp', 'NavigationClose', 'WhatsApp', 'YouTube', 'App Annie', 'YouTube', 'Android', 'App Annie', 'WhatsApp', 'Android', 'WhatsApp', 'YouTube', 'India’s', 'Mukesh Ambani', 'Jio Platforms', 'Jio Platforms’', 'YouTube', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp’s', 'YouTube', 'Google’s', 'Chrome', 'YouTube', 'Android', 'Comscore', 'YouTube', 'Media Partners Asia', 'YouTube', 'Hotstar', 'Netflix', 'WhatsApp Business', 'YouTube Kids', 'WhatsApp', 'YouTube', 'JioPhone', 'JioPhone', 'YouTube', 'Android', 'iPhone', 'iPad', 'WhatsApp', 'WhatsApp', 'iPhone', 'WhatsApp', 'Android', 'WhatsApp Business', 'App Annie', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAppsAsiaMediaMobileFacebookgoogle-chromeindiaWhatsAppYouTubeYouTube', 'WhatsApp', 'IndiaManish', 'YouTube', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The cause of her death has not been disclosed but internet users speculated that she had died from exhaustion.Posts with the hashtag #PinduoduoEmployeeSuddenDeath have accumulated 300 million views on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo. Separately, another Pinduoduo employee committed suicide on January 9 by jumping from his 27th-floor apartment. The local labor authorities are reported to be reviewing working conditions at Shanghai-based Pinduoduo.On Sunday, a former Pinduoduo employee spoke out against the firm’s stressful work culture in a video that went viral, adding to the public outcry against Alibaba’s biggest rival. He alleged that employees at Pinduoduo’s headquarters are required to work at least 300 hours a month (about 75 hours a week), whereas staff in the newly established grocery delivery department have a 380-hour minimum. The employee who fell on her way home worked on Pinduoduo’s grocery business in the Western province of Xinjiang.People with knowledge told TechCrunch that employees working on certain projects at Pinduoduo might work over 300 hours a month, though the hours aren’t mandatory. Companywide, staff are required to work from 11 AM to 8 PM.Pinduoduo cannot be immediately be reached for comment.The incredible rise of Pinduoduo, China’s newest force in e-commerceLong working hours aren’t unique to Pinduoduo in China. The string of incidents is reviving the debate around\xa0“996”, a term that denotes employees working from 9 AM to 9 PM, six days a week, though it can refer to any other form of demanding work regime in China’s cutthroat internet industry.Despite the public backlash and calls to boycott Pinduoduo, the company’s market position appears to remain firm. Its app downloads have remained stable since the first employee incident two weeks ago, with some days even seeing slight growth in installs, according to data analytics provider Jiguang. As of January 8, Pinduoduo had nearly 650 million installs.Its shares, traded in New York, climbed from $144 on December 28 to $187 on January 5 and dropped slightly to $174 on January 11. A few venture capital investors of Pinduoduo contacted by TechCrunch declined to comment for this story.The figures could be telling. Despite its efforts to attract more users in China’s wealthier cities, a substantial number of Pinduoduo users live in China’s low-tier cities and rural towns. The “996” culture of the megacity-based tech giants may be remote for them, while the deals on Pinduoduo, the e-commerce app famous for its “dirt cheap” goods, are tangible.']",Amazon,"['Jack Ma', 'Pinduoduo’s', 'TechCrunch', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Liao7:05 AM', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

For instance, you might be out and not have an internet connection, or you want to switch the card to be charged, so you can pay, and then later go back in time and change the accounts that were used. And then what transpired is that customers were using this feature because they wanted to free up cash in their checking account during COVID times. In March, many of our customers asked us to be able to ‘go back in time’ from the debit cards to their credit cards for transactions they’ve made in January and in December, 2019, and because they need to free more cash in their checking account.” He said it’s also led to a new product allowing customers to split payments into installments.If that’s the case, then Curve may be better able to weather the criticisms that have been leveled at companies like Klarna which potentially allow retail consumers to rack up debts.Curve also came under fire this month for failing to file its accounts with Companies House in London. But Bialick said this oversight is not material to the running of the business: “We missed the filing and the reason for that is because we had a very tight fundraising and we have limited resources so we had to prioritize it over something else. But we’re already in the process of submitting [the accounts] this week.”Bobby Aitkenhead, the managing partner of IDC Ventures, said: “Curve’s pioneering approach to finance is more necessary than ever as we accelerate globally to a digital-first world.”Rick Roberts, from Vulcan Capital, said: “Curve’s model is redefining the future of banking by bringing diverse financial products and solutions together into one digital wallet, for the benefit of banks and customers alike. Their friction-free offering is coming at the ideal time for American consumers, who are looking for safer payment options and greater financial control in the wake of the pandemic.”']",videos,"['TechCrunchOpen NavigationClose ScreenCurve', 'CurveCurve', 'IDC Ventures', 'Fuel Venture Capital', 'Vulcan Capital', 'Microsoft', 'Paul G.

https://t.co/fqI5PeKCpz,2021-01-12T02:00:01,BukuKas raises $10 million led by Sequoia Capital India to build an ‘end-to-end software stack’ for Indonesian SMEs,"['The backbone of Indonesia’s economy are small to medium-sized businesses, which account for 60% of its gross domestic product. Many still rely on manual bookkeeping, but the impact of COVID-19 has driven small businesses to digitize more of their operations. BukuKas, one of several startups helping SMEs go online, announced today it has raised a $10 million Series A led by Sequoia Capital India.BukuKas launched in December 2019 as a digital bookkeeping app, but is growing its range of services with the goal of creating an “end-to-end software stack” for small businesses. Eventually, it wants to launch an SME-focused digital bank.The funding, which brings BukuKas’ total raised so far to $22 million, included participation from returning investors Saison Capital, January Capital, Founderbank Capital, Cambium Grove, Endeavor Catalyst and Amrish Rau.As of November 2020, BukuKas had a registered user base of 3.5 million small merchants and retailers, and had crossed 1.8 million monthly active users. During that month, the platform also recorded $17.4 billion worth of transactions on an annualized basis, a figure corresponding to more than 1.5% of Indonesia’s $1.04 trillion GDP.BukuKas was founded by chief executive officer Krishnan Menon and chief operating officer Lorenzo Peracchione, who met eight years ago while working at Lazada Indonesia.Menon’s previous startup was Fabelio, an Indonesian online home furnishings store. Every two months, he would visit small cities in Indonesia, like Jepara and Cirebon, to source furniture.“One of the things that stood out was how different the Jakarta bubble is from the rest of Indonesia, all the way from the penetration of software to financial services,” he told TechCrunch. While talking to merchants and suppliers, Menon realized that “no one is building products with them as the center of the universe,” despite the fact that there are 56 million small businesses.Peracchione said he and Menon had been brainstorming startup ideas for a while. “When he told me about the idea of solving cash flow visibility to SMEs, it immediately struck me,” Peracchione said. “My dad used to be a SME owner himself and during my childhood I experienced firsthand the struggles and ups and downs connected to running a small business.”The two decided to start with digital bookkeeping after speaking to 1,052 merchants, because helping them keep track of their business performance would generate data that would in turn enable access to more financial services.“Our vision expanded into providing an end-to-end software stack to digitize SMEs and help them across a wide range of activities as a prequel to building an SME-focused digital bank down the line,” Menon said.In addition to digital ledger features, BukuKas also sends payment reminders to buyers through WhatsApp and automatically generates invoices, includes an inventory management module and analyzes expenses to help businesses understand what is impacting their profit. The company plans to add digital payments this month. During the rest of 2021, it will also introduce more features to help businesses sell online, including tools for online store fronts, a promotions engine and social sharing.“With COVID-19, SMEs are rushing to get digitized, but they lack the right mobile-first tools to sell online as well as to manage their business,” said Menon.The app focuses on smaller Indonesian cities and towns, since about 73% of the merchants who use BukuKas are located outside of tier 1 cities like Jakarta. Its users represent a wide range of sectors, including retailers, food vendors, grocery markets, mobile and phone credit providers, social commerce sellers, wholesalers and service providers. BukuKas acquired digital ledger app Catatan Keuangan Harian, which has 300,000 monthly active users, in September 2020 to expand its market share in Indonesia.With its large number of SMEs, Indonesia is seen as a desirable market for companies helping the drive toward digitization. For example, India’s Khatabook, which was valued between $275 million to $300 million after its last round of funding in May 2020, recently launched BukuUang in Indonesia. Other startups in the same space include Y Combinator-backed BukuWarung, Moka and Jurnal, all of which offer tools to help SMEs bring more of their operations online.India’s Khatabook raises $60 million to help merchants digitize bookkeeping and accept payments onlineMenon said BukuKas’ advantage is its team’s experience building businesses in Indonesia over the past seven years. For example, it launched a “Know Your Profits” module based on user feedback. It also offers a self-guided onboarding process, a simple user interface and an offline mode for users in areas with poor network connections.“In general, individual features can be copied but we believe our ‘integrated end-to-end software stack approach,’ coupled with our obsessive focus on simplicity, deep understanding of our users and a superior level of service will be key in differentiating BukuKas from competing offerings,” he added.BukuKas’ Series A will be used on user acquisition, its engineering and product teams in Jakarta and Bangalore and to introduce new services for merchants. The company may eventually expand into other Southeast Asia markets, but “in the short term consolidating and further expanding our leadership in the SME space in Indonesia is our top priority,” said Menon.Indonesian fintech startup BukuWarung gets new funding to add financial services for small merchants\xa0']",broke the news,"['BukuKas', 'Sequoia Capital India', 'NavigationClose ScreenBukuKas', 'Sequoia Capital India', 'Shu@catherineshu', 'BukuKas', 'BukuKas', 'Sequoia Capital India', 'BukuKas', 'BukuKas', 'Saison Capital', 'January Capital', 'Founderbank Capital', 'Endeavor Catalyst', 'Amrish Rau', 'BukuKas', 'Krishnan Menon', 'Lorenzo Peracchione', 'Fabelio', 'Menon', 'SME', 'Menon', 'BukuKas', 'WhatsApp', 'Menon', 'BukuKas', 'BukuKas', 'Catatan Keuangan Harian', 'BukuWarung', 'Moka', 'BukuKas', 'BukuKas', 'BukuKas', 'SME', 'Menon', 'BukuWarung', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAppsFundings &', 'Sequoia Capital India', 'COVID-19', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Any sellers that attempt to evade the company’s systems and list products will be subject to action, including a blanket selling ban across Amazon stores.News of the ban was first reported by The New York Times.The company is shutting down the nation’s newest favorite conspiracy theory by removing products sold by QAnon adherents from its platform after supporters were prominently on display at the riot in the nation’s Capitol last week.Amazon’s ban of Q-related products follows the company’s decision to remove Parler from its web servers and cloud services platform.The ban applies to any self-published books that promote QAnon or any clothing, posters, stickers, or other merchandise related to the Q conspiracy theory.Amazon has policies that prohibit products that “promote, incite, or glorify hate or violence toward any person or group,” the company said.A cursory search of the company’s platform on Monday revealed that the ban isn’t being applied to all of the Q-related products for sale.Seven pages of Q-related products were surfaced under the search for “WWG1WGA” an acronym for the Q-related phrase, “Where we go one, we go all.”The widely discredited Q conspiracy theory was born from a stew of different conspiracy theories that emerged from the 4chan message boards back in 2017.Since its emergence, the conspiracy theory has grabbed the attention of conservative activists, and its supporters were highly visible among the group of rioters that stormed the Capitol building last week — even as at least one Q-believer joined Congress the same week.A QAnon supporter is headed to CongressAmazon’s decision to ban the sale of Q-related goods comes many, many, many years after the movement was first linked to violence, as TechCrunch previously reported.Criminal acts committed by believers have included the fatal shooting a mob boss\xa0in Staten Island and blocking the Hoover Dam bridge in\xa0an armed standoff.The conspiracy’s followers have also interfered with legitimate child safety efforts by hijacking the hashtag #savethechildren, and exporting their extreme ideas into mainstream conversation under the guise of helping children.

https://t.co/yeLmZ4Kerx,2021-01-12T02:57:28,Sony reveals more details on its secretive Vision-S sedan,"['Sony’s Vision-S prototype sedan, one of the biggest surprises at CES last year, didn’t fade away after the tech trade show ended.The Vision-S is back in a series of new videos released by Sony during 2021 CES, which kicked off Monday. Two videos show the Vision-S prototype driving on a private track and then public roads in Austria. But it’s a third, longer video (included below) that sheds more light on how Sony designed and developed the prototype, its partners and some of the tech that’s under the hood.Image Credits: Sony/screenshotImportantly, the Vision-S prototype also appears to be just the starting point for Sony, according to Frank Klein, president of automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr, one of Sony’s partners on the project. Stein, who is interviewed in the nearly nine-minute video, suggests that Sony and Magna’s partnership will continue, comments that might help quash speculation that the prototype was a mere dalliance.The video, along with more information on its website, suggests that Sony and its numerous partners have been further developing the vehicle over the past year.Sony increased the number of sensors on the vehicle to 40 to allow for 360-degree awareness, and experimented with ways to increase their capabilities, according to Izumi Kawanishi, a senior vice president at the company who was featured in the video. Sony also created a system to verify the safety and security of its connected vehicle, he said.The dashboard-length display screen, shown below, has five playing card-sized tiles in the center labeled camera, settings, navigation, music and video.Image Credits: Sony/screenshotVideo footage suggests several other features that have been added, or are in development, including a voice assistant, gesture control, entertainment such as video games, the ability to update the car’s software wirelessly, 5G connectivity and a driver-monitoring system that uses an in-cabin camera. That camera, which Sony describes in more detail on its website, is particularly interesting.The camera is used to identify and recognize the condition of the occupant. If it detects a sleeping passenger in the back seat, the car will automatically control the climate around that seat to a suitable temperature, according to Sony. The system continues to evolve through everyday use, learning the driver’s preferred temperature and music and driving routes. Actual driving data is used to make the space even more comfortable, the company says.The video featured an array of partners on Vision-S, including Bosch and Continental, Hungarian automated driving startup AIMotive, software company Elektrobit Automotive, French automotive supplier Valeo, telecommunications giant Vodafone and German car parts maker ZF Group. The collection of partners, which also includes mapping company HERE, Nvidia and Blackberry/QNX and Qualcomm, leaves little doubt that someday there will be a Sony car that consumers can buy.“Getting closer to people is our corporate direction,” Kawanishi said in the video. “I think that mobility serves as a tool to achieve it.”']",Airbnb said it will take additional steps to beef up community protections for the DC metro area,"['Sony', 'Vision-S', 'NavigationClose', 'Vision-S', 'SonySony’s Vision-S', 'The Vision-S', 'Sony', 'Vision-S', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'the Vision-S', 'Sony', 'Frank Klein', 'Magna Steyr', 'Sony', 'Stein', 'Sony', 'Magna’s', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'Izumi Kawanishi', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'Sony', 'Vision-S', 'Bosch and Continental', 'AIMotive', 'Elektrobit Automotive', 'Valeo', 'Vodafone', 'ZF Group', 'Nvidia', 'Blackberry/QNX', 'Qualcomm', 'Sony', 'Kawanishi', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Vision-S', 'Vision-S', 'The Vision-S', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Today, at the (virtual) 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, the company formally introduced its upcoming products for the first time. The new line will include three MagSafe-compatible PopGrips, a wallet with an integrated grip and two mounts.The first of these is the new PopGrip for MagSafe, which will magnetically attach to MagSafe-compatible cases for iPhone 12 devices.The design of this PopGrip clears up some confusion over how a PopGrip (the round, poppable dongle that people normally think of when they think of “PopPockets”) will work with a MagSafe device. Instead of attaching just at the base of the grip itself, the grip is integrated into a larger base that attaches to the case.Image Credits: PopSocketsMeanwhile, the grip has a swappable top so you can change the style of your PopGrip whenever you want without having to buy a whole new accessory.This grip will also be compatible with PopSockets PopMount 2 phone mounts, including the new PopMount 2 for MagSafe, introduced today.The PopMount 2 for MagSafe will launch as two solutions: PopMount for MagSafe Multi-Surface and PopMount for MagSafe Car Vent. As described by their name, both products will magnetically attach to iPhone 12 devices either at home or while on-the-go.For those who use the new PopGrip for MagSafe grip, they’ll be able to leave the grip on, then let the mount’s magnets attach to the base.Image Credits: PopMount Multi Surface for MagSafeAlso new is an updated PopWallet+ for MagSafe, which is a combination wallet and grip that lets users carry up to three cards and now attaches magnetically to MagSafe-compatible phone cases for iPhone 12 devices. The wallet has an elastic sock so you can extract your cards without having to remove the wallet from the back of the device, and it now includes a shield to protect credit cards from magnetic damage. The grip here is swappable, too.Image Credits: PopSocketsImage Credits: PopWallet+ for MagSafeThere are also two versions of the PopGrip Slide becoming available. One, the PopGrip Slide Stretch will have expanding arms that attach mechanically to the sides of most phone cases, including iPhone 12 cases. You can slide this grip to the bottom of the phone to serve as a portrait stand or to attach MagSafe accessories, without having to remove the grip.Image Credits: PopGrip Slide Stretch for MagSafeThe PopGrip Slide for iPhone 12 is basically the same thing, but designed to fit the Apple Silicone cases for iPhone 12 devices, more specifically.Among the first of the new accessories to hit the market will be the PopGrip for MagSafe and PopWallet+ for MagSafe in spring 2021.The PopGrip Slide Stretch will launch March 21 on PopSockets.com and in select Target locations ahead of a broader rollout. The PopGrip Slide will launch May 1 on PopSockets.com and in Apple Stores. And the PopMount for MagSafe line will launch in summer 2021.The company also announced a few other non-MagSafe products, including the PopGrip Pocketable, which streamlines the grip when collapsed so the surface is flat; the PopGrip Antimicrobial, which has an embedded silver-based treatment for protection; and the PopSockets x SOG PopGrip Multi-Tool, made in collaboration with SOG Speciality Knives, which includes a PopGrip with a detachable multi-tool.The company didn’t share an exact time frame for these products besides “early 2021.”']",Dable,"['PopSockets', 'MagSafe', 'NavigationClose ScreenPopSockets', 'MagSafe', 'PopSockets', 'iPhone', 'PopGrips', 'PopGrip', 'MagSafe', 'PopGrip', 'PopGrip', 'PopGrip', 'PopSockets PopMount', 'PopMount 2', 'MagSafe', 'MagSafe', 'PopMount', 'MagSafe Multi-Surface', 'PopMount', 'PopGrip', 'MagSafe', 'PopMount Multi Surface', 'MagSafe', 'PopGrip Slide', 'MagSafe', 'PopGrip Slide Stretch', 'MagSafeThe PopGrip Slide', 'the Apple Silicone', 'PopGrip', 'MagSafe', 'MagSafe', 'PopGrip', 'PopSockets.com', 'Target', 'The PopGrip Slide', 'PopSockets.com', 'Apple Stores', 'PopMount', 'the PopGrip Pocketable', 'the PopGrip Antimicrobial', 'PopSockets', 'PopGrip Multi-Tool', 'PopGrip', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Promagnetmagsafemobile phonesPopSockets', 'MagSafe', 'PopSockets', 'iPhone', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Learn more: https://t.co/ltzutqpAgx #SonyCES pic.twitter.com/B0HpRGpSKF— Sony (@Sony) January 11, 2021At CES this week, the company’s finally prepared to show off a bit more. “Today, we’re going to introduce a product that integrates AI and robotics,” CEO Kenichiro Yoshida said in an announcement video, “designed for adventurous creators.”The drone is designed to carry Sony’s own imaging technology — specifically the Alpha series of mirrorless. And while it’s large compared to what we’re used to seeing on the consumer side from companies like DJI, Sony say it’s going to be the smallest drone on the market that can be equipped with its cameras.Along with the announcement, the company’s also debuting footage of the drone in action, along with video captured with its on-board camera. The drone was flown through snow and managed to capture some lovely, stable footage, all things considered. Also of note: The car in the video is the Vision-S concept the company unveiled this time last year.The system looks to compete with some of the more pro-focused models. DJI has that market under lock — along with practically all drone categories. Though while DJI owns a majority stake in Hasselblad, Sony’s system looks like a proprietary, purpose-built design. That could certainly be a bonus from the standpoint of compatibility, though it doesn’t seem like you’ll be able to swap the Alpha out for different cameras.The company is targeting a spring release for the system.

https://t.co/MRZzskYdk5,2021-01-12T00:32:14,"The Capitol riot and its aftermath makes the case for tech regulation more urgent, but no simpler","['Last week and throughout the weekend, technology companies took the historic step of deplatforming the president of the United States in the wake of a riot in which the US Capitol was stormed by a collection of white nationalists, QAnon supporters, and right wing activists.The decision to remove Donald Trump, his fundraising and moneymaking apparatus, and a large portion of his supporters from their digital homes because of their incitements to violence in the nation’s Capitol on January 6th and beyond, has led a chorus of voices to call for the regulation of the giant tech platforms.They argue that private companies shouldn’t have the sole power to erase the digital footprint of a sitting president.But there’s a reason why the legislative hearings in Congress, and the pressure from the president, have not created any new regulations. And there’s also a reason why — despite all of the protestations from the president and his supporters — no lawsuits have effectively been brought against the platforms for their decisions.The law, for now, is on their side.The First Amendment and freedom of speech (for platforms)Let’s start with the First Amendment. The protections of speech afforded to American citizens under the First Amendment only apply to government efforts to limit speech. While the protection of all speech is assumed as something enshrined in the foundations of American democracy, the founders appear to have only wanted to shield speech from government intrusions.That position makes sense if you’re a band of patriots trying to ensure that a monarch or dictator can’t abuse government power to silence its citizens or put its thumb on the lever in the marketplace of ideas.The thing is, that marketplace of ideas is always open, but publishers and platforms have the freedom to decide what they want to sell into it. Ben Franklin would never have published pro-monarchist sentiments on his printing presses, but he would probably have let Thomas Paine have free rein.So, the First Amendment doesn’t protect an individuals’ rights to access any platform and say whatever the hell they want. In fact, it protects businesses in many cases from having their freedom of speech violated by having the government force them to publish something they don’t want to on their platforms.Section 230 and platform liability\xa0BuT WhAt AbOUt SeCTiOn 230, one might ask (and if you do, you’re not alone)?Canceling conservative speech is hostile to the free speech foundation America was built on.There is no reason why social media organizations that pick & choose which speech they allow to be protected by the liability protections in 47 US Code Section 230.230 must be repealed— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) January 10, 2021Unfortunately, for Abbott and others who believe that repealing Section 230 would open the door for less suppression of speech by online platforms, they’re wrong.First, the cancellation of speech by businesses isn’t actually hostile to the foundation America was built on. If a group doesn’t like the way it’s being treated in one outlet, it can try and find another. Essentially, no one can force a newspaper to print their letter to the editor.Second, users’ speech isn’t what is protected under Section 230; it protects platforms from liability for that speech, which indirectly makes it safe for users to speak freely.Where things get complicated is in the difference between the letter to an editor in a newspaper and a tweet on Twitter, post on Facebook, or blog on Medium (or WordPress). And this is where U.S. Code Section 230 comes into play.Right now, Section 230 protects all of these social media companies from legal liability for the stuff that people publish on their platforms (unlike publishers). The gist of the law is that since these companies don’t actively edit what people post on the platforms, but merely provide a distribution channel for that content, then they can’t be held accountable for what’s in the posts.The companies argue that they’re exercising their own rights to freedom of speech through the algorithms they’ve developed to highlight certain pieces of information or entertainment, or in removing certain pieces of content. And their broad terms of service agreements also provide legal shields that allow them to act with a large degree of impunity.Repealing Section 230 would make platforms more restrictive rather than less restrictive about who gets to sell their ideas in the marketplace, because it would open up the tech companies to lawsuits over what they distribute across their platforms.One of the authors of the legislation, Senator Ron Wyden, thinks repeal is an existential threat to social media companies. “Were Twitter to lose the protections I wrote into law,\xa0within 24 hours its potential liabilities would be many multiples of its assets and its stock would be worthless,” Senator Wyden wrote back in 2018. “The same for Facebook and any other social media site. Boards of directors should have taken action long before now against CEOs who refuse to recognize this threat to their business.”Others believe that increased liability for content would actually be a powerful weapon to bring decorum to online discussions.\xa0As Joe Nocera argues in Bloomberg BusinessWeek today:“… I have come around to an idea that the right has been clamoring for — and which Trump tried unsuccessfully to get Congress to approve just weeks ago. Eliminate Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. That is the provision that shields social media companies from legal liability for the content they publish — or, for that matter, block.The right seems to believe that repealing Section 230 is some kind of deserved punishment for Twitter and Facebook for censoring conservative views. (This accusation doesn’t hold up upon scrutiny, but let’s leave that aside.) In fact, once the social media companies have to assume legal liability — not just for libel, but for inciting violence and so on — they will quickly change their algorithms to block anything remotely problematic. People would still be able to discuss politics, but they wouldn’t be able to hurl anti-Semitic slurs. Presidents and other officials could announce policies, but they wouldn’t be able to spin wild conspiracies.”Conservatives and liberals crowing for the removal of Section 230 protections may find that it would reinstitute a level of comity online, but the fringes will be even further marginalized. If you’re a free speech absolutist, that may or may not be the best course of action.What mechanisms can legislators use beyond repealing Section 230?\xa0Beyond the blunt instrument that is repealing Section 230, legislators could take other steps to mandate that platforms carry speech and continue to do business with certain kinds of people and platforms, however odious their views or users might be.Many of these steps are outlined\xa0in this piece from Daphne Keller on “Who do you sue?” from the Hoover Institution.Most of them hinge on some reinterpretation of older laws relating to commerce and the provision of services by utilities, or on the “must-carry” requirements put in place in the early days of 20th century broadcasting when radio and television were distributed over airways provided by the federal government.These older laws involve either designating internet platforms as “essential, unavoidable, and monopolistic services to which customers should be guaranteed access”; or treating the companies like the railroad industry and mandating\xa0compulsory access, requiring tech companies to accept all users and not modify any of their online speech.Other avenues could see lawmakers use variations on the laws designed to limit the power of channel owners to edit the content they carried — including things like the fairness doctrine from the broadcast days or net neutrality laws that are already set to be revisited under the Biden Administration.Keller notes that the existing body of laws “does not currently support must-carry claims against user-facing platforms like Facebook or YouTube, because Congress emphatically declined to extend it to them in the 1996 Telecommunications Act.”These protections are distinct from Section 230, but their removal would have similar, dramatic consequences on how social media companies, and tech platforms more broadly, operate.“[The] massive body of past and current federal communications law would be highly relevant,” Keller wrote. “For one thing, these laws provide the dominant and familiar model for US regulation of speech and communication intermediaries. Any serious proposal to legislate must-carry obligations would draw on this history. For another, and importantly for plaintiffs in today’s\xa0cases, these laws\xa0have been heavily litigated and are\xa0still\xa0being litigated today. They provide important precedent for weighing the speech rights of individual users against those of\xa0platforms.”The establishment of some of these “must-carry” mandates for platforms would go a long way toward circumventing or refuting platforms’ First Amendment claims, because some cases have already been decided against cable carriers in cases that could correspond to claims against platforms.This is really happening already so what could legislation look likeAt this point the hypothetical scenario that Keller sketched out in her essay, where private actors throughout the technical stack have excluded speech (although the legality of the speech is contested), has, in fact, happened.The question is whether the deplatforming of the president and services that were spreading potential calls to violence and sedition, is a one-off; or a new normal where tech companies will act increasingly to silence voices that they — or a significant portion of their user base — disagree with.Lawmakers in Europe, seeing the actions from U.S. companies over the last week, aren’t wasting any time in drafting their own responses and increasing their calls for more regulation.Europe seizes on social media’s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulationIn Europe, that regulation is coming in the form of the Digital Services Act, which we wrote about at the end of last year.On the content side, the Commission has chosen to limit the DSA’s regulation to speech that’s illegal (e.g., hate speech, terrorism propaganda, child sexual exploitation, etc.) — rather than\xa0trying to directly tackle fuzzier “legal but harmful” content (e.g., disinformation), as it seeks to avoid inflaming concerns about impacts on freedom of expression.Although a\xa0beefed up self-regulatory code on disinformation\xa0is coming next year, as part of a wider European Democracy Action Plan. And that (voluntary) code sounds like it will be heavily pushed by the Commission as a mitigation measure platforms can put toward fulfilling the DSA’s risk-related compliance requirements.EU lawmakers\xa0do also plan on regulating online political ads in time for the next pan-EU elections, under a separate instrument (to be proposed next year) and are continuing to push the Council and European parliament to adopt a 2018\xa0terrorism content takedown proposal\xa0(which will bring specific requirements in that specific area).Europe has also put in place rules for very large online platforms that have more stringent requirements around how they approach and disseminate content, but regulators on the continent are having a hard time enforcing htem.Keller believes that some of those European regulations could align with thinking about competition and First Amendment rights in the context of access to the “scarce” communication channels — those platforms whose size and scope mean that there are few competitive alternatives.Two approaches that Keller thinks would perhaps require the least regulatory lift and are perhaps the most tenable for platforms to pursue involve solutions that either push platforms to make room for “disfavored” speech, but tell them that they don’t have to promote it or give it any ranking.Under this solution, the platforms would be forced to carry the content, but could limit it. For instance, Facebook would be required to host any posts that don’t break the law, but it doesn’t have to promote them in any way — letting them sink below the stream of constantly updating content that moves across the platform.“On this model, a platform could maintain editorial control and enforce its Community Guidelines in its curated version, which most users would presumably prefer. But disfavored speakers would not be banished enitrely and could be found by other users who prefer an uncurated experience,” Keller writes. “Platforms could rank legal content but not remove it.”Perhaps the regulation that Keller is most bullish on is one that she calls the “magic APIs” scenario. Similar to the “unbundling” requirements from telecommunications companies, this regulation would force big tech companies to license their hard-to-duplicate resources to new market entrants. In the Facebook or Google context, this would mean requiring the companies open up access to their user generated content, and other companies could launch competing services with new user interfaces and content ranking and removal policies, Keller wrote.“Letting users choose among competing ‘flavors’ of today’s mega-platforms would solve some First Amendment problems by leaving platforms own editorial decisions undisturbed,” Keller writes.Imperfect solutions are better than none\xa0It’s clear to speech advocates on both the left and the right that having technology companies control what is and is not permissible on the world’s largest communications platforms is untenable and that better regulation is needed.When the venture capitalists who have funded these services — and whose politics lean toward the mercenarily libertarian — are calling for some sort of regulatory constraints on the power of the technology platforms they’ve created, it’s clear things have gone too far. Even if the actions of the platforms are entirely justified.However, in these instances, much of the speech that’s been taken down is clearly illegal. To the point that even free speech services like Parler have deleted posts from their service for inciting violence.The deplatforming of the president brings up the same points that were raised back in 2017 when Cloudflare, the service that stands out for being more tolerant of despicable speech than nearly any other platform, basically erased the Daily Stormer.“I know that Nazis are bad, the content [on The Daily Stormer] was so incredibly repulsive, it’s stomach turning how bad it is,” Prince said at the time. “But I do believe that the best way to battle bad speech is with good speech, I’m skeptical that censorship is the right scheme.“I’m worried the decision we made with respect to this one particular site is not particularly principled but neither was the decision that most tech companies made with respect to this site or other sites. It’s important that we know there is convention about how we create principles and how contraptions are regulated in the internet tech stack,” Prince continued.“We didn’t just wake up and make some capricious decision, but we could have and that’s terrifying. The internet is a really important resource for everyone, but there’s a very limited set of companies that control it and there’s such little accountability to us that it really is quite a dangerous thing.”']", pre-order from Noopl’s site,"['Capitol', 'NavigationClose', 'Capitol', 'Jack Dorsey', 'the United States?Jonathan', 'Justin Sullivan /', 'Erin Schaff - Pool / Getty Images', 'QAnon', 'Donald Trump', 'Capitol', 'Congress', 'Ben Franklin', 'Thomas Paine', 'Greg Abbott', 'WordPress', 'Ron Wyden', 'Wyden', 'Joe Nocera', 'Trump', 'Congress', 'Daphne Keller', 'the Hoover Institution', 'the Biden Administration', 'Keller', 'YouTube', 'Congress', 'Keller', 'Keller', 'Digital', 'Commission', 'European Democracy Action Plan', 'Commission', 'EU', 'Council', 'Keller', 'Keller', 'Community Guidelines', 'Keller', 'Keller', 'Keller', 'Keller', 'Parler', 'Cloudflare', 'the Daily Stormer', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy', 'AmendmenttrumpFeatured', 'Jonathan Shieber1:32 AM', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Metro Police. If the individuals have an Airbnb account, we take action, which includes banning them from using Airbnb.”That’s in addition to another sweep of existing reservations at locations around the Capitol in the days leading up to the inauguration to ensure that no one associated with hate groups slips through its dragnet.The company will also tighten up booking requirements, with additional identity verification measures and other security checks to ensure that background checks are up-to-date.As final steps, the company said that it is communicating with booking guests to inform them that if they’re bringing people who are associated with hate groups then they could face legal action from Airbnb.

https://t.co/2StbMH5Pgq,2021-01-12T00:00:20,Content discovery platform Dable closes $12 million Series C at $90 million valuation to accelerate its global expansion,"['Launched in South Korea five years ago, content discovery platform Dable now serves a total of six markets in Asia. Now it plans to speed up the pace of its expansion, with six new markets in the region planned for this year, before entering European countries and the United States. Dable announced today that it has raised a $12 million Series C at a valuation of $90 million, led by South Korean venture capital firm SV Investment. Other participants included KB Investment and K2 Investment, as well as returning investor Kakao Ventures, a subsidiary of Kakao Corporation, one of South Korea’s largest internet firms.Dable (the name is a combination of “data” and “able”) currently serves more than 2,500 media outlets in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. It has subsidiaries in Taiwan, which accounts for 70% of its overseas sales, and Indonesia.The Series C brings Dable’s total funding so far to $20.5 million. So far, the company has taken a gradual approach to international expansion, co-founder and chief executive officer Chaehyun Lee told TechCrunch, first entering one or two markets and then waiting for business there to stabilize. In 2021, however, it plans to use its Series C to speed up the pace of its expansion, launching in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, mainland China, Australia and Turkey before entering markets in Europe and the United States, too.The company’s goal is to become the “most utilized personalized recommendation platform in at last 30 countries by 2024.” Lee said it also has plans to transform into a media tech company by launching a content management system (CMS) next year.Dable currently claims an average annual sales growth rate since founding of more than 50%, and says it reached $27.5 million in sales in 2020, up from 63% the previous year. Each month, it has a total of 540 million unique users and recommends five billion pieces of content, resulting in more than 100 million clicks. Dable also says its average annual sales growth rate since founding is more than 50%, and in that 2020, it reached $27.5 million in sales, up 63% from the previous year.Before launching Dable, Lee and three other members of its founding team worked at RecoPick, a recommendation engine developer operated by SK Telecom subsidiary SK Planet. For media outlets, Dable offers two big data and machine learning-based products: Dable News to make personalized recommendations of content, including articles, to visitors, and Dable Native Ad, which draws on ad networks including Google, MSN and Kakao.A third product, called karamel.ai, is an ad-targeting solution for e-commerce platforms that also makes personalized product recommendations.Taboola and Outbrain call off their $850M mergerDable’s main rivals include Taboola and Outbrain, both of which are headquartered in New York (and recently called off a merger), but also do business in Asian markets, and Tokyo-based Popin, which also serves clients in Japan and Taiwan.Lee said Dable proves the competitiveness of its products by running A/B tests to compare the performance of competitors against Dable’s recommendations and see which one results in the most clickthroughs. It also does A/B testing to compare the performance of articles picked by editors against ones that were recommended by Dable’s algorithms.Dable also provides algorithms that allow clients more flexibility in what kind of personalized content they display, which is a selling point as media companies try to recover from the massive drop in ad spending precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Dable’s Related Articles algorithm is based on content that visitors have already viewed, while its Perused Article algorithm gauges how interested visitors are in certain articles based on metrics like how much time they spent reading them. It also has another algorithm that displays the most viewed articles based on gender and age groups.How will digital media survive the ad crash?']",phrase,"['Dable', 'NavigationClose', 'Dable', 'Dable', 'SV Investment', 'KB Investment', 'Kakao Ventures', 'Kakao Corporation', 'Dable', 'Chaehyun Lee', 'Lee', 'CMS', 'Lee', 'RecoPick', 'SK Telecom', 'SK Planet', 'Dable News', 'Google', 'MSN', 'Kakao', 'Lee', 'Dable', 'Dable', 'Dable’s', 'Dable’s Related Articles', 'Perused Article', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsMediaRecent FundingStartupsTCAsiacontent', 'Dable', 'Dable', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

The Sacramento-based company has designed an accessory that it says can help drown out background noise for users in a loud environment.The little accessory sports a Lightning plug (it’s currently iOS only), which connects to the bottom of an iPhone.

https://t.co/MgmkydRNhD,2021-01-11T22:05:34,YouTube and WhatsApp inch closer to half a billion users in India,"['WhatsApp has enjoyed unrivaled reach in India for years. By mid-2019, the Facebook-owned app had amassed over 400 million users in the country. Its closest app rival at the time was YouTube, which, according to the company’s own statement and data from mobile insight firm App Annie, had about 260 million users in India then.Things have changed dramatically since.In the month of December, YouTube had 425 million monthly active users on Android phones and tablets in India, according to App Annie, the data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch. In comparison, WhatsApp had 422 million monthly active users on Android in India last month.Factoring in the traction both these apps have garnered on iOS devices, WhatsApp still assumes a lead in India with 459 million active users1, but YouTube is not too far behind with 452 million users.With China keeping its doors closed to U.S. tech giants, India emerged as the top market for Silicon Valley and Chinese companies looking to continue their growth in the last decade. India had about 50 million internet users in 2010, but it ended the decade with more than 600 million. Google and Facebook played their part to make this happen.In the last four years, both Google and Facebook have invested in ways to bring the internet to people who are offline in India, a country of nearly 1.4 billion people. Google kickstarted a project to bring Wi-Fi to 400 railway stations in the country and planned to extend this program to other public places. Facebook launched Free Basics in India, and then — after the program was banned in the country — it launched Express Wi-Fi.Both Google and Facebook, which identify India as their biggest market by users, have scaled down on their connectivity efforts in recent years after India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, took it upon himself to bring the country online. After he succeeded, both the companies bought multibillion-dollar\xa0stakes in his firm, Jio Platforms, which has amassed over 400 million subscribers.Jio Platforms’ cut-rate mobile data tariff has allowed hundreds of millions of people in India, where much of the online user base was previously too conscious about how much data they spent on the internet, to consume, worry-free, hours of content on YouTube and other video platforms in recent years. This growth might explain why Google is doubling down on short-video apps.The new figures shared with TechCrunch illustrate a number of other findings about the Indian market. Even as WhatsApp’s growth has slowed2 in India, it continues to enjoy an unprecedented loyalty among its users.More than 95% of WhatsApp’s monthly active users in India use the app each day, and nearly its entire user base checks the app at least once a week. In comparison, three-fourths of YouTube’s monthly active users in India are also its daily active users.The data also showed that Google’s eponymous app as well as Chrome — both of which, like YouTube, ship pre-installed3 on most Android smartphones — has also surpassed over 400 million monthly active users in India in recent months. Facebook’s app, in comparison, had about 325 million monthly active users in India last month.When asked for comment, a Google spokesperson pointed TechCrunch to a report from Comscore last year, which estimated that YouTube had about 325 million monthly unique users in India in May 2020.A separate report by research firm Media Partners Asia on Monday estimated that YouTube commanded 43% of the revenue generated in the online video market in India last year (about $1.4 billion). Disney+ Hotstar assumed 16% of the market, while Netflix had 14%.Google invests in Indian startups Glance and DailyHunt1 For simplicity, I have not factored in the traction WhatsApp Business and YouTube Kids apps have received in India. WhatsApp and YouTube also maintain apps on KaiOS, which powers JioPhone feature handsets in India. At last count — which was a long time ago — more than 40 million JioPhone handsets had shipped in India. TechCrunch could not determine the inroads any app has made on this platform. Additionally, the figures of YouTube on Android (phones and tablets) and iOS (iPhone and iPad) will likely have an overlap. The same is not true of WhatsApp, which restricts one phone number to one account. So if I have WhatsApp installed on an iPhone with my primary phone number, I can’t use WhatsApp with the same number on an Android phone — at least not concurrently.2 WhatsApp Business appears to be growing fine, having amassed over 50 million users in India. And some caveats from No. 1 also apply here.3 Users still have to engage with the app for App Annie and other mobile insight firms to count them as active.

https://t.co/vEvveU9sMw,2021-01-11T22:04:04,Facebook says it will remove references to ‘stop the steal’ across its platform,"['In the wake of last week’s violence at the U.S. Capitol, Facebook today announced it will be taking additional steps to remove content referencing the phrase “stop the steal” on its platform. The phrase is associated with the right-wing campaign that falsely alleges the democratic U.S. elections have been rigged and aims to keep Trump in power by any means necessary, including, now, violent insurrection. Facebook had previously removed some of the original Stop the Steal groups in November, and says it has continued to remove Pages, groups and events that violate its policies, including calls for violence.As TechCrunch had previously reported, Facebook had also begun to block election conspiracy hashtags back in November 2020, including #sharpiegate and #stopthesteal. Searches for those would not return groups or posts, as a result.However, the cleanup effort was not as widespread or as ongoing as Facebook would have you believe. As of the time of writing, we’re aware of several active Facebook Groups that are still literally called “stop the steal,” for example.Facebook blocks hashtags for #sharpiegate, #stopthesteal election conspiraciesFacebook says its decision to take this further action has to do with the increased calls for violence in the U.S.“We’ve been allowing robust conversations related to the election outcome and that will continue,” explained Facebook in an announcement co-authored by Facebook VP of Integrity, Guy Rosen, and Monika Bickert, VP Global Policy Management. “But with continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the U.S. presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday’s violence in D.C., we’re taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration,” the blog post read.“It may take some time to scale up our enforcement of this new step but we have already removed a significant number of posts,” the authors noted.The company clearly wants to distance itself from being thought of as one of the platforms used by the organizers of the U.S. Capitol riot. In fact, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that the riot was “largely organized” on other internet services, not Facebook. She said that Facebook had taken down content from fringe groups, like QAnon, as well as Proud Boys and Stop the Steal groups, and anything that was talking about violence.Facebook is not the only mainstream social platform actively removing content that violates its terms as the ramifications of social media’s more permissive policies have now resulted in violent protests and an attempted coup, as well as people’s deaths.Several social media companies have also now removed Trump from their platforms, as Congress weighs impeachment for his incitement of violence. Meanwhile, the app stores and web services provider for the alternative social network Parler have also now given it the boot for the hate speech and calls for violence it hosted, as well.Facebook says it will continue to staff its Integrity Operations Center on a 24/7 basis at least through January 22 in order to monitor and respond to threats in real time. This time frame is likely because the FBI now is warning of plans for armed protests in all 50 state capitals and Washington in the days leading up to President-Elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20, according to a report this morning from the AP. This is why Facebook’s Integrity Operations Center will need to be highly available during these days.The Center had already been active ahead of Georgia’s runoff elections and Congress’s counting of the Electoral College votes. Its operations were extended due the Capitol protests, Facebook says.The company notes, too, it will continue to work with law enforcement to remove content, disable accounts and respond to legal requests for user data.The deplatforming of President Trump\xa0\xa0\xa0']",a short email to customers,"['NavigationClose ScreenFacebook', 'Trump', 'Steal', 'TechCrunch', 'Searches', 'Groups', 'Facebook VP of Integrity', 'Guy Rosen', 'Monika Bickert', 'Global Policy Management', 'Capitol', 'COO Sheryl Sandberg', 'Reuters', 'QAnon', 'Proud Boys', 'Steal', 'Trump', 'Congress', 'Parler', 'Integrity Operations Center', 'FBI', 'Joe Biden’s', 'AP', 'Facebook’s Integrity Operations Center', 'Center', 'Congress’s', 'Electoral College', 'Capitol', 'Facebook', 'Trump', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/hSa7rpCE7O,2021-01-11T21:41:25,Flexible VC: A new model for startups targeting profitability,"['David TetenContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tDavid Teten is founder of Versatile VC and writes periodically at teten.com and @dteten.\tMore posts by this contributor15 steps to fundraising a new VC or private equity fundFlexible VC: A new model for startups targeting profitabilityJamie FinneyContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tJamie Finney is a founding partner at Greater Colorado Venture Fund, where he blogs about his work on VC and small communities. \r\n\tMore posts by this contributor12 ‘flexible VCs’ who operate where equity meets revenue shareOf the Inc. 5000 companies, only 6.5% raised money from VCs and 7.7% raised from angels. Where else can fast-growing companies get funding?More and more startups are pursuing revenue-based VCs, but it’s not a good fit for everyone. A new category of investors has emerged offering a hybrid between VC and revenue-based investment (RBI), which we call “flexible VC.”From RBI, flexible VCs borrow the ability to reap meaningful returns without demanding founders build for an exit. From traditional equity VC, flexible VC borrows the option to pursue and reap the rewards of an outsized exit. Every flexible VC structure allows founders to access immediate risk capital while preserving exit, growth trajectory and ownership optionality. \n\t\t\tBefore raising capital, we encourage founders to dig into the nuances between different flexible VC structures.\t\t\t\t\tOur categorization is not a technical one. Rather, we want to accommodate the wide variety of instruments currently offered by flexible VC investors, detailed below. As two fund managers employing flexible VC, we think it is a healthy addition to the ecosystem and will yield more predictable and stable healthy returns for investors.Flexible VC 101: Equity meets revenue shareThis is currently the most common investment structure: The flexible VC investor purchases either equity ownership, or a convertible right to equity, and a right to regularly scheduled payments based on a percentage of revenues.By tying payments to actual revenues, founders and investors remain aligned around the company’s real-time performance, good or bad.“Too often, investment structures force the management team to make decisions between misaligned growth and investment (return) objectives. This structure allows for alignment on the front end, and real-time flexibility for performance metrics,” says Samira Salman, a family office investor and advisor.Payments are commonly delayed for a grace period of 12-36 months. John Berger, director of Operations and Impact Solutions at Toniic, observed that this has clear investor benefits: “The grace period became a feature because it benefits investors in regions like the U.S. where there can be tax differences between short- and long-term gains. It has moved from its origins as a tax benefit and can be viewed as a feature that benefits founders.” After the grace period, the return payments begin, often lasting until a return cap is hit, such as 2-5 times the original investment.To account for these revenue share payments, the investor’s ownership (or convertible right to ownership) is simultaneously reduced. Once the return cap is reached, the investor is typically left with a residual stake — a fraction of the pre-revenue share ownership. At any point, should the founder wish to pursue a traditional equity VC round, or get bought, the revenue share is paused, and the investor’s then-current ownership converts to equate to a traditional equity VC investor.Flexible VC 102: VariationsFlexible VCs have created structures based on other company performance metrics than revenues, such as profits or founder salaries. These different company performance metrics provide a slight variation in how the investor and founder relationship is defined. For example, profit-sharing structures ensure payments do not begin until the company is profitable, though likely delaying returns to the investor and complicating payment calculations.Similarly, when flexible VC structures are based off of the founder’s own compensation (often via salary or dividends), investors are specifically tying their returns to the financial success of the founder. This translates less directly to company performance compared to a revenue or profit share, but offers uniquely personal alignment. These variations in founder alignment allow flexible VCs to specialize in the types of companies they work with.The state of flexible VCIn all these cases, capital is provided to fuel forecasted growth without creating a commitment to a particular vision for future funding rounds, exit goals and associated blitzscaling. The founder retains full control over whether they want to optimize for hypergrowth (usually at the expense of profitability) or for organic, profitable growth. Flexible VC opens up a new risk capital option for bootstrappers, minorities, family-owned and countless other founder segments left out by the traditional funding landscape.A range of small VCs are deploying with flexible VC structures, but we believe the total amount of AUM deployed with this strategy is well under $50 million. Similar to the explosion of seed funds in the past decade, we (and some limited partners too) believe these Flexible VCs are on the forefront of what will become a major segment of the venture ecosystem.We detail below the major categories of VC:Funder categoryEquity ownershipReturns primarily based on\xa0Composition of returnsExample VCEquity VCYes, typically preferred equity.15%-20% sold per round. On average, founders own just 43% of equity by Series B, declining thereafter.The value ascribed by subsequent investors (in a secondary); buyers (acquisition); or the public markets (IPO).Volatile, uncapped.Andressen Horowitz, ff Venture Capital, HOF Capital, Sequoia.Flexible VC: Revenue-basedYes, nonvoting common shares (if converted).5%-20% initial stake, with 50%-90% of this redeemable.Gross revenues (generally 2%-8%).2x-5x return cap + path to uncapped equity returns.Capacity Capital, Greater Colorado Venture Fund, Indie.VC, Reformation Partners, UP Fund, Versatile VC.Flexible VC: Compensation-basedYes, via conversion rights at a valuation cap.“Founder earnings” (Founder salaries + dividends + retained earnings).2x-5x return cap + path to uncapped equity returns.Chisos.Flexible VC: Blended ReturnYes, via conversion rights at a valuation cap.Profits, founder salaries, and/or dividends declared.Typically ~3x+ return cap + path to uncapped equity returns. Discretionary dividends and salary share built in.Collab Capital, Earnest Capital, TinySeed.Revenue-share investingNo.Gross revenues (generally 2%-8%).1.35x-2.2x return cap.Novel Growth Partners, Lighter Capital, Rev Up, Corl.Flexible VC versus other venture capital modelsFlexible VC investors offer founders some of the same advantages as equity VCs:Aligned incentives.\xa0Whether it is a breakout success or complete failure and loss of capital, investors are along for the ride. When the company hits potholes, flexible VC investors usually don’t have the nuclear options of firing management and/or doing a recapitalization. Their only option is to work with management to try to fix the problems.Few strings attached.\xa0Founders have autonomy to spend the funds in whatever way they like.Long-term alignment.\xa0Many flexible VCs retain a small residual stake in the company after the return cap is reached, driving alignment well beyond the horizon of the revenue share, similar to the long-term orientation of equity VC.Seed-stage compatible. Like traditional equity VC investors, flexible VCs accommodate early-stage investment risk within their portfolios better than a traditional RBI funder.Eligible for favorable treatment under qualified small business stock exemption, if structured as equity. This applies if the investment converts into common stock; details are beyond this essay’s scope.Flexible VCs also offer investors some of the same advantages as RBI:Clear return expectations.\xa0The return cap is a stated multiple of the investment, typically 2x-5x.Early liquidity. Equity VC is a “get rich slow” business. Flexible VC creates early liquidity that can be either reinvested or distributed to LPs.Improved financial management. All parties want the company to be able to afford the payment obligations and, ideally, deliver a quick return. As a result, unfounded hockey-stick graphs and unicorn promises give way to financial fluency, realistic expectations, frank conversations about what a business can credibly achieve and transparency.Profitability is prioritized.\xa0The revenue that is going to grow the company immediately is the same revenue that is going to get investors to their return cap. If the company is profitable, the revenue share becomes increasingly affordable. This drives an earlier focus on profitability than is typical for a company backed by traditional equity VC.Founder retains control. Flexible VCs typically purchase nonvoting common stock, if they purchase stock (one even assigns their voting rights to the founders). This keeps the founder in the driver’s seat of the company.Attractive to women and underrepresented founders. See Why Are Revenue-Based Investors Investing in Women & Diverse Entrepreneurs?Flexible VC also offers some unique advantages:Straightforward equity interface.\xa0If an equity round is needed to fund breakout growth beyond what the flexible VC funds, the mechanics of including a flexible VC in an equity VC round are predetermined and simple.Prepared for blitzscaling, but neither required nor expected.\xa0Blitzscaling typically means prioritizing user growth over revenue growth and revenue growth over profitability. Tim O’Reilly, CEO, O’Reilly Media, argues, “Blitzscaling isn’t really a recipe for success but rather survivorship bias masquerading as a strategy.” With flexible VC, not every company is expected to achieve breakout growth, but that possibility is accounted for up front.Particular application in impact capital. Our research has found that impact investors appear to be particularly interested in flexible VC. An impact investor typically needs some economic return to function, but doesn’t necessarily want the company as a whole to exit, given exits often have a negative impact on the company’s founding mission. Flexible VC allows impact VCs to thread this needle.That said, nothing is cost-free.

https://t.co/Xh0hivUgCz,2021-01-11T21:30:52,"Sneaker enthusiast group SoleSavy raises $2M, setting the stage for a community-driven commerce boom","['SoleSavy, a community built around buying hot sneakers and related items that are increasingly hard to acquire at retail, raised $2 million in a round that closed late last year. SoleSavy is a group of communities that is currently mostly hosted on Slack.\xa0SoleSavy’s co-founders Dejan Pralica and Justin Dusanj founded the company in 2018 as a paid community for collectors and enthusiasts seeking pairs that were getting snapped up by bots or resellers. Pralica previously co-founded Kicks Deals, a sneaker shipping site focused on less than retail pricing and Dusanj is the former director of Operations at New Age Sports, a Nike retailer.\xa0SoleSavy’s $2 million party raise includes investment from Panache Ventures, Jason Calacanis’ LAUNCH, Turner Novak, Ben Narasin, Morning Brew’s Alex Lieberman and Austin Rief, Tiny Capital, Wesley Pentz (yes, Diplo), Matthew Hauri aka Yung Gravy, Ryan Holmes, Roham Gharegozlou and Bedrock Capital.SoleSavy has built an engaged community (several communities, really) around the ebb and flow of the sneakerhead consumer universe (SCU). I just coined that, by the way, please make it a thing. The SCU is an interesting place filled with fascinating characters and behaviors. Every once in a while it pokes its head into the mainstream, whether via a documentary, a hot shoe release or a strong-arm robbery attempt. In 2021, I believe that we will see more of this world breaking out of its box into the larger consumer consciousness.\xa0The trends that are leading us to this place are varied, but some of them have been front and center during the pandemic, as a decade’s worth of consumer behavioral change has occurred in the space of a few months. You only have to look at how hard it was to get a PS5 or Xbox One X or a GPU for the holiday season, and how many services, Twitter accounts and monitor groups rose up to try to help people do that to see what the future of shopping looks like.\xa0I joked about not being able to buy butter without a bot, but it’s not far from the truth — nearly every category of goods has had its own shortages over the last year. But the mother of all limited goods category for decades now has been sneakers.\xa0Every release is hotly anticipated and eagerly purchased by people looking for the latest shoe. The massive increase in interest in the sneaker as the marquee desirable item and the unwillingness of the biggest manufacturers to lose the hype halo has led to each drop being harder to get than the last. Second-market startups like StockX and GOAT have sprung up to facilitate those who don’t mind paying 30%-200% premiums on each release.\xa0The solution for many lies in the countless “cook groups” that help buyers anticipate demand and stock for each drop and plan to purchase them on release date.\xa0SoleSavy’s function is ostensibly to do just that: help regular enthusiasts to strategize and execute the release-day cop. But beyond that, Pralica says that the group has come to be about the community of people around those shoes more than the purchase itself.\xa0Image Credits: SoleSavySoleSavy is at its heart a Slack group (a series of groups actually that act as cohorts, leading people through the tiers of community that the team has built) with rooms that help people to understand what’s happening in sneakers, get the releases and commiserate around the culture. Pralica says that they’ve built that community out slowly (the waitlist for the group grows by 400 people per day) in order to maintain a positive atmosphere and to properly onboard new people to the group. They also have an app that drives push notifications and a podcast.\xa0That positive community vibe is what Pralica says is SoleSavy’s long-term focus and differentiating factor that keeps the 4,000 members across the U.S. and Canada interacting with the group on a nearly daily basis.I’ve been in a dozen or so different groups focused on buying large quantities of each release to re-sell over the years and many of them are, at best, rowdy and at worst toxic. That’s an environment that SoleSavy wanted to stay away from, says Pralica. Instead, SoleSavy tries to court those who want to buy and wear the shoes, trade them and yes, maybe even resell personal pairs eventually to obtain and wear another grail.Though cook groups have been the “core” of the Discord and Slack-based communities in the sneaker world, other iterations have been booming too. Entrepreneurial communities based in the same hustle principles like Tyler Blake’s In This Economy and fanbase-focused groups around popular streamers top the Disboard. And bets on social token outfits like Zora are also focused on community as the glue that holds together a user base.\xa0Crypto-driven marketplace Zora raises $2M to build a sustainable creator economyCommunity is the future of all commerce, whether you’re looking for a specific product (see the huge PS5 monitors) or want to steep yourself in a particular universe of product interest (the SCU). The trends that I’ve been seeing all point to 2021 being the year that community-driven purchasing breaks out of the underbelly of fandom and becomes officially “a thing.”Image Credits: SoleSavySoleSavy has been experimenting with a variety of ways to keep the community knit going, including live chats, get-togethers and even a handsome custom community-designed Jordan 1. These efforts have driven the previously bootstrapped company to some impressive early numbers. Pralica says that SoleSavy is currently profitable, with $1.5 million ARR on $33 monthly subscriptions plus affiliate revenue and that their DAUs are at 90% — an engagement number that would make any retailer salivate.\xa0Though the funding closed (very) late last year I thought that this would be a great kick-off story for the year ahead. Though SoleSavy seems to have a really compelling story and a great growth curve, I think they’re at the tip of a very large trend, one that we will see continue to build throughout the year.\xa0\xa0']",Saildrone,"['SoleSavy', 'NavigationClose ScreenSneaker', 'SoleSavy', 'SoleSavy', 'SoleSavy', 'Dejan Pralica', 'Justin Dusanj', 'Kicks Deals', 'Dusanj', 'Operations', 'Nike', 'SoleSavy', 'Panache Ventures', 'Jason Calacanis’ LAUNCH', 'Turner Novak', 'Ben Narasin', 'Morning Brew’s', 'Alex Lieberman', 'Austin Rief', 'Tiny Capital', 'Wesley Pentz', 'Diplo', 'Matthew Hauri', 'Yung Gravy', 'Ryan Holmes', 'Roham Gharegozlou', 'Bedrock Capital', 'SoleSavy', 'SCU', 'SCU', 'GPU', 'SoleSavy', 'Slack', 'SoleSavy', 'SoleSavy', 'SoleSavy', 'Discord', 'Tyler Blake’s', 'Disboard', 'Zora', 'Zora', 'SCU', 'SoleSavy', 'ARR', 'SoleSavy', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkCopy Share', 'FundingStartupsTCWearablesBedrock Capitalben', 'SoleSavy', 'SoleSavy', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/EpAM7169Cj,2021-01-11T20:22:21,Vuzix’s new microLED-powered smart glasses will arrive this summer,"['Less than a full day into CES 2021, and it seems that smart glasses are very much shaping up as a trend. I wrote about a pair of AR glasses from Lenovo aimed at business applications yesterday, and a few other companies have popped up in the meantime, with various levels of “smartness” included.Vuzix’s latest models are still several months away, but they seem to be one of the more promising we’ve seen at the show thus far. The company is best known for its business-focused solutions — that, after all, is where all the money is — at least until someone offers a really profound breakthrough in the consumer category.These probably aren’t that (if I had to guess, I’d look more closely at offerings from bigger consumer electronics companies), but they do seem like a step in the right direction, in terms of an offering that bakes augmented reality into a presentable form factor. It seems like AR glasses that look like regular eyeglasses is the right hook here. There are clearly differentiating factors here, but the next-gen glasses look a lot closer to standard eyewear than what we’ve seen in the past.That’s due in no small part to a partnership with Jade Bird Display, which will help commercialize the Chinese company’s microLED tech. Jade Bird describes it thusly:JBD offers active matrix inorganic microLED display chips and panels with wavelength ranging from UV to visible to IR. The pixel pitch ranges from 400 dpi to 10,000 dpi with a varity of resolutions.

It’s also a very costly and time-consuming activity, which can be demanding and dangerous for those involved. Saildrone is a startup focused on building out autonomous exploratory vessels that can do lots of mapping, while making very little impact on the environment in which they operate, and without requiring any crew on board at all.Saildrone’s newest robotic ocean explorer is the Surveyor, its largest vessel at 72-feet long. The Surveyor can spend up to 12 months at a stretch out at sea, and draws its power from wind (hence the large sail-like structure, which is not actually used like the sail on a sailboat) and the sun (via the solar panels dotting its above-water surfaces). Its sensor instrumentation includes sonar that can map down to 7,000 meters (around 22,000 feet). That’s not quite as deep as some of the deepest parts of the world’s oceans, but it’s plenty deep enough to cover the average depth of around 12,100 feet.As Saildrone notes, we’ve only actually mapped around 20% of the Earth’s oceans to date – meaning we know less about it than we do the surface of Mars or the Moon. Saildrone has already been contributing to better understanding this last great frontier with its 23-foot Explorer model, which has already accumulated 500,000 nautical miles of travel on its autonomous sea voyages. The larger vessel will help not only with seafloor mapping, but also with a new DNA sample collection effort using sensors developed the University of New Hampshire and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, to better understand the genetic makeup of various lifeforms that occupy the water column in more parts of the sea.']",expelled from AWS,"['NavigationClose ScreenSaildrone', 'Saildrone’s', 'Surveyor', 'Surveyor', 'Saildrone', 'Explorer', 'the University of New Hampshire', 'the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'New HampshireSaildrone', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/7OeNIWeJdp,2021-01-11T19:11:06,Mobileye is bringing its autonomous vehicle test fleets to at least four more cities in 2021,"['Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, is scaling up its autonomous vehicle program and plans to launch test fleets in at least four more cities over the next several months, including Detroit, Paris Shanghai and Tokyo.Mobileye president and CEO Amnon Shashua said Monday during the virtual 2021 CES tech trade show that if the company can receive regulatory approval it will also begin testing on public roads in New York City.The expansion announcement, along with details about a new lidar System on Chip product that is under development and will come to market in 2025, illustrates Mobileye’s ambitions to commercialize automated vehicle technology and bring it to the masses.The selection of the cities and countries is based on two factors: customers and the regulatory environment, according to Jack Weast, a senior principal engineer at Intel and the Vice President of Automated Vehicle Standards at Mobileye.“That’s why we put our cars in the U.S. in Detroit, rather than Silicon Valley because all major OEMs are in Detroit,” Weast said in an interview Monday, adding that Peugeot Renault are in Paris and Toyota and Nissan are in Japan. “The selection of the cities had a lot to do with putting the vehicles near our customers so that they would all have the opportunity to experience the technology firsthand because we expect our OEM customers to continue to be an important part of our business going forward even, even as we supply a complete self driving system.”A test fleet is already on the road in Detroit, according to the company. Mobileye launched its first test fleet in Jerusalem in 2018 and added one in Munich in 2020.Mobileye is taking a three-pronged strategy to developing and deploying automated vehicle technology that combines a full self-driving stack — that includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology— with its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy. Mobileye’s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into nearly 1 million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems. Shashua said Mobileye’s technology can now map the world automatically with nearly 8 million kilometers tracked daily and nearly 1 billion kilometers completed to date.\xa0This strategy will allow the company to efficiently launch and operate commercial robotaxi services as well as bring the technology to consumer passenger vehicles by 2025, Shashua said Monday.Mobileye has long dominated a specific niche in the automotive world as a developer of computer vision sensor systems that help prevent collisions. In 2018, the company expanded its focus beyond being a mere supplier to becoming a robotaxi operator; now it’s aiming to bring autonomous vehicle technology to passenger cars by augmenting its computer vision technology with the new lidar SoC it is developing with Intel.Mobileye has already partnered with Luminar to supply lidar for its robotaxis. However, Mobileye revealed more about the lidar SoC that it says will be ready for passenger vehicles by 2025. Shashua nor Weast would say if it planned to end its partnership with Luminar once its own lidar SoC is ready for the market.The lidar, which will use Intel’s specialized silicon photonics fab, is notable because\xa0Mobileye is known for its camera-based technology. And yet it’s not backing away from that camera-first approach. Shashua explained Mobileye believes the best technological and business approach is to develop a camera-first system and use the lidar and radar as add-ons for redundancy.“The idea is that you have this camera subsystem,” Shashua said. “Since it’s camera based, it’s at a consumer price level. So now you have scalable thinking. And this scalable thinking is really the cure for sustaining for a long time until level four becomes ubiquitous.”Shashua pointed to its long-term high-volume agreement for advanced driver-assistance systems with Geely Auto as an example of how a camera-first approach could later be adapted. The lidar and radar can be added on to support greater automation capabilities once the market is ready.']",previous range of $33 to $38 per share,"['NavigationClose', 'Intel', 'Amnon Shashua', 'Mobileye’s', 'Jack Weast', 'Intel', 'Automated Vehicle Standards', 'Mobileye', 'Peugeot Renault', 'Toyota', 'Nissan', 'Mobileye', 'REM', 'Responsibility-Sensitive Safety', 'Mobileye’s', 'ADAS', 'Shashua', 'Mobileye’s', 'Shashua', 'Mobileye', 'Intel', 'Mobileye', 'Mobileye', 'Shashua', 'Weast', 'Intel', 'Shashua', 'Mobileye', 'Shashua', 'Geely Auto', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Korosec8:11', 'Intel', 'Paris Sha...', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/NLZZGsGIoW,2021-01-11T19:09:10,"Healthvana’s digital COVID-19 vaccination records are about communication, not passports for the immune","['As the vaccination campaign to counter COVID-19 gets underway (albeit with a rocky start), a number of companies are attempting to support its rollout in a variety of ways. Healthvana, a health tech startup that began with a specific focus on providing patient information digitally for individuals living with HIV, is helping Los Angeles County roll out mobile vaccination records for COVID-19 using Apple’s Wallet technology. A cursory appraisal of the implementation of this tech might lead one to believe it’s about providing individuals with easy proof of vaccination — but the tech, and Healthvana, are focused on informing individuals to ensure they participate in their own healthcare programs, not providing an immunity pass.“I generally consider most of healthcare to look and feel like Windows 95,” Healthvana CEO and founder Ramin Bastani said. “We look and feel like Instagram. Why is that important? Because patients can engage in things they understand, it’s easier for them to communicate in the way they’re used to communicating, and that ends up leading them to better health outcomes.”Bastani points out that they began the company by focusing this approach to patient education and communication on HIV, and demonstrated that using their software led to patients being 7.4 times more likely to show up for their next follow-up appointment versus patients who received follow-up information and appointment notices via traditional methods. The company has built their tooling and their approach around not only producing better health for individuals, but also on reducing costs for healthcare providers by eliminating the need for a lot of the work that goes into clearing up misunderstandings, and essentially hounding patients to follow-up, which can significantly dig into clinician and care staff hours.Carbon Health raises $100 million with plans to expand pop-up clinics ahead of COVID-19 vaccination programs“We’re actually also reducing the cost to healthcare providers, because you don’t have 1,000 people calling you asking what are their results, and saying ‘I don’t understand, I can’t log in, I don’t know what it means to be SARS nonreactive,’ or all those things we address through simplicity,” Bastani said. “That’s made a huge difference. Overall, I think the key to all healthcare is going to be to be able to get patients to pay attention, and take action to things around their health.”That’s the goal of Healthvana’s partnership with LA County on COVID-19 immunization records, too — taking vitally important action to ensure the successful rollout of its vaccination program. All approved COVID-19 vaccines to date require a two-course treatment, including one initial inoculation followed by a booster to be administered sometime later. Keeping LA county residents informed about their COVID-19 inoculation, and when they’re due for a second dose, is the primary purpose of the partnership, and benefits from Healthvana’s experience in improving patient follow-up activities. But the app is also providing users with information about COVID-19 care, and, most usefully, prevention and ways to slow the spread.While Bastani stresses that Healthvana is, in the end, just “the last mile” for message delivery, and that there are many other layers involved in determining the right steps for proper care and prevention, the way in which they provide actionable info has already proven a big boon to one key measure: contact tracing. In select municipalities, Healthvana will also prompt users who’ve tested positive to anonymously notify close contacts directly from their device, which will provide those individuals with both free testing options and information resources.Apple and Google release sample code, UI and detailed policies for COVID-19 exposure-notification apps“Just us doing this in the greater Los Angeles area for less than two months, 12,000+ people have been notified that they’ve been exposed,” Bastani said. “Each of them likely lives with other people and families — this is how you can help slow the spread.”Contrast that with the relatively slow uptake of the exposure notification tools built into iOS and Android devices via recent software updates provided by Google and Apple working in a rare collaboration. While the technology that underlies it is sound, and focused on user privacy, its usage numbers thus far are far from earthshaking; only 388 people have sent alerts through Virginia’s app-based on the exposure notification framework in three months since its launch, for instance.Healthvana’s focus on timely and relevant delivery of information, offered to users in ways they’re mostly likely to understand and engage with, is already showing its ability to have an impact on COVID-19 and its community transmission. The startup is already in talks to launch similar programs elsewhere in the country, and that could help improve national vaccination outcomes, and how people handle COVID-19 once they have it, too.']",Facebook announced today,"['Healthvana', 'NavigationClose', 'COVID-19', 'Healthvana', 'COVID-19', 'Apple’s Wallet', 'Healthvana', 'Healthvana', 'Ramin Bastani', 'Bastani', 'Healthvana’s', 'COVID-19', 'Healthvana', 'Bastani', 'Healthvana', 'Healthvana', 'Apple', 'UI', 'Bastani', 'Android', 'Google', 'Apple', 'COVID-19', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'SciencesLos AngelesHealthvana’s', 'COVID-19', 'Healthvana', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/smWrCk5xdm,2021-01-11T19:08:43,"Following riots, alternative social apps and private messengers top the app stores","['Alternative social media apps, including MeWe, CloutHub and other privacy-focused rivals to big tech, are topping the app stores following Trump’s ban from mainstream social platforms like Facebook and Twitter and the more recent removal of conservative social app Parler from both the App Store and Google Play. In the days since the Parler ban, “free speech”-favoring social networks are seeing notable numbers of new downloads at a quick pace, data shows.Next-generation social network MeWe, founded in May 2012 as a beta, then launched in 2016, is one of those that’s seeing the largest bump in new installs.The app has been steadily growing in the days since the U.S. presidential election and the related increases in moderation of misinformation by larger platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Mainstream social networks enforced their policies and even created new ones to moderate content shared by Trump and his allies — including their baseless claims of election fraud that have not be substantiated by U.S. courts, despite dozens of lawsuits.To date, MeWe has seen over 16 million global lifetime installs, according to data from app intelligence firm Apptopia. However, since Wednesday of last week, the app has been downloaded nearly 200,000 times worldwide. A majority of those new downloads are coming from U.S. users, who accounted for nearly 143,000 installs.Largely, those users came to MeWe following Parler’s ban from app stores. Apple gave Parler the boot late on Saturday, and MeWe popped in the charts as a result. Saturday through Sunday alone, MeWe gained 110,200+ new installs in the U.S.Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly loomsThe company told us it has seen 1 million new members sign up in the last 72 hours and now adds over 20,000 new members per hour.Because app stores’ Top Charts reflect not just total downloads but also the velocity of those new installs, MeWe has gained a position in the top 10 very quickly due to recent trends.As of Sunday, MeWe ranked No. 7 in the U.S. App Store’s Top Overall free charts. It’s already moving up today.This is remarkable growth for the alternative social app, given that as recently as October the app was not ranked on the App Store’s Top Charts at all. (Being unranked means that the app is so far down on the charts, it’s lower than rank No. 1,500 — so its rank is basically untrackable.) MeWe did, however, chart in the Social Networking category at some points during this time.Image Credits: App Store screenshotAnother app benefitting from recent events, including the Parler ban, is the relative newcomer CloutHub.The app was launched in January 2019 and claims to be a social network for “social, civic, and political networking” with a free speech angle. Its website says it wants to give “everyone a platform to have their voice heard.”Apple suspends Parler from App StoreTo date, CloutHub has seen just 255,000 total lifetime installs, but 31,000+ of these have come over the past week — or more specifically, since Wednesday. (CloutHub may be struggling with the surge of new users, as we found sign-ups and logins are often timing out.) The app as of now ranks No. 11 on the U.S. App Store.Image Credits: App Store screenshotTwo other apps that have moved into the top charts are cases of mistaken identity.As Mashable recently reported, an app called “Parlor” is being mistaken for the now-banned “Parler” app. Its report cited Sensor Tower data that said “Parlor” has seen as many as 40,000 downloads in December alone.Apptopia says the social chat app, founded in May 2011, has seen 8.6 million lifetime global installs. But from Wednesday through Sunday, it gained 115,846 new users — many who were likely looking for “Parler.” Of those, 99,220+ arrived on either Saturday or Sunday, just as the Parler ban was beginning to roll out. Even though Apple didn’t take action on Parler until later on Saturday, users may have come across “Parlor” by searching for it by this alternative spelling.As of Sunday, “Parlor” became the No. 4 Top App Overall on iOS in the U.S.Meanwhile, an app called “Gab News” — which is actually just a local news app for the Georgetown area — is also gaining ground. This is because it’s mistaken for the long since banned app “Gab,” which ex-Parler users are suggesting as an alternative. Apple had declined to host Gab back in 2016, citing its pornographic content and later, due to its policies against hosting apps that include hate speech. Though Gab was able to launch on Google Play in 2017, the app was quickly removed from there as well, also for hate speech.“Gab News,” however, is currently ranking No. 44 on the App Store’s Top Free Apps Chart in the U.S., as of the time of writing. (Download data was not immediately available.)Then there is Rumble, a conservative alternative to YouTube. The app has gained 2.4 million total global installs since its January 2020 launch, per Apptopia’s estimates. Since Wednesday, that included 91,916 new downloads, 73,700+ of which were in the U.S. It has also climbed to No. 78 on the U.S. App Store, up from No. 1,484 on December 19, 2020.The Parler ban is not the only thing triggering these shifts, to be clear.Image Credits: Google Play screenshotThere’s also a general backlash underway against big tech, which many on both sides feel has become too powerful.Governments have been examining the business models and practices of companies like Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook over the past year in markets around the world with an eye on antitrust action. Facebook and Google are also being scrutinized by users for their privacy practices — especially as Apple is now forcing companies to add privacy labels to all apps that disclose what they do with user data.From the US to China, Korea, India and Europe, antitrust action against tech is gaining serious momentumAs a result, some people were turning to alternative networking apps not just because they’re conservative, but because they value privacy. (More recently, some privacy-minded consumers became aware of WhatsApp’s data-sharing practices due to a notification, but they are not new.) As a result of this broader shift to private platforms combined with recent events, encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Telegram are booming, as is the privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo, a Google.com alternative.These apps have also picked up steam over the past week. Signal is now No. 1 on the U.S. App Store, Telegram is No. 2 and DuckDuckGo is No. 8. This is rapid growth. Around mid-October 2020, these apps were ranked No. 618, 79, and 715, respectively, Apptopia says. DuckDuckGo also told us it’s seen 62% year-over-year growth between 2019 and 2020 and has become the No. 2 search engine in the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia.That said, it’s also worth noting that some users may be seeking private messaging platforms in the wake of the U.S. Capitol riots, now that the FBI has begun to arrest insurgents. Signal has gained nearly 325,000 new installs since Thursday and Telegram gained 330,600+, for example.This rapid shift to alternative social and messaging networks is an indication of how difficult it may be in the weeks ahead for app stores to enforce their policies. Though the platforms typically crack down on apps hosting hate speech and those allowing incitement of violence, they tend to move more slowly than the crowd downloading the next alternative app.In the meantime, the apps that become popular may struggle with moderation. We’ve already come across examples of both extreme hate speech and calls for assassination on MeWe, for instance, even though the company says it investigates and removes this sort of content, per its Terms of Service.It’s unclear what the future for these free speech, alternative apps may hold, as platform providers such as Amazon (AWS) are now also declining to host them, and payment providers, like Stripe, which just cut ties with the Trump campaign, may decline to process future online payments. That could leave the networks to ultimately scramble for private funding to build their own infrastructure and stay afloat, as well as to seek out alternative distribution systems, like the web or even sideloading, to reach their users.Parler is officially offline after AWS suspension\xa0\xa0\xa0']",SuperCharger Ventures,"['NavigationClose ScreenFollowing', 'CloutHub', 'Trump’s', 'Parler', 'the App Store', 'Parler', 'Trump', 'MeWe', 'Parler’s', 'Apple', 'Parler', 'U.S.Parler', 'Apple', 'MeWe', 'the App Store’s Top Charts', 'Social Networking', 'App Store', 'Parler', 'CloutHub', 'Parler', 'App StoreTo', 'CloutHub', 'CloutHub', 'the U.S. App Store', 'Apptopia', 'Parler', 'Apple', 'Parler', 'U.S.Meanwhile', 'Georgetown', 'Gab', 'Apple', 'Gab', 'Gab', 'the App Store’s Top Free Apps Chart', 'Download', 'YouTube', 'Apptopia’s', 'the U.S. App Store', 'Parler', 'Apple', 'Google', 'Amazon', 'Apple', 'WhatsApp’s', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'Google.com', 'Signal', 'the U.S. App Store', 'Apptopia', 'FBI', 'Signal', 'Telegram', 'Terms of Service', 'Amazon', 'Stripe', 'Trump', 'Parler', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CloutHub', 'Trump’s', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/mHGWKPb2C7,2021-01-11T18:48:09,"Parler sues Amazon, leveling far-fetched antitrust allegations","['Parler has sued Amazon after the beleaguered conservative social media site was expelled from AWS, filing a fanciful complaint alleging the internet giant took it out for political reasons — and in an antitrust conspiracy to benefit Twitter. But its own allegations, including breach of contract, are belied by evidence they supply alongside the suit.In the lawsuit, filed today in the U.S. Western District Court, Parler complains that “AWS’s decision to effectively terminate Parler’s account is apparently motivated by political animus. It is also apparently designed to reduce competition in the microblogging services market to the benefit of Twitter.”Amazon Web Services gives Parler 24-hour notice that it will suspend services to the companyRegarding the “political animus,” it is difficult to speak to Parler’s reasoning, since that argument is supported nowhere in the suit — it simply is never referred to again.There is the suggestion that Amazon has shown more tolerance for offending content on Twitter than on Parler, but this isn’t well substantiated. For instance, the suit notes that “Hang Mike Pence” trended on Friday the 8th, without noting that much of this volume was, as any user of Twitter can see by searching, people decrying this phrase as having been chanted by the rioters in the Capitol two days prior.By way of contrast, one Parler post cited by Amazon says that “we need to start systematicly [sic] assasinating [sic] #liberal leaders, liberal activists, #blm leaders and supporters,” and so on. As TechCrunch has been monitoring Parler conversations, we can say that this is far from an isolated example of this rhetoric.Parler reportedly removed posts by Trump affiliate Lin Wood calling for execution of VP Mike PenceThe antitrust argument suggests a conspiracy by Amazon to protect and advance the interests of Twitter. Specifically, the argument is that because Twitter is a major customer of AWS, and Parler is a threat to Twitter, Amazon wanted to take Parler out of the picture.Given the context of Parler’s looming threat to Twitter and the fact that the Twitter ban might not long muzzle the President if he switched to Parler, potentially bringing tens of millions of followers with him, AWS moved to shut down Parler.This argument is not convincing for several reasons, but the most obvious one is that Parler was at the time also an AWS customer. If people are going from one customer to another, why would Amazon care at all, let alone enough to interfere to the point of legal and ethical dubiety?The lawsuit also accuses Amazon of leaking the email communicating Parler’s imminent suspension to reporters before it was sent to administrators at the site. (It also says that Amazon “sought to defame” Parler, though defamation is not part of the legal complaint. Parler seems to be using this term rather loosely.)The deplatforming of President TrumpLastly Parler says Amazon is in breach of contract, having not given the 30 days warning stipulated in the terms of service. The exception is if a “material breach remains uncured for a period of 30 days” after notice. As Parler explains it:On January 8, 2021, AWS brought concerns to Parler about user content that encouraged violence. Parler addressed them, and then AWS said it was “okay” with Parler.The next day, January 9, 2021, AWS brought more “bad” content to Parler and Parler took down all of that content by the evening.Thus, there was no uncured material breach of the Agreement for 30 days, as required for termination.But in the email attached as evidence to the lawsuit — literally exhibit A — Amazon makes it clear the issues have been ongoing for longer than that (emphasis added):Over the past several weeks, we’ve reported 98 examples to Parler of posts that clearly encourage and incite violence… You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency… It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.You can read the rest of the letter here, but it’s obvious that Amazon is not simply saying that a few days of violations are the cause of Parler’s being kicked off the service.Parler asks a judge for a Temporary Restraining Order that would restore its access to AWS while the rest of the case is argued, and for damages to be specified at trial.Update: Amazon has provided the following statement regarding the lawsuit:There is no merit to these claims. AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow. However, it is clear that there is significant content on Parler that encourages and incites violence against others, and that Parler is unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which is a violation of our terms of service. We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening.You can read the full complaint below.Parler v Amazon by TechCrunchScraped Parler data is a metadata goldmine\xa0']",,"['Amazon', 'NavigationClose', 'Amazon', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Amazon', 'Western District Court', 'Parler', 'Parler’s', 'Parler', 'Parler’s', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Trump', 'Lin Wood', 'Mike PenceThe', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Parler’s', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Amazon', 'Parler’s', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Parler’s', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Parler’s', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'ServicesCapitol RiotparlerParler', 'Amazon', 'Coldewey7:48', 'Amazon', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.As TechCrunch wrote when Affirm first affixed a price range to its IPO, the fintech unicorn will be worth a multiple of its final private price. The company was valued at around $2.9 billion in a 2019 round and raised more capital at a higher $19.93 per-share price in September of 2020; the company’s IPO price range is now more than double what the company was worth less than half a year ago.Let’s calculate Affirm’s new simple and diluted new valuation ranges, and contrast those with its recent revenues to get a handle regarding how close to software numbers the startup can get its revenue multiple.Inside the mathVery little has changed in Affirm’s S-1 filings when it comes to share counts.

Austin is set to start on January 19 and will be based in Washington, DC.Austin most recently served as a civil rights lawyer at Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP. Prior to that, Austin co-authored a report on big data and civil rights and worked with President Barack Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.“I am excited to join Facebook at this moment when there is a national and global awakening happening around civil rights,” Austin said in a statement.Roy Austin, Facebook’s new VP of Civil Rights. Image Credits: Facebook\xa0“Technology plays a role in nearly every part of our lives, and it’s important that it be used to overcome the historic discrimination and hate which so many underrepresented groups have faced, rather than to exacerbate it. I could not pass up the opportunity to join a company whose products are used by so many and which impacts the civil rights and liberties of billions of people, in order to help steer a better way forward.”It’s not clear what the goals or responsibilities of the civil rights organization within Facebook will be, but we’ve reached out to Facebook for more information. In the meantime, here’s what Facebook’s Chief General Counsel Jennifer Newstead said on the company blog:I am delighted to welcome Roy to Facebook as our VP of Civil Rights. Roy has proved throughout his career that he is a passionate and principled advocate for civil rights — whether it is in the courtroom or the White House. I know he will bring the same wisdom, integrity and dedication to Facebook. It’s hard to imagine anyone better qualified to help us strengthen and advance civil rights on our platform and in our company.In July, former ACLU director Laura W. Murphy released the results of the multiyear investigation and civil rights audit of Facebook. The report highlights some progress, such as Facebook changing its policy on discriminatory housing and employment ads, expanding its voter suppression policies and having more frequent meetings with civil rights leaders. But the auditors still raised a number of concerns, many of which pertained to the 2020 U.S. election and President Trump.In light of a pro-Trump mob storming the U.S. Capitol last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg blocked Trump from both Facebook and Instagram at least through the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.Blistering civil rights audit raises alarms about Facebook’s ongoing policy failures']",BMW,"['NavigationClose ScreenFacebook', 'Rose Dickey@meganrosedickey / 7:29 PM GMT+1•January 11', 'NurPhoto', 'Getty ImagesFacebook', 'Roy Austin', 'Austin', 'Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP', 'Austin', 'Barack Obama’s', 'Austin', 'Roy Austin', 'Facebook’s', 'VP of Civil Rights', 'Counsel Jennifer Newstead', 'Roy', 'Roy', 'the White House', 'ACLU', 'Laura W.

https://t.co/mDoiK30USZ,2021-01-11T18:29:18,Inside SuperCharger Ventures’ debut virtual edtech accelerator,"['Before the pandemic, edtech companies went decades without raising financing due to lack of interest from generalist venture capitalists. Now, more than a year since COVID-19 began, the sector is showing signs of maturation, from first profits to unicorns, potential IPOs and a rush of talent.Momentum in mind, cross-border venture capital firm SuperCharger Ventures is launching a debut accelerator exclusively for early-stage edtech founders. The 12-week accelerator, which kicks off today, is being held virtually, with six startups in the debut cohort.Interestingly, this isn’t the firms’ first time doing an accelerator. SuperCharger has led three cohorts of startups through a fintech-focused accelerator. The pivot from one booming category to another boils down to a simple dynamic, says SuperCharger Ventures co-founder Janos Barberis: banks.“Banks just don’t have the space or the bandwidth to start dealing with innovation right now,” Barberis said. The co-founder thinks that COVID-19 created a supply and demand unevenness between fintech services and banks, and as many branches struggle to stay open, “the first thing banks cut is innovation.”So, the firm is hopping to edtech, and taking a key lesson with it from its fintech experience: the importance of B2B and recurring revenue streams.“The corporate angle? It’s sticky, healthy and revenue driven,” Barberis said. “It’s healthy income, and I think right now investors are willing to pay for that healthy income.”Financially, Barberis’ argument is hard to disagree with. But when you look at some of the biggest edtech unicorns in this current moment, many are B2C, including Quizlet, Course Hero and ApplyBoard. It’s because in education, it sometimes can be easier to sell to the end-user than dealing with highly fragmented institutions — at least in the United States.4 edtech CEOs peer into the industry’s futureStill, B2B businesses have the biggest potential for reach, and we’re seeing consumer businesses turn COVID-19 demand into enterprise deals. There’s also hope to be found internationally, which can sometimes have a less fragmented market of institutions, says Barberis.Beyond B2B sales, cohort startups must be focused on expanding into European and Asian markets.Barberis sees opportunity in those markets, minus China, because both appear to have gaps in edtech. In Europe, he says there’s a high demand for corporate digital learning from universities, and in Asia, he thinks that investor education is necessary so bets can be placed in countries beyond simply China. On one end there is demand, and on the other end there is opportunity to generate demand.He leaves out China from the Asian market expansion because he thinks that the country, like the United States, is too saturated with companies right now.The programming fits the normal accelerator model, with information tailored explicitly to the world of education, such as how to partner with an education institution or shorten sales cycles (as so much of edtech B2B sales happens during the summer months).The firm doesn’t give any capital, but takes between 1-2% of equity in return for its services, which it estimates cost between $75,000 and $100,000 in “value.” SuperCharger culminates with a Demo Day, and companies in aggregate plan to raise between $15 to $20 million in venture capital.Other firms have similarly created accelerator programs during the pandemic to help with deal flow and stay competitive in the always-hot seed space, including NextView Ventures.NextView Ventures is launching a remote accelerator for startupsThis isn’t SuperCharger Ventures’ first time doing an accelerator. The firm held three fintech-focused accelerators in the past, graduating 49 companies. The pivot from one booming sector to another comes from fintech saturation, says Barberis.Out of 208 applications, SuperCharger landed on six companies in its debut cohort: Axon Park: Founded by Taylor Freeman, Axon Park is using virtual reality to virtually train workforces, such as teaching proper PPE procedures to healthcare professionals. It sells its programming to businesses, governments and universities.BSD Education: Co-founded by Christopher Geary and Nickey Khemchandani, the startup sells tech curriculum to schools teaching students between the ages of eight and 18. Beyond curriculum, the startup offers professional training development for teachers and a platform for online learning to be held.Dijital Kolej: Zeynep Dereli and Ferruh Gürtaş are betting on an online hybrid education model that balances asynchronous and synchronous learning throughout the day.Newcampus: The startup, launched by Will Fan and Fei Yao, describes itself as a gym membership for learning experiences. It’s part of the wave of companies focused on lifelong learning, with a focus on leadership information.Ringbeller: CJ Casciotta is working on a startup that uses interactive video lessons to teach kids soft skills, such as creativity and kindness.Roybi: Elnaz Sarraf and Ron Cheng are creating an AI-robot that teaches kids topics in STEM.']",,"['NavigationClose', 'COVID-19', 'SuperCharger Ventures', 'SuperCharger Ventures', 'Janos Barberis', 'COVID-19', 'Quizlet', 'ApplyBoard', 'Barberis', 'NextView Ventures', 'NextView Ventures', 'Barberis', 'Taylor Freeman', 'Axon Park', 'PPE', 'BSD Education', 'Christopher Geary', 'Nickey Khemchandani', 'Zeynep Dereli', 'Ferruh Gürtaş', 'Will Fan', 'Fei Yao', 'CJ Casciotta', 'Ron Cheng', 'AI', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'SuperCharger Ventures’', 'COVID-19', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Today’s announcement mostly focuses on the past, with a look back at the history of BMW’s infotainment platform, but the company did provide a bit more context and images of the new system that will make its official debut on the sizable displays in its upcoming iX soon.Obviously, we’re looking at a refreshed and more colorful design here. Based on what we can glance from the materials that BMW did make available, current BMW drivers shouldn’t have too high a learning curve as the overall layout still looks familiar.Despite the addition of BMW’s own personal voice assistant and gestures in recent updates, the iDrive knob in the center console isn’t going away, though it looks like it will be getting some design tweaks, too. Clearly, though, BMW isn’t planning to do away with physical controls anytime soon.Image Credits: BMWThe overall philosophy behind the update, BMW says, is to offer a system that is better able to utilize the potential of a connected car in order to “make the mobility experience even safer, even more comfortable and convenient, and even richer in variety.”The argument here is that the car, thanks to its myriad of sensors and connectivity, now often has access to far more information than the driver. That, BMW says, has influenced the new iDrive’s design, but the company isn’t quite ready to delve into any details yet, it seems.

After all, a humanoid robot will do that on the show floor (even if it’s only half of one). The French startup is back for this year’s show (insofar as anyone is really back for the show), with some key updates to its robot, Reachy.The biggest news this time out is the addition of teleoperation functionality using a virtual reality setup. Using a VR headset, a remote operator is capable of viewing video through the robot’s two face cameras. VR controllers are used to manipulate the robot’s arms for pick and place operations. The functionality can be used for, among other things, training the robot to perform tasks.Reachy is notable for being an open-source robotics platform. The $17,000 bot is potentially suitable for robotics research, including prototyping one’s own technology.

https://t.co/oygrMR1dcz,2021-01-11T15:32:45,Recycling startup Redwood Materials is now accepting your old smartphones,"['Redwood Materials, the recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, has quietly opened up its enterprise to everyday consumers and all of the old electronics sitting in their junk drawers.The move expands upon the Carson City, Nevada-based company’s existing and primary strategy to recycle scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics for corporate customers like Panasonic and Amazon.The startup has posted a “recycle with us” tab on its website, which states “Have lithium ion batteries or e-waste? We’ll recycle your phones, tablets, power tools and any other device with a lithium-ion battery.” There isn’t any more information on the website beyond an address, where consumers can send their e-waste, and a “contact us” button.Straubel told TechCrunch in October that its business model could someday evolve to include consumers because they had received so many inquiries from people. It seems that Redwood has decided to take the leap.Redwood Materials isn’t setting strict parameters on what consumers can send, a spokesperson said, who confirmed the company is even taking cables. Redwood told TechCrunch it wants to hear from consumers and will determine over time how it might expand the program. For instance, the company said it might formalize the consumer program and add shipping boxes and labels to make the process easier.For now, Redwood is going to open it up and see what happens.The majority of lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and other consumer electronics are not recycled and instead either sit forgotten in the owner’s junk drawer or enter the waste stream and end up in a landfill.Redwood Material is aiming to change that by creating a circular supply chain. Redwood collects scrap from Panasonic’s battery cell production as well as consumer electronics such as cell phone batteries, laptop computers and power tools from other corporations. The company then processes the discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers.Eventually, Straubel wants Redwood to be part of the end-of-life solution for electric vehicle batteries as well. The CEO has aspirations to set up facilities in strategic regional locations around the world to meet this need. For now, most of the items recycled and processed at Redwood’s two facilities in Carson City are for Panasonic and other unnamed consumer electronics-related companies.']",“recycle with us”,"['Redwood Materials', 'NavigationClose', 'Redwood Materials', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'Redwood MaterialsRedwood Materials', 'Straubel', 'Panasonic', 'Amazon', 'Straubel', 'Redwood', 'Redwood Materials', 'Redwood', 'Redwood Material', 'Panasonic', 'Panasonic', 'Straubel', 'Redwood’s', 'Panasonic', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAutomotiveTransportationPanasonicRedwood MaterialsTeslaRecycling', 'Redwood Materials', 'Korosec4:32', 'Straubel', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Today after shedding a little over 23% in the last 24 hours, one bitcoin is now worth around $31,800.Similarly, ether, the token associated with the Ethereum blockchain, peaked at a little over $1,300 on January 10. Today, after losing an even sharper 29% in the last 24 hours, ether tokens are worth around $960 apiece.Coins remain far above recent prices, with bitcoin setting new all-time highs this month and ether nearly reaching its early 2018 all-time highs.

This information is usually embedded in the file itself. The scraped videos from Parler appear to also include the precise location data of where the videos were taken. That metadata could be a gold mine of evidence for authorities investigating the Capitol riot, which may tie some rioters to their Parler accounts or help police unmask rioters based on their location data.Most web services remove metadata when you upload your photos and videos, but Parler apparently didn’t.Parler quickly became the social network of choice after President Trump was deplatformed from Twitter and Facebook for inciting the riot on January 6. But the tech giants said Parler violated their rules by not having a content moderation policy — which is what drew many users to the site.Many of the posts made calls to “burn down [Washington] D.C.,” while others called for violence and the execution of Vice President Mike Pence.Already several rioters have been arrested and charged with breaking into the Capitol building. Many of the rioters weren’t wearing masks (the pandemic notwithstanding), making it easier for them to be identified.

https://t.co/g2w99CJatn,2021-01-11T16:59:25,I’m a free-speech champion. I don’t even know what that means anymore.,"['The president of the United States is supposedly the most powerful man in the world. He also can’t post to Twitter. Or Facebook. Or a bunch of other social networks as we discovered over the course of the past week (he still has access to the nuclear launch codes though, so that’s an interesting dynamic to chew on).The bans last week were exceptional — but so is Trump. There may not be another president this century who pushes the line of public discourse quite like the current occupant of the White House (at least, one can only hope). If the whole Trump crisis was truly exceptional though, it could simply be ignored. Rules, even rules around free speech, have always had exceptions to handle exceptional circumstances. The president provokes a violent protest, he gets banned. A unique moment in American executive leadership, for sure. Yet, apart from the actor, it’s hardly an unusual response from the tech industry or any publisher where violent threats have been banned for decades under Supreme Court precedent.Why then aren’t we ignoring it? I think we can all feel that something greater is underfoot. The entire information architecture of our world has changed, and that has completely upended the structure of rules around free speech that have governed America in the modern era.Freedom of speech is deeply entwined with human progressivism, with science and rationality and positivism. The purpose of a marketplace of ideas is for arguments to be in dialogue with each other, to have their own facts and deductions checked, and for bad ideas to be washed out by better, more proven ones. Contentious at times yes, but a positive contention, one that ultimately is meant to elucidate more than provoke.I’m a free-speech “absolutist” because I believe in that human progress, and I believe that the concept of a marketplace of ideas is the best mechanism historically we have ever built as a species for exploring our world and introspecting ourselves. Yet, I also can’t witness the events that transpired last week and just pretend that our information commons is working well.I get it — that seems contradictory. I understand the argument that I’m supporting free speech but not really supporting it. Yet, there is a reasonable pause to be taken in this moment to ask some deeper, more foundational questions, for something is wrong with the system. I’m struggling with the same context that the ACLU in its official statement is struggling with:ACLU struggling here on this one….this is American Civil Liberties Union after all. pic.twitter.com/mWFOWJPwon— Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) January 9, 2021It’s a milquetoast response, a “we condemn but we are also concerned” sort of lukewarm mélange. It’s also a reasonable response to a rapidly changing environment around speech. In the same vein, I’m a staunch defender of the marketplace of ideas, well, a marketplace of ideas, one that unfortunately no longer exists today. Just think about everything that isn’t working:There’s too much information, and it’s impossible for any reasonable human to process it all.Much of that flood is garbage and outright fraud, or worse, brilliant pieces of psychological propaganda designed to distract and undermine the very information system on which it is distributed.We’ve never allowed so many people to gain access to the public square to distribute their missives, drivel and invective with such limited constraints.Few ideas are in dialogue anymore. Collegiality is mostly dead, as is constructivist thought. There is no marketplace anymore since the “stores” are no longer in the same public squares but in each of our own individual feeds.Coercive incentives from a handful of dominant, monopoly platforms drive wildly damaging communication practices, encouraging the proverbial “clickbait” over any form of careful discussion or debate.The vast majority of people seem to love this, given the extremely high user engagement numbers seen on tech platforms.We’ve known this event was coming for decades. Alvin Toffler’s “Future Shock,” about the inability of humans to process the complexity of the modern, industrialized world, came out in 1970. Cyberpunk literature and sci-fi more generally in the 1980s and 1990s has extensively grappled with this coming onslaught. As the internet expanded rapidly, books like Nicholas Carr’s “The Shallows” interrogated how the internet prevents us from thinking deeply. It was published a decade ago. Today, in your local bookstore (assuming you still have one and can actually still read texts longer than 1,000 words), you can find a whole wing analyzing the future of media and communications and what the internet is cognitively doing to us.My absolute belief in “free speech” was predicated on some pretty clear assumptions about how free speech was supposed to work in the United States. Those assumptions, unfortunately, no longer apply.We can no longer assume there is a proverbial public square where citizens debate, perhaps even angrily, the issues that confront them. We can no longer assume that information dreck gets filtered by editors, or by publishers, or by readers themselves. We can no longer assume that the people who reach us with their messages are somewhat vetted, and speaking from truth or facts.We can no longer assume that any part of the marketplace is frankly working at all.That’s what makes this era so challenging for those of us who rely every day on the right to free speech in our work and in our lives. Without those underlying assumptions, the right to free speech isn’t the bastion of human progressivism and rationality that we expect it to be. Our information commons won’t ensure that the best and highest-quality ideas are going to rise to the top and propel our collective discussion.I truly believe in free speech in its extensive, American sense. So do many friends who are similarly concerned for the perilous state of our marketplace of ideas. Yet, we all need to confront the reality that is before us: The system is really, truly broken, and just screaming “Free Speech!” is not going to change that.The way forward is to pivot the conversation around free speech to a broader question about how we improve the information architecture of our world. How do we ensure that creators and the people who generate ideas and analyze them can do so with the right economics? That means empowering writers and filmmakers and novelists and researchers and everyone else to be able to do quality work, over perhaps extended periods of time, without having to upload a new photo or insight every 10 minutes to stay “top of mind” lest their income should tumble.How can we align incentives at every layer of our communications to ensure that facts and “truth” will eventually win the day in the asymptote, if not always right away? How do you ensure that the power that comes with mass distribution of information is held by those who embody at least some notion of a public duty to accuracy and reasonableness?Most importantly, how do we improve the ability of every reader and viewer to process the information they see, and through their independent actions drive the discussion toward rationality? No marketplace can survive without smart and diligent customers, and the market for information is no exception. If people demand lies, the world is going to supply it to them — and in spades, as we have already seen.Tech can’t solve this alone, but it absolutely can and is obligated to be part of the solution. Platform alternatives with the right incentives in place can completely change the way humanity understands our world and what is happening. That’s an extremely important and intellectually interesting problem that should be enticing to any ambitious engineer and founder to tackle.I’ll always defend free speech, but I can’t defend the system in the state that we see it today. The only defense then is to work to rebuild this system, to buttress the components that are continuing to work and to repair or replace the ones that aren’t. I don’t believe the descent into rational hell has to be paved by misinformation. We all have the tools and power to make this system what it needs to be — what it should be.The deplatforming of President Trump\xa0']",Recycling startup Redwood Materials is now accepting your old smartphones,"['NavigationClose ScreenFeatured ArticleI’m', 'Crichton@dannycrichton', 'Trump', 'the White House', 'Supreme Court', 'ACLU', 'ACLU', 'American Civil Liberties Union', 'Eric Lipton', 'Alvin Toffler’s', 'Nicholas Carr’s', 'Trump', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'RiotFirst', 'Danny Crichton5:59', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/eSK28obf4N,2021-01-11T15:32:45,Recycling startup Redwood Materials is now accepting your old smartphones,"['Redwood Materials, the recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, has quietly opened up its enterprise to everyday consumers and all of the old electronics sitting in their junk drawers.The move expands upon the Carson City, Nevada-based company’s existing and primary strategy to recycle scrap from battery cell production and consumer electronics for corporate customers like Panasonic and Amazon.The startup has posted a “recycle with us” tab on its website, which states “Have lithium ion batteries or e-waste? We’ll recycle your phones, tablets, power tools and any other device with a lithium-ion battery.” There isn’t any more information on the website beyond an address, where consumers can send their e-waste, and a “contact us” button.Straubel told TechCrunch in October that its business model could someday evolve to include consumers because they had received so many inquiries from people. It seems that Redwood has decided to take the leap.Redwood Materials isn’t setting strict parameters on what consumers can send, a spokesperson said, who confirmed the company is even taking cables. Redwood told TechCrunch it wants to hear from consumers and will determine over time how it might expand the program. For instance, the company said it might formalize the consumer program and add shipping boxes and labels to make the process easier.For now, Redwood is going to open it up and see what happens.The majority of lithium-ion batteries used in smartphones and other consumer electronics are not recycled and instead either sit forgotten in the owner’s junk drawer or enter the waste stream and end up in a landfill.Redwood Material is aiming to change that by creating a circular supply chain. Redwood collects scrap from Panasonic’s battery cell production as well as consumer electronics such as cell phone batteries, laptop computers and power tools from other corporations. The company then processes the discarded goods, extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, and supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers.Eventually, Straubel wants Redwood to be part of the end-of-life solution for electric vehicle batteries as well. The CEO has aspirations to set up facilities in strategic regional locations around the world to meet this need. For now, most of the items recycled and processed at Redwood’s two facilities in Carson City are for Panasonic and other unnamed consumer electronics-related companies.']", suspension of Trump’s official accounts from Twitter and Facebook last week,"['Redwood Materials', 'NavigationClose', 'Redwood Materials', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'Redwood MaterialsRedwood Materials', 'Straubel', 'Panasonic', 'Amazon', 'Straubel', 'Redwood', 'Redwood Materials', 'Redwood', 'Redwood Material', 'Panasonic', 'Panasonic', 'Straubel', 'Redwood’s', 'Panasonic', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAutomotiveTransportationPanasonicRedwood MaterialsTeslaRecycling', 'Redwood Materials', 'Korosec4:32', 'Straubel', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

You can send and receive money, hold money in your account and use your card for in-store and online purchases.Over the past few years, Revolut has greatly expanded beyond that simple premise. You can buy cryptocurrencies, stocks and commodities. You can set money aside in a vault. You can get travel and mobile phone insurance products.Some of these features have been developed in-house. Other features have required partnerships with other fintech companies. While you can do a lot of things with your Revolut account, it’s still not technically a bank in the U.K.It has been great when it comes to growth, but it can be limiting when it comes to revenue opportunities and product offering. If Revolut gets a banking license, the company will be able to offer full-service current accounts with overdrafts and loans in the U.K. Revolut could also offer credit cards.Customers will also be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). If Revolut becomes a bank and disappears, customers are protected up to £85,000 per person.Revolut currently has 13 million customers and a valuation of $5.5 billion.

This represents a more than 65% discount off Hulu’s ad-supported subscription, which typically sells for $5.99 per month, the company says.The students will gain access to the same version of Hulu’s streaming service, which includes its library of thousands of on-demand movies and TV, including Hulu Originals. They’ll also be able to use the recently launched Watch Party feature that allows users to co-watch with friends and family in different locations as well as use group chat in a sidebar as the content plays.Over the past few years, Hulu has offered a variety of deals and discounts aimed at growing its user base. In fall 2017, for example, it partnered with Spotify on a combo deal, also aimed at students. It later expanded this deal to include Showtime and then opened it to a broader audience. In 2019, Hulu also again dropped the standard price for its streaming service while raising the cost of its Live TV add-on and rolled out an even more discounted Spotify-Hulu combo.Hulu officially launches its co-viewing feature, Watch PartyThese promotions help to boost Hulu’s subscriber base to its entry-level service in the hopes that users will later choose to upgrade to Hulu’s more expensive plans. For students, in particular, the goal is to capture the market while users are young and paying for subscriptions possibly for the first time. When the students graduate, Hulu believes they’ll continue to still see the value in its service and convert to fully paid customers.This new student deal arrives a couple of months after Hulu once again raised the price of its Hulu with Live TV plan — this time to help fund the addition of 14 new ViacomCBS channels. As Hulu’s Live TV service becomes to look more like traditional pay TV in terms of its pricing, it becomes even more important to attract users to Hulu’s on-demand plan as the first step toward later upsells.Hulu says the new student deal is “evergreen” and begins to roll out today.Hulu will increase the price of its live TV service again on December 18th']",submit their pitch decks right here!,"['NavigationClose', 'Hulu’s', 'Hulu’s', 'Hulu Originals', 'Watch Party', 'Hulu', 'Spotify', 'Showtime', 'Hulu', 'Spotify-Hulu', 'Hulu’s', 'Hulu’s', 'Hulu', 'Hulu’s', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Perez5:00', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

There are a number of options for disposing and recycling these objects that often contain rare earth and sometimes harmful material.

After all, your three-year-old smartphone may not be the latest and greatest, but that doesn’t mean it’s necessarily worthless.During this morning’s CES kickoff press conference, Samsung outlined its new Galaxy Upcycling at Home program. For now, we got some pretty broad strokes about the program — and we’ll likely get more information at this Friday’s Galaxy Unpacked event. Here’s what the company had to say: “The new program reimagines the lifecycle of an older Galaxy phone and offers consumers options on how they might be able to repurpose their device to create a variety of convenient IoT tools.”Recycling startup Redwood Materials is now accepting your old smartphonesExamples from the presser include a baby monitor, pet-care sensor for turning on lights remotely and a more abstract “digitally safe home” using Samsung Knox.

https://t.co/lwPHXp3ETB,2021-01-11T15:06:36,At least one of Samsung’s new robots is definitely coming out (hint: it’s the vacuum),"['For the last couple of years, Samsung’s CES press conferences have featured a parade of futuristic home robots. They are smart, dexterous and impressive (and reasonably adorable). But home robots are hard. Like, really, really hard. There’s a reason the robotic vacuum continues to be one real viable home robot nearly 20 years after the Roomba’s introduction.It’s the same reason the JetBot 90 AI+ Vacuum seems to be the one really viable bit of home robotics from the event. The company also showed off updates to the Bot Handy it introduced at last year’s show. That, coupled with the new Bot Care, is far more in line with the kind of humanoid designs science fiction has led us believe we’ll be getting in the next few years.And science fiction seems to still be an operative descriptor here. At last year’s show, the robots put on a kind of Chuck E. Cheese-style presentation, running through choreographed tasks on stage, with limited human interaction. Understandably — there’s a lot that goes into this sort of thing, and for the moment, the technology feels like proof of concept more than anything.Image Credits: SamsungThe company mentioned the “not too distant future” in reference to the tech, while the small print at the corner of the screen said “This robot is undergoing research and development, and is not yet for sale.” That seems to be putting it mildly, as the wheeled Bot Care reminds its owner of a meeting and pops up a screen for a conference call.I don’t think anyone has an illusions that we’ll be seeing any of this tech during the current pandemic, though I suppose there’s an argument to be made that this is the “new normal” the company is prepping us for. The Bot Handy moving dishes from the sink to dishwasher seems roughly as realistic.Image Credits: SamsungI’m happy to be wrong, but I don’t think any of us are holding our breath for a viable version of this tech in the near term. We can, however, appreciate the JetBot 90 AI+ Vacuum. That, after all, has a rough date, arriving in the U.S. at some point in the first half of this year.The robot vacuum features an on-board lidar sensor, coupled with an object detection algorithm that helps it build an ideal path around the user’s home. Interestingly, the camera can also be viewed remotely by the user, doubling as a kind of security cam (though Samsung seems to avoid actually using the word) and a pet monitor.Is Samsung getting serious about robotics?']",including a Star Wars Storm Trooper robot,"['Samsung’s', 'NavigationClose', 'Samsung’s', 'Samsung’s', 'Roomba', 'Chuck E.

https://t.co/vTj6GUTOJ0,2021-01-11T14:47:07,"Alula, a platform for cancer caregivers, patients and survivors, raises $2.2 million","['According to the National Cancer Institute, some 1.8 million people are diagnosed with cancer each year in the U.S. alone. Factor in the friends, family and loved ones of those patients, and the number of people affected by this disease can boggle the mind.Liya Shuster-Bier understands this struggle all too well. After her mother was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, she herself was diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, transitioning from caregiver to patient to survivor. Her experience led her to start Alula, a platform for those fighting cancer, that launches officially today.Alongside its launch, Alula is also announcing that it closed a $2.2 million seed round from BBG Ventures, Andy Dunn, Metrodora Ventures, Thrive Capital, Village Global, Homebrew, Shrug Capital, Basement Ventures, Company Ventures, K5 Global, K50 Ventures, and several angels.Despite the sheer number of people affected by cancer and cancer treatment, there aren’t many resources out there to help them understand what to expect.“A lot of people are researching scattered parts of the internet for various elements of product recommendations, ways to communicate ways to raise money for your treatment, ways to understand how to tell people or to announce to your boss that you have treatment,” said Shuster-Bier. “It is not in a singular place, it is not organized in a radically honest way. It’s hard to understand who to trust.”Alula is a multi-pillared platform that, in the words of Shuster-Bier, takes a radically honest approach to preparing its users for everything they’ll go through during their treatment. That includes products they’ll need to deal with the treatment process, communication tools to help coordinate support, and content to encourage and support patients on their journey.Shuster-Bier explained that her oncologists and doctors prepared her for some of the after effects of her treatment, like losing her hair, but couldn’t recommend a good place to purchase a wig, for example. So Alula has built out a marketplace with products that have been recommended by patients, and guided by an advisory board of medical experts. It includes personalized registries and ‘cancer survival kits’ that are categorized by the type of treatment a patient is going through.Alula also provides communication tools to users. Many people use email to share the news of their cancer diagnosis with their friends and family. It’s often the most difficult email a person has ever had to write, says the company, and Alula guides them through that process with customizable templates. Alula also provides shareable treatment calendars to help coordinate a ride to treatment or organizing people to sit with patients at treatment, etc.Image Credits: AlulaThe truth is that the cancer journey is never really over. There is always something new to be prepared for and understand.“I am continuously surprised how the after effects persist and are new,” explained Shuster-Bier. “I’m currently struggling with medically induced menopause, at the tender age of 32. I just recently got diagnosed with radiation fibrosis in my chest and back, which is the stiffening of my muscles from my radiation, and I am seeing a cardiologist because one of the chemo drugs that I needed was cardiotoxic.”To address this, the company is also building out a library of content to help patients and caregivers navigate the difficult process. This type of information is usually only found through conversations with other cancer patients during treatment, and Alula is looking to centralize and organize that content for its users.Right now, the business model is focused on affiliate fees that come from the marketplace, but Shuster-Bier explained that Alula is looking to start buying products wholesale that it can retail.Today, Shuster-Bier is not only celebrating the launch of Alula, but of her three-year cancerversary and nearly two years of being in remission.']",announced,"['Alula', 'TechCrunchOpen NavigationClose ScreenAlula', 'the National Cancer Institute', 'Liya Shuster-Bier', 'BBG Ventures', 'Andy Dunn', 'Metrodora Ventures', 'Thrive Capital', 'Village Global', 'Basement Ventures', 'Company Ventures', 'K5 Global', 'K50 Ventures', 'Shuster-Bier', 'Shuster-Bier', 'Shuster-Bier', 'Alula', 'Alula', 'Alula', 'AlulaThe', 'Shuster-Bier', 'Shuster-Bier', 'Shuster-Bier', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsTCAlula', 'Crook3:47', 'the National Cancer Institute', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/PIoVIMbfVl,2021-01-11T14:30:18,Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now are coming to LG TVs,"['LG spent a good chunk of its CES press conference talking about its lineup of TVs for 2021. You can expect bigger, slimmer and brighter TVs. I’m not going to list the specifications of new models. But there are a few new features that are worth mentioning.LG doesn’t use Android TV for the operating system. Instead, the company has its own operating system called webOS. App developers have to release specific versions of their apps for LG’s smart TVs. And the company announced that Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now are coming to LG 2021 TVs.Google’s cloud gaming service will arrive in late 2021. It won’t be available everywhere, as Stadia is only available in a handful of countries. But if you live in a country where Stadia is available, you will be able to unplug your Chromecast to access Stadia.Stadia works a bit like a console that runs in the cloud. You can buy games and run them in a data center near you. The video feed is streamed directly to your screen and your gamepad controls are relayed to the server.As for Nvidia’s cloud gaming service, it is coming later this year. This service is a bit different as you can take advantage of your Steam, Epic Games, GOG or Ubisoft Connect libraries.Nvidia has favored its own set-top box in the past with a GeForce Now app on the Nvidia Shield TV. Recently, the Android app has been updated with support for more devices, and it looks like it’s expanding beyond Android TV with webOS support.LG also announced that it is updating webOS with a brand new interface this year. The overlay menu at the bottom of the screen has been replaced with a full-screen menu. You’ll be able to find your favorite apps, access live TV and get some content recommendations — and, yes, there will be ads.If you’re playing games, there will be a new game menu to access the most relevant settings. For instance, you’ll be able to switch from one TV profile to another from that menu depending on the type of games that you’re playing (FPS, racing games, etc.). It sounds pretty useless to me, as you mostly want to reduce latency as much as possible with any genre. You’ll also be able to turn on G-Sync and FreeSync if you’re using a compatible device.When it comes to new OLED TVs, there are the entry-line A1 models with old processors, and the C1 models with support for modern game consoles thanks to variable refresh rate, low latency, etc. At the top of the lineup, the G1 models come in three different sizes (77 inches, 65 inches and 55 inches).Image Credits: LG']",Politico,"['Google Stadia', 'Nvidia GeForce Now', 'LG', 'NavigationClose', 'Nvidia GeForce Now', 'LG TVsRomain Dillet@romaindillet /', 'Android TV', 'LG’s', 'Google Stadia', 'Nvidia GeForce Now', 'Stadia', 'Stadia', 'Stadia', 'Stadia', 'Nvidia', 'GOG', 'Ubisoft Connect', 'Nvidia', 'the Nvidia Shield TV', 'Android', 'Android TV', 'FPS', 'G-Sync', 'FreeSync', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'GeForce NowGoogle Stadia', 'Nvidia GeForce Now', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

PC sales saw a nice spike last year, even as smartphone sales continued to slip. There was a lot of adapting that needed to be done, moving from offices to virtual work places, and now we’re beginning to see the fruits of that push from hardware makers.The new Surface Pro 7+ certainly seems to fit the bill. I’m still hesitant to recommend a convertible with a keyboard case as a primary productivity device, but people do seem increasingly willing to move in that direction.Image Credits: MicrosoftTop line features include optional LTE and faster processing (up to 2.1x per Microsoft’s numbers) via an 11th Gen Intel Core processor. That’s paired with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. There’s a 1080p front-facing webcam for video conferences and a quartet of mics.Ports include one full-size USB-A and that pesky Surface connector and, unfortunately, only a single USB-C. Microsoft seems pretty committed to that last bit, to its detriment. The device should get up to 15 hours of battery on a charge — which isn’t exceptional, but isn’t bad either.It starts at $899 for the Wi-Fi version and $1,149 for LTE.

If you’re familiar at all with the brand here in the states, it’s likely for its STEM or other robotic toys, including a Star Wars Storm Trooper robot from a few years back (my own first exposure to the company). But with around $940 million in funding, it seems the sky’s the limit, in terms of product expansion.Among its announcements at CES today is the arrival of a line of UV-C disinfecting robots. The need is certainly clear, following the events of the past 12 months. In fact, UBTech isn’t even the first company to introduce a UV robot for the show — that distinction falls to LG, which is set to offer its own solution this year.And like LG, UBTech has already begun piloting its tech. The State of Delaware’s Department of Education has deployed models in a number of locations. The company is producing a few different models of Adibot — including rolling and stationary versions. They’re available for purchase starting this week, with financing plans starting at $15 a day.As the company notes, while the need for such functionality has been at top of mind during the COVID-19 pandemic, it certainly doesn’t start or end with that specific virus.

https://t.co/zwyznAyilq,2021-01-11T13:52:18,"Moderna is developing three new mRNA-based vaccines for seasonal flu, HIV and Nipah virus","['Moderna, the biotech company behind one of the two mRNA-based vaccines currently being rolled out globally to stem the tide of COVID-19, has announced that it will pursue development programs around three new vaccine candidates in 2021. These include potential vaccines for HIV, seasonal flu and the Nipah virus. Moderna’s development and clinical trial of its COVID-19 vaccine is among the fastest in history, and thus far its results have been very promising, buoying hopes for the efficacy of other preventative treatments being generated using this technology which is new to human clinical use.An mRNA vaccine differs from typical, historical vaccines because it involves providing a person with just a set of instructions on how to build specific proteins that will trigger a body’s natural defenses. The mRNA instructions, which are temporary and do not affect a person’s actual DNA, simply prompt the body’s cells to produce proteins that mirror those used by a virus to attach to and infect cells. The independent proteins are then fought off by a person’s natural immune response, which provides a lasting lesson in how to fight off any future proteins that match that profile, including those which help viruses attach to and infect people.FDA authorizes Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency useModerna’s new programs will target not only seasonal flu, but also a combinatory vaccine that could target both the regular flu and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that leads to COVID-19. The HIV candidate, which is developed in collaboration with both the AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is expected to enter into Phase 1 trials this year. Nipah virus is a highly lethal illness that can cause respiratory and neurological symptoms, and which is particularly a threat in India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore.Indeed, mRNA-based vaccines have long held potential for future vaccine development, in part because of their flexibility and programmability, and in part because they don’t use any active or dormant virus, which reduces their risks in terms of causing any direct infections up front. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred significant investment and regulatory/health and safety investment into the technology, paving the way for its use in other areas, including these new vaccine candidate trials by Moderna.']",impending merger with Sweden’s Volvo,"['Moderna', 'Nipah', 'NavigationClose', 'Nipah', 'NurPhoto', 'COVID-19', 'Nipah', 'FDA', 'Moderna’s', 'Bill', 'Melinda Gates Foundation', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Nipah', 'COVID-19', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/bantPdpryo,2021-01-11T12:54:43,Europe seizes on social media’s purging of Trump to bang the drum for regulation,"[""Big tech’s decision to pull the plug on president Donald Trump’s presence on their platforms, following his supporters’ attack on the US capital last week, has been seized on in Europe as proof — if proof were needed — that laws have not kept pace with tech market power and platform giants must face consequences over the content they amplify and monetize.Writing in Politico, the European Commission’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, dubs the 6/1 strike at the heart of the US political establishment as social media’s ‘9/11’ moment — aka, the day the whole world woke up to the real-world impact of unchecked online hate and lies.Since then Trump has been booted from a number of digital services, and the conservative social media app Parler has also been ejected from the App Store and Google Play over a failure to moderate violent threats, after Trump supporters flocked to the app in the wake of Facebook’s and Twitter’s crackdown.At the time of writing, Parler is also poised to be booted by its hosting provider AWS, while Stripe has reportedly pulled the plug on Trump’s ability to use its payment tools to fleece supporters. (Although when this reporter asked in November whether Trump was breaching its TOC by using its payment tools for his ‘election defense fund’ Stripe ignored TechCrunch’s emails…)“If there was anyone out there who still doubted that online platforms have become systemic actors in our societies and democracies, last week’s events on Capitol Hill is their answer. What happens online doesn’t just stay online: It has — and even exacerbates — consequences ‘in real life’ too,” Breton writes.“Last week’s insurrection marked the culminating point of years of hate speech, incitement to violence, disinformation and destabilization strategies that were allowed to spread without restraint over well-known social networks. The unrest in Washington is proof that a powerful yet unregulated digital space — reminiscent of the Wild West — has a profound impact on the very foundations of our modern democracies.”The Europe Commission proposed a major update to the rules for digital services and platform giants in December, when it laid out the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act — saying it’s time to level the regulatory playing field by ensuring content and activity that’s illegal offline is similarly sanctioned online.The Commission’s proposal also seeks to address the market power of tech giants with proposals for additional oversight and extra rules for the largest platforms that have the potential to cause the greatest societal harm.Understanding Europe’s big push to rewrite the digital rulebookUnsurprisingly, then, Breton has seized on the chaotic scenes in Washington to push this already-formed tech policy plan — with his eye on a domestic audience of European governments and elected members of the European Parliament whose support is needed to pass the legislation and reboot the region’s digital rules.“The fact that a CEO can pull the plug on POTUS’s loudspeaker without any checks and balances is perplexing. It is not only confirmation of the power of these platforms, but it also displays deep weaknesses in the way our society is organized in the digital space,” he warns.“These last few days have made it more obvious than ever that we cannot just stand by idly and rely on these platforms’ good will or artful interpretation of the law. We need to set the rules of the game and organize the digital space with clear rights, obligations and safeguards. We need to restore trust in the digital space. It is a matter of survival for our democracies in the 21st century.”The DSA will force social media to clean up its act on content and avoid the risk of arbitrary decision-making by giving platforms “clear obligations and responsibilities to comply with these laws, granting public authorities more enforcement powers and ensuring that all users’ fundamental rights are safeguarded”, Breton goes on to argue.The commissioner also addresses US lawmakers directly — calling for Europe and the US to join forces on Internet regulation and engage in talks aimed at establishing what he describes as “globally coherent principles”, suggesting the DSA as a starting point for discussions. So he’s not wasting the opportunity of #MAGA-induced chaos to push a geopolitical agenda for EU tech policy too.Last month the Commission signalled a desire to work with the incoming Biden administration on a common approach to tech governance, saying it hoped US counterparts would work with to shape global standards for technologies like AI and to force big tech to be more responsible, among other areas. And recent events in Washington do seem to be playing into that hand — although it remains to be seen how the incoming Biden administration will approach regulating big tech.“The DSA, which has been carefully designed to answer all of the above considerations at the level of our Continent, can help pave the way for a new global approach to online platforms — one that serves the general interest of our societies. By setting a standard and clarifying the rules, it has the potential to become a paramount democratic reform serving generations to come,” Breton concludes.Europe will push to work with the US on tech governance, post-TrumpTwitter’s decision to (finally) pull the plug on Trump also caught the eye of UK minister Matt Hancock, the former\xa0 secretary of state for the digital brief (now the health secretary). Speaking to the BBC this weekend, he suggested the unilateral decision “raises questions” about how big tech is regulated that would result in “consequences”.“The scenes, clearly encouraged by President Trump — the scenes at the Capitol — were terrible — and I was very sad to see that because American democracy is such a proud thing. But there’s something else that has changed, which is that social media platforms are making editorial decisions now. That’s clear because they’re choosing who should and shouldn’t have a voice on their platform,” he told the Andrew Marr program.The BBC reports that Hancock also told Sky News Twitter’s ban on Trump means social media platforms are taking editorial decisions — which he said “raises questions about their editorial judgements and the way that they’re regulated”.Hancock’s remarks are noteworthy because back in 2018, during his time as digital minister, he said the government would legislate to introduce a statutory code of conduct on social media platforms forcing them to act against online abuse.More than two years’ later, the UK’s safety-focused plan to regulate the Internet is still yet to be put before parliament — but late last year ministers committed to introducing an Online Safety Bill this year.\xa0Under the plan, the UK’s media regulator, Ofcom, will gain new powers to oversee tech platforms — including the ability to levy fines for non-compliance with a safety-focused duty of care of up to 10% of a company’s annual turnover.The proposal covers a wide range of digital services, not just social media. Larger platforms are also slated to have the greatest responsibility for moderating content and activity. And — at least in its current form — the proposed law is intended to apply not just to content that’s illegal under UK law but also the fuzzier category of ‘harmful’ content.That’s something the European Commission proposal has steered clear of — with more subjective issues like disinformation set to be tackled via a beefed-up (but still voluntary) code of practice, instead of being baked into digital services legislation.\xa0So online speech looks set to be one area of looming regulatory divergence in Europe, with the UK now outside the bloc.Last year, the government said larger social media platforms — such as Facebook, TikTok, Instagram and Twitter — are likely to “need to assess the risk of legal content or activity on their services with ‘a reasonably foreseeable risk of causing significant physical or psychological\xa0harm to adults’” under the forthcoming Online Safety Bill.“They will then need to make clear what type of ‘legal but harmful’ content is acceptable on their platforms in their terms and conditions and enforce this transparently and consistently,” it added, suggesting the UK will in fact legislate to force platforms to make ‘editorial’ decisions.The consequences Hancock thus suggests are coming for tech platforms look rather akin to the ‘editorial’ decisions they have been making in recent days.Albeit, the uncomfortable difference he seems to have been articulating is between tech platforms that have massive unilateral power to silence the US president at a stroke and at a point of their own choosing vs tech platforms being made to comply with a pre-defined rules-based order set by legislators and regulators.UK Online Safety Bill, coming next year, will propose fines of up to 10% of annual turnover for breaching duty of care rulesIn additional high level responses on Monday, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, described Twitter’s shuttering of Trump’s account as “problematic”, per Bloomberg, which quotes her chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, making the comment at a regular news conference in Berlin. Rights like the freedom of speech “can be interfered with, but by law and within the framework defined by the legislature — not according to a corporate decision”, the spokesman added.Similar views were espoused by the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, who said it should be for states and the justice system to regulate big tech, not for the “digital oligarchy” to regulate itself.He also described regulation of big tech as “necessary”.Ce qui me choque c’est que c'est Twitter qui ferme le compte de Trump.

https://t.co/V4u0YTY5bj,2021-01-11T12:00:20,"The Station: The 2021 predictions issue, part two","['The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation.\xa0Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every Sunday in your inbox.\xa0Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.Last week, I provided some of my predictions for 2021 focused on autonomous vehicle technology and electric vehicles. I’ll weigh in today with a few predictions about the rest of the “future of transportation” sector, including ride-hailing, on-demand delivery and in-car tech.Email me at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips. You can also send a direct message to me at Twitter — @kirstenkorosec.Alrighty, here’s the remaining predictions for 2021.Delivery On-demand delivery will continue to grow even as consumers return to physical stores, which will put pressure on the logistics ecosystem. The retailers that have the best success will be the ones that have locked in multiple channels to get their “goods” to the consumer.Big retailers and even smaller local stores have come to understand that their physical location has become an extended part of the supply chain. Startups that have developed platforms to make it easier to manage inventory and get it to the consumer will continue to pop up.Meanwhile, the increase in demand for delivery will encourage giants like Amazon and Walmart to invest in technological solutions to meet their needs. This might include partnering with or acquiring startups. (This goes beyond interests in longer-term efforts like autonomous vehicle delivery.)Delivery apps such as Uber Eats, DoorDash and Instacart will face increased scrutiny for use of gig economy workers as well as whether businesses benefit from using them. This may very well spawn local businesses to find their own in-house solutions. Demand will rise for digital tools that help optimize delivery fleets and platforms designed to help companies gets goods to consumers without relying on Uber, DoorDash and others.Restaurant groups will pull together to offer delivery hubs from ghost kitchens, a prediction that mirrors one shared with me from Khaled Naim, the CEO of last-mile delivery management software startup Onfleet. I believe local stores will make the same efforts.\xa0I expect more pitches from companies hawking curbside management tools and subscription delivery platforms.On the ride-hailing front, shuttle companies like Via will continue to grow (despite concerns about sharing rides) and make acquisitions to round out their current offerings.\xa0Via will continue to sell its platform to cities as opposed to standing up more of its own operations. Via handles booking, routing, passenger and vehicle assignment and identification, customer experience and fleet management. And it will likely look for ways to broaden its services to become more appealing.In-car techSome of the trends that started two years ago will continue to play out. Automakers are increasing the size and display resolution of infotainment screens in vehicles. Sadly, only a handful will unlock the more important piece of the infotainment system: the user interface.Two announcements this past week — one from holographic startup Envisics and the other from Mercedes — hint at what’s to come in 2021.Mercedes unveiled January 7 its next-generation MBUX Hyperscreen, which features a 56-inch curved screen that runs the length of the dashboard. The MBUX Hyperscreen will be optional in the 2022 Mercedes EQS, the flagship sedan under the automaker’s electric EQ brand.Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen. Image Credits: Mercedes-BenzI’m interested in and maybe even encouraged by (I have yet to test it) the UI. Mercedes chose to put information on charging, entertainment, phone, navigation, social media, connectivity and massage — yes massage — right up front on the screen. This means no scrolling through menus or using the voice assistant to locate these options.The system’s software, which will learn the patterns of the driver, will prompt the user, removing any need to\xa0go deeper into the sub-menu. The\xa0navigation map is always visible in the center and located just below\xa0it are the controls for the phone and entertainment — or the feature that best suits the specific situation, according to the automaker.Meanwhile, Envisics announced a partnership with Panasonic Automotive Systems to jointly develop and commercialize a new generation of head-up displays for cars, trucks and SUVs.Holographic startup Envisics partners with Panasonic to fast-track in-car AR techEnvisics’ technology allows for head-up displays to have higher resolution, wide color gamut and large images that can be overlaid upon reality. The technology can also project information at multiple distances simultaneously. The company’s founder Jamieson Christmas told me that in the short term this will provide relatively simple augmented reality applications like navigation, highlighting the lane you’re supposed to be in and some safety applications.Image Credits: Envisics“But as you look forward into things like autonomous driving it unlocks a whole realm of other opportunities like entertainment and video conferencing,” he said.Finally, I expect more chatter and maybe even deployments of driver monitoring systems as automakers roll out more advanced driver assistance systems that allow for “hands-free” operations in certain conditions.I want to stress however, that having a DMS is only part of the solution. The safe operation of an advanced driver assistance system comes down to how well the driver understands the features and can easily see or hear when they’re on and off. A number of vehicle models, with the regular ol’ less-advanced versions of ADAS, already fail at properly communicating to drivers when features are on and off. My hope for 2021 and beyond is that there’s an effort to improve this shortfall.For those who missed last week’s predictions, here is my recap on AVs and EVs.Autonomous vehiclesThe wave of consolidation that began in 2020 will continue this year, leaving fewer players that are aiming to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology in three distinct areas: robotaxis, trucking and delivery.In 2020, Starsky Robotics shut down, Uber sold its self-driving subsidiary to Aurora and autonomous delivery startup Nuro acquired Ike Robotics. This evolution is not yet complete.I’ll be paying attention to the activities of all the big AV players, including Cruise, Motional, Waymo and Zoox. I’m particularly interested in how Aurora will handle absorbing Uber ATG into its operations. I’m also watching for progress at Argo AI, which has spent the past several months integrating VW’s self-driving subsidiary Autonomous Intelligent Driving (AID) into its operations.I expect big moves by the often-overlooked Voyage, including new partnerships and driverless operations.Autonomous delivery will see the most investment, consolidation and commercialization activity in 2021. This won’t be the year when autonomous delivery becomes ubiquitous. But expect more pilot programs in urban, and even suburban and rural areas as companies try to figure out what environment and form factor — sidewalk bots, purpose-built vehicles that operate on roads or drones — produces the best economics.New regionally focused entrants will pop up in 2021 and drone delivery companies will expand to larger geofenced areas.I’m also curious to see what becomes of Postmates’ autonomous robot now that Uber has completed its acquisition of the on-demand delivery company.Nuro’s second-generation R2 delivery robot. Image credit: NuroCompanies pursuing autonomous trucking are going to learn that long-haul logistics are more difficult and expensive than previously thought. While companies will continue to focus on Class 8 trucks that can operate without a human, expect greater activity in the so-called middle-mile logistics market. This is an area that startup Gatik AI has targeted with some successful results.The middle-mile market, in which autonomous trucks run frequent trips from large distribution centers to local retailers, will become increasingly important as consumers continue to order groceries and other goods online. Amazon, Walmart and Kroger are just a few of the large and deep-pocketed companies keenly interested in finding faster and cheaper ways to move goods. Expect more investments and even acquisitions from big retailers.Autonomous vehicle regulations in the United States will shift in 2021 due to the new Biden Administration. The changes won’t happen immediately; there will be far more activity in 2022 and beyond. But there will be change nonetheless.The Trump administration has taken a light touch to autonomous vehicle development and deployment, choosing to stick with voluntary guidelines instead of creating new mandatory rules. For instance, last month the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted a notice that clarified AV policy and seemed to make the path to deployment much easier. (Read the details in my December 21 newsletter.)The Station: Zoox’s six-year ride, Aurora makes its Uber ATG employee picks and NHTSA takes a new position on AVsPresident-elect Joe Biden nominated former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg as the next Secretary of Transportation, a Cabinet position that will have him overseeing the Federal Highway Administration and NHTSA, among other roles. The expectation is that Buttigieg will lead the charge (ahem) for electric charging infrastructure. What’s less clear is how he and the Biden administration will approach automated vehicle technology and the advanced driver assistance systems found in today’s modern vehicles.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the automotive industry group, released its four-year plan last month for how it wants the federal government to act. The group made 14 recommendations that includes reforming regulations to allow for AV deployment at scale. Expect the Alliance for Automotive Innovation to push for a national AV pilot program and a new vehicle class for AVs.Electric vehiclesImage Credits: Bryce DurbinA bevy of new electric vehicles from startups and legacy automakers will arrive in 2021. The Lucid Air, Rivian R1T and R1S, Audi Q4 etron and Nissan Ariya will come to market, while production ramps up for the Ford Mustang Mach-E and VW ID.4.In the latter half of the year, we should also see a few electric pickups from Lordstown Motors and the first deliveries of\xa0the\xa0BMW iX and the GMC Hummer EV. I don’t expect the Tesla Cybertruck to appear until the very end of 2021, if not 2022.GMC reveals the Hummer EV: 1,000 HP, 350-mile range and 0-60 in ‘around 3 seconds’In the U.S., I’ll be watching for policy changes at the federal level that might encourage more consumers to make the switch to electric vehicles. According to Politico, there is $40 billion in unused Energy Department loan authority that was awarded under the 2009 stimulus. These funds could become a central piece of the incoming Biden administration’s climate and infrastructure plan. While those loans will likely go toward energy storage and other infrastructure, it’s worth noting that former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm will be heading up the DOE. Granholm was directly involved in the Obama administration’s bailout of the U.S. auto industry during the Great Recession.Electric bikes, mopeds, scooters and even skateboards will continue to grow in 2021 as consumers look for means of getting around town without buying a car or using personal transit.That doesn’t mean every e-bike or scooter company will prosper. Some shared electric scooter companies have struggled in 2020 or shut down altogether. Others are switching to subscription-based models. Expect the tinkering to continue.']",Ajaib Group,"['NavigationClose', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'Mercedes-BenzThe Station', 'Point A', 'Amazon', 'Uber Eats', 'DoorDash', 'Instacart', 'Uber', 'DoorDash', 'Khaled Naim', 'Via', 'Mercedes', 'MBUX Hyperscreen', 'The MBUX Hyperscreen', 'Mercedes EQS', 'EQ', 'Mercedes-EQ', 'MBUX Hyperscreen', 'UI', 'Mercedes', 'Panasonic Automotive Systems', 'Panasonic', 'Jamieson Christmas', 'DMS', 'ADAS', 'Starsky Robotics', 'Uber', 'Aurora', 'Nuro', 'Ike Robotics', 'Cruise', 'Waymo', 'Zoox', 'Aurora', 'ATG', 'Argo AI', 'VW’s', 'Voyage', 'Uber', 'NuroCompanies', 'Amazon', 'Biden Administration', 'Trump', 'the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration', 'Aurora', 'ATG', 'NHTSA', 'Joe Biden', 'Pete Buttigieg', 'Transportation', 'Cabinet', 'the Federal Highway Administration', 'NHTSA', 'Buttigieg', 'Biden', 'The Alliance for Automotive Innovation', 'the Alliance for Automotive Innovation', 'Nissan Ariya', 'Ford', 'Mustang Mach-E', 'Lordstown Motors', 'the GMC Hummer EV', 'the Hummer EV', 'Energy Department', 'Biden', 'Jennifer Granholm', 'DOE', 'Granholm', 'Obama', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Korosec1:00', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/o7vShlITw4,2021-01-11T07:03:44,Vision Fund backs Chinese fitness app Keep in $360 million round,"['As Chinese fitness class provider Keep continues to diversify its offerings to include Peloton-like bikes and health-conscious snacks, among other things, it’s bringing in new investors to fund its ambitions.On Monday, Keep said it has recently closed a Series F financing round of $360 million led by SoftBank Vision Fund. Hillhouse Capital and Coatue Management participated in the round, as well as existing investors GGV Capital, Tencent, 5Y Capital, Jeneration Capital and Bertelsmann Asia Investments.The latest fundraise values the six-year-old startup at about $2 billion post-money, people with knowledge told TechCrunch. Keep said it currently has no plans to go public, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.Keep started out in 2014 by providing at-home workout videos and signed up 100 million users within three years. As of late, it has served over 300 million users, the company claims. It has over time fostered an ecosystem of fitness influencers who give live classes to students via videos and now runs a team of course designers, streaming coaches and operational staff dedicated to its video-streaming business.The company said its main revenue driver is membership fees from the 10 million users who receive personalized services. It’s also expanding its consumer product line. Last year, for instance, the firm introduced an internet-connected stationary bike that comes with video instructions like Peloton. It’s also rolled out apparel, treadmills and smart wristbands.The company launched foreign versions of its Keep app in 2018 as it took aim at the overseas home fitness market. It was posting diligently on Western social networks including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter up until the spring of 2019.According to Keep, the purpose of the latest funding is to let it continue doing what it has focused on in recent years: improving services and products for users and serving fitness professionals against a backdrop of the Chinese government’s campaign for “national fitness.”“We believe fitness has become an indispensable part of Chinese people’s everyday life as their income rises and health awareness grows,” said Eric Chen, managing partner at SoftBank Vision Fund.YC-backed LemonBox raises $2.5M bringing vitamins to Chinese millennials\xa0']",according to a report in The Wall Street Journal,"['Vision Fund', 'Keep', 'NavigationClose ScreenVision Fund', 'Keep', 'Liao@ritacyliao / 8:03 AM', 'Peloton', 'Keep', 'SoftBank Vision Fund', 'Hillhouse Capital', 'Coatue Management', 'GGV Capital, Tencent', 'Bertelsmann Asia Investments', 'Peloton', 'Keep', 'Instagram', 'Eric Chen', 'SoftBank Vision Fund', 'LemonBox', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Vision FundVision Fund', 'Keep', 'Liao8:03 AM', 'Peloton', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/RSj1HVaqrC,2021-01-11T05:12:32,China’s search giant Baidu to set up an EV-making venture,"['China’s search giant Baidu is extending its car ambitions from mere software to production. The company said Monday that it will set up a company to produce electric vehicles with the help of Chinese automaker Geely. Baidu, a dominant player in China’s internet-search market for the last decade or so, will provide smart driving technologies while Geely, which has an impending merger with Sweden’s Volvo, will be in charge of car design and manufacturing.The move marks the latest company in China’s internet industry to enter the EV space. In November, news arrived that Alibaba and Chinese state-owned carmaker SAIC Motor had joined hands to produce electric cars. Ride-share company Didi and EV maker BYD co-developed a model for ride-hailing, which is already attracting customers like Ideanomics. Meanwhile, the stocks of China’s Tesla challengers, such as Xpeng, Li Auto and NIO, have been in a steady uptrend over the past year.Baidu’s car push is part of its effort to diversify a business relying on search advertising revenue. New media platforms such as ByteDance’s Toutiao news aggregator and short-video app Douyin come with their own search feature and have gradually eroded the share of traditional search engines like Baidu. Short video services have emerged as the second-most popular channel for internet search in China, trailing after web search engines and coming ahead of social networks and e-commerce, data analytics firm Jiguang shows.Baidu has been working aggressively on autonomous driving since 2017. Its Apollo ecosystem, which is billed as “an Android for smart driving,” has accumulated over a hundred manufacturing and supplier partners. Baidu has also been busy testing autonomous driving and recently rolled out a robotaxi fleet.The new venture will operate as a Baidu subsidiary where Geely will serve as a strategic partner and Baidu units like Apollo and Baidu Maps will contribute capabilities. The firm will cover the entire industrial chain, including vehicle design, research and development, manufacturing, sales, and service.It’s unclear how Baidu’s tie-up with Geely will affect Apollo’s operation, though Baidu promised in its announcement that it will “uphold its spirit of open collaboration across the AI technology industry, striving to work closely with its ecosystem partners to advance the new wave of intelligent transformation.”“At Baidu, we have long believed in the future of intelligent driving and have over the past decade invested heavily in AI to build a portfolio of world-class self-driving services,” said Robin Li, co-founder and chief executive officer of Baidu.“We believe that by combining Baidu’s expertise in smart transportation, connected vehicles and autonomous driving with Geely’s expertise as a leading automobile and EV manufacturer, the new partnership will pave the way for future passenger vehicles.”Alibaba vies for a piece of China’s booming EV market']",the Original Content podcast,"['Baidu', 'EV', 'NavigationClose', 'Baidu', 'EV', 'Baidu', 'Baidu', 'Sweden’s Volvo', 'EV', 'SAIC Motor', 'Didi', 'EV', 'BYD', 'Ideanomics', 'NIO', 'ByteDance’s Toutiao', 'Douyin', 'Baidu', 'Baidu', 'Apollo', 'Android', 'Baidu', 'Baidu', 'Baidu', 'Apollo', 'Apollo’s', 'Baidu', 'AI', 'AI', 'Robin Li', 'Baidu', 'Baidu', 'EV', 'EV', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Baidu', 'EV', 'Liao6:12 AM', 'Baidu', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/lzXqtVAR9H,2021-01-11T02:56:38,San Francisco police are prepping for a pro-Trump rally at Twitter headquarters,"['San Francisco police are preparing for a pro-Trump protest at Twitter’s headquarters, a building which has been essentially abandoned since the start of the pandemic last year, with most Twitter employees working remotely.The potential protest comes days after Twitter banned the president from using its service — his favorite form of communication to millions of followers — following what the company called his continued incitements to violence in the wake of the January 6 assault on the Capitol last week by a mob of his followers.“The San Francisco Police Department is aware of the possibility of a demonstration on the 1300 block of Market Street (Twitter) tomorrow, Monday January 11, 2021. SFPD has been in contact with representatives from Twitter. We will have sufficient resources available to respond to any demonstrations as well as calls for service citywide,” a police department spokesperson wrote in an email. “The San Francisco Police Department is committed to facilitating the public’s right to First Amendment expressions of free speech. We ask that everyone exercising their First Amendment rights be considerate, respectful, and mindful of the safety of others.”The San Francisco Chronicle, which first reported the preparations from SF police, noted that posts on a popular internet forum for Trump supporters who have relocated from Reddit called for the president’s adherents to protest his Twitter ban outside of the company’s headquarters on Monday.Twitter is one of several tech companies to deplatform the president and many of his supporters in the wake of the riot at the Capitol on Wednesday.At this point, most of the biggest names in tech have pledged to deny service to the President for what they said was his incitement to violence in the wake of the Capitol hill raid that left five people dead — including a Capitol Police officer.\xa0']",,"['pro-Trump', 'NavigationClose', 'pro-Trump', 'Justin Sullivan/Getty Images / Getty ImagesSan Francisco', 'pro-Trump', 'Twitter’s', 'Twitter', 'Capitol', 'San Francisco Police Department', 'The San Francisco Police Department', 'San Francisco Chronicle', 'Trump', 'Capitol', 'Capitol Police', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy', 'pro-Trump', 'pro-Trump', 'Twitter’s', 'Twit', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Returning investors SoftBank Ventures Asia, Insignia Ventures and Y Combinator also participated in the round, which was made in two closes.Founded in 2019 by chief executive officer Anderson Sumarli and chief operating officer Yada Piyajomkwan, Ajaib Group focuses on millennials and first-time investors, and currently claims one million monthly users. It has now raised a total of $27 million, including a $2 million seed round in 2019.Stock investment has a very low penetration rate in Indonesia, with only about 1.6 million capital market investors in the country, or less than 1% of its population (in comparison, about 55% of Americans own stocks, according to Gallup data).The very low penetration rate, coupled with growing interest in the capital market among retail investors during the pandemic, has spurred VC interest in online investment platforms, especially ones that focus on millennials. Last week, Indonesian investment app Bibit announced a $30 million growth round led by Sequoia Capital India, while another online investment platform, Bareksa, confirmed an undisclosed Series B from payment app OVO last year.Indonesian robo-advisor app Bibit raises $30 million led by Sequoia Capital IndiaAjaib Group’s founders said it differentiates as a low-fee stock trading platform that also offers mutual funds for diversification. Bibit is a robo-advisor for mutual funds, while Bareksa is a mutual fund marketplace.In an email, Sumarli and Piyajomkwan told TechCrunch that the stock investment rate is low in Indonesia because it is typically done by high net-worth individuals who use offline brokers and can afford high commissions. Ajaib Group was launched in 2019 after Sumarli became frustrated by the lack of investment platforms in Indonesia where he could also learn about stock trading.Inspired by companies like Robinhood in the United States and XP Investimentos in Brazil, Ajaib Group was created to be a mobile-first stock-trading platform, with no offline brokers or branches. It appeals to first-time investors and millennials with a simple user interface, in-app education features and a community where people can share investment ideas and low fees.Since people prefer to invest small amounts when trying out the app for the first time, Ajaib requires no minimums to open a brokerage account. Piyajomkwan said, “We typically see investors triple their investment amount within the second month of investing with Ajaib.”Ajaib Group’s platform now includes Ajaib Sekuritas for stock trading and Ajaib Reksadana for mutual funds. The company says that Ajaib Sekuritas became the fifth-largest stock brokerage in Indonesia by number of trades just seven months after it launched in June 2020.The Indonesian government and Indonesia Stock Exchange have launched initiatives to encourage more stock investing. Some of Ajaib Group’s Series A will be used for its #MentorInvestai campaign, which works with the government to educate millennials about investing and financial planning. The round will also be spent on expanding Ajaib’s tech infrastructure and products, and to hire more engineers.Ajaib may eventually expand into other Southeast Asian markets, but for the near future, it sees plenty of opportunity in Indonesia. “Ajaib was built with regional aspiration, having two founders from the two biggest capital markets in Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Thailand,” Piyajomkwan said. “But for the immediate term, we are focused on Indonesia as investment penetration is still low and there are many more millennial investors we can serve.”With a 2021 IPO in the cards, what do we know about Robinhood’s Q3 performance?\xa0']",,"['Horizons Venture', 'NavigationClose ScreenIndonesian', 'Horizons Venture', 'Alpha JWCCatherine Shu@catherineshu /', 'window)Ajaib Group', 'Horizons Ventures', 'Li Ka-Shing', 'Alpha JWC', 'SoftBank Ventures Asia', 'Insignia Ventures', 'Anderson Sumarli', 'Yada Piyajomkwan', 'Ajaib Group', 'Gallup', 'VC', 'Bibit', 'Sequoia Capital India', 'Bareksa', 'OVO', 'Bibit', 'Sequoia Capital IndiaAjaib Group’s', 'Bareksa', 'Piyajomkwan', 'Ajaib Group', 'XP Investimentos', 'Ajaib Group', 'Piyajomkwan', '”Ajaib Group’s', 'Ajaib Sekuritas', 'Ajaib Sekuritas', 'Indonesia Stock Exchange', 'Ajaib Group’s', 'Piyajomkwan', 'Robinhood’s Q3', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings &', 'AsiaIndonesian', 'Horizons Venture', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/X3tm1YcXHN,2021-01-11T00:17:34,Stripe reportedly joins the tech platforms booting President Trump from their services,"['It might be easier at this point to ask which tech platforms President Donald Trump can still use.Payment-processing company Stripe is the latest tech company to kick Donald Trump off of its platform, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.That means the president’s campaign website and online fundraising arms will no longer have access to the payment processor’s services, cutting off the Trump campaign from receiving donations.Sources told the Journal that the reason for the company’s decision was the violation of company policies against encouraging violence.The move comes as the president has remained largely silent through the official channels at his disposal in the wake of last week’s riot at the Capitol building.While Trump has been silent, technology companies have been busy repudiating the president’s support by cutting off access to a range of services.The deplatforming of President TrumpThe deplatforming of the president has effectively removed Trump from all social media outlets including Snap, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Spotify and TikTok.The technology companies that power most financial transactions online have also blocked the president. Shopify and PayPal were the first to take action against the extremists among President Trump supporters who participated in the riot.As we wrote earlier this week, PayPal has been\xa0deactivating the accounts of some groups of Trump supporters who were using the money-transfer fintech to coordinate payments to underwrite the rioters’ actions on Capitol Hill.The company has actually been actively taking steps against far-right activists for a while. After the Charlottesville protests and subsequent rioting in 2017, the company banned a spate of far-right organizations. These bans have so far not extended directly to the president himself from what TechCrunch can glean.On Thursday, Shopify announced that it was removing the storefronts for both the Trump campaign and Trump’s personal brand. That’s an evolution on policy for the company,\xa0which years ago said that it would not moderate its platform, but in recent years has removed some controversial stores, such as\xa0some right-wing shops in 2018.Now, Stripe has joined the actions against the president, cutting off a lucrative source of income for his political operations.As the Journal reported, the Trump campaign launched a fundraising blitz to raise money for the slew of lawsuits that the president brought against states around the country. The lawsuits were almost all defeated, but the effort did bring in hundreds of millions of dollars for the Republican party.\xa0']",these ad giants can see,"['Trump', 'NavigationClose ScreenStripe', 'Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'Trump', 'Journal', 'TrumpThe', 'Trump', 'Snap', 'Pinterest', 'Spotify', 'TikTok', 'PayPal', 'Trump', 'PayPal', 'Trump', 'Capitol Hill', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'Journal', 'Trump', 'the Republican party', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy', 'Riotdonald trumpFacebookPayPalShopifystripetechnologyStripe', 'Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'Donald Trump', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/pchPJtGoIo,2021-01-10T18:12:31,"Original Content podcast: Despite some odd choices, ‘The Undoing’ lays out a satisfying mystery","['The HBO miniseries “The Undoing” wrapped up back in November, but the hosts of the Original Content podcast took advantage of the holidays to get caught up.Based on a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz, “The Undoing” tells the story of Grace Fraser (played by Nicole Kidman), a Manhattan psychologist whose husband Jonathan (Hugh Grant) is accused of a brutal murder. As the trial turns into a media spectacle, Grace tries to navigate how she feels about her husband and to discover who else might be guilty of the crime.While Jordan had already watched the show as it aired, Anthony and Darrell were inspired to binge it thanks to an email from listener Michael Benedosso, who shared some amusing thoughts on Kidman’s wavering attempts at a New York accent — resulting in what he called “a world tour expressed via spoken word.”We agreed that Kidman’s accent left a lot to be desired, and that her performance often felt a bit oblique (the latter, at least, was probably intentional).We had other quibbles. For one thing, although the cast is relatively diverse, the story spends most of its time on the wealthy white family at its center, as their wealthy white friends. And there were perhaps a few too many red herrings that didn’t lead anywhere interesting.Still, we were pretty satisfied in the end. With only six episodes and plenty of plot twists, there was really no time to get bored, and we were particularly impressed by Grant’s performance as Jonathan, as well as Noah Jupe as the Frasers’ adolescent son Henry and Noma Dumezweni as Jonathan’s steely lawyer Haley.Before reviewing he show, we also discussed the recent launch of the Discovery+ streaming service.You can listen to our review in the player below, subscribe using Apple Podcasts\xa0or find us in your podcast player of choice.

https://t.co/0RctytK2Qj,2021-01-10T14:00:39,Lenovo launches AR glasses for enterprise,"['Lenovo seems to have gotten the memo that the real money in the augmented reality space is going to be made in enterprise. Ahead of tomorrow’s CES kick off, the hardware company announced the impending arrival of the ThinkReality A3, a pair of enterprise AR glasses that look to follow the lead set by companies like Epson and Microsoft.The glasses are set to arrive at some point in the middle of the year. No word from Lenovo on pricing — which isn’t entirely surprising for an enterprise-only device. The headset sports a 1080p resolution, powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR1 chip. A pair of fish-eye cameras provide motion tracking, while an eight-megapixel RGB camera grabs video for remote use.Image Credits: LenovoThe device is designed to tether to a PC or a handful of Motorola (owned by Lenovo) phones via USB-C. The glasses follow the announcement of the ThinkReality A6 head-mounted display, which offers a more traditional form factor (insofar as there is a traditional form factor for AR, I suppose).“For use in scenarios from factory floors and laboratories to busy retail and hospitality spaces, certified turnkey applications on the Think Reality platform powers remote assistance, guided workflows, and 3D visualization,” the company writes. “Now, industrial workers have a light, flexible, and scalable set of smart glasses to increase productivity and safety while decreasing error rates in daily tasks.”Clearly Lenovo thinks the immediate future for AR is in the enterprise space. The company has dabbled with it a bit in the consumer space with products like the Star Wars Jedi Challenges headset, but for now at least, that feels like something of a one-off.']",he had no intention to return to the site,"['Lenovo', 'AR', 'NavigationClose', 'AR', 'LenovoLenovo', 'CES', 'AR', 'Epson', 'Microsoft', 'Lenovo', 'Snapdragon XR1', 'LenovoThe', 'Motorola', 'Lenovo', 'AR', '3D', 'Lenovo', 'AR', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkCopy Share', 'realityCESCES', 'AR', 'CES', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

Of course, this year is going to be different (to be honest, even looking at that lead image makes me uneasy). For the first time ever, CES is going all-virtual – but as usual, TechCrunch will be around to (virtually) cover it. The new format offers some unique challenges and opportunities, and we’re (virtually) here for it.This year, we’re taking a different approach to help sort the signal from the noise. For past events, we’ve issued a similar form to find unique and interesting companies for our stage. While we don’t have a stage (or booth or physical presence of any sort) this year, we’re still looking to talk to as many great companies as possible.Getting noticed at a show the size and scope of CES is difficult even in normal years – and that difficultly is likely to only be compounded for many smaller startups in this new all-digital format.

https://t.co/P8BU65QYIc,2021-01-10T12:00:19,These 6 browser extensions will protect your privacy online,"['The internet is not a private place. Ads try to learn as much about you to sell your information to the highest bidder. Emails know when you open them and which links you click. And some of the biggest internet snoops, like Facebook and Amazon, follow you from site to site as you browse the web.But it doesn’t have to be like that. We’ve tried and tested six browser extensions that will immediately improve your privacy online by blocking most of the invisible ads and trackers.These extensions won’t block every kind of snooping, but they will vastly reduce your exposure to most of the efforts to track your internet activity. You might not care that advertisers collect your data to learn your tastes and interests to serve you targeted ads. But you might care that these ad giants can see which medical conditions you’re looking up and what private purchases you’re making.By blocking these hidden trackers from loading, websites can’t collect as much information about you. Plus by dropping the unnecessary bulk, some websites will load faster. The tradeoff is that some websites might not load properly or refuse to let you in if you don’t let them track you. You can toggle the extensions on and off as needed, or you could ask yourself if the website was that good to begin with and could you not just find what you were looking for somewhere else?HTTPS EverywhereWe’re pretty much hardwired to look for that little green lock in our browser to tell us a website was loaded over an HTTPS-encrypted connection. That means the websites you open haven’t been hijacked or modified by an attacker before it loaded and that anything you submit to that website can’t be seen by anyone other than the website. HTTPS Everywhere is a browser extension made by the nonprofit internet group the Electronic Frontier Foundation that automatically loads websites over HTTPS where it’s offered and allows you to block the minority of websites that don’t support HTTPS. The extension is supported by most browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera.Privacy BadgerAnother extension developed by the EFF, Privacy Badger is one of the best all-in-one extensions for blocking invisible third-party trackers on websites. This extension looks at all the components of a web page and learns which ones track you from website to website and then blocks them from loading in the browser. Privacy Badger also learns as you travel the web, so it gets better over time. And it requires no effort or configuration to work, just install it and leave it to it. The extension is available on most major browsers.uBlock OriginAds are what keeps the internet free, but often at the expense of your personal information. Ads try to learn as much about you\xa0— usually by watching your browsing activity and following you across the web — so that they can target you with ads you’re more likely to click on. Ad blockers stop them in their tracks by blocking ads from loading, but also the tracking code that comes with it.uBlock Origin is a lightweight, simple but effective, and widely trusted ad blocker used by millions of people, but it also has a ton of granularity and customizability for the more advanced user. (Be careful with impersonators: there are plenty of ad blockers that aren’t as trusted that use a similar name.) And if you feel bad about the sites that rely on ads for revenue (including us!), consider a subscription to the site instead. After all, a free web that relies on ad tracking to make money is what got us into this privacy nightmare to begin with.uBlock Origin works in Chrome, Firefox\xa0and Edge\xa0and the extension is open-source so anyone can look at how it works.PixelBlock and ClearURLsIf you thought hidden trackers in websites were bad, wait until you learn about what’s lurking in your emails. Most emails from brand names come with tiny, often invisible pixels that alerts the sender when you’ve opened them. PixelBlock is a simple extension for Chrome browsers that simply blocks these hidden email open trackers from loading and working. Every time it detects a tracker, it displays a small red eye in your inbox so you know.Most of these same emails also come with tracking links that alerts the sender which links you click. ClearURLs, available for Chrome, Firefox and Edge, sits in your browser and silently removes the tracking junk from every link in your browser and your inbox. That means ClearURLs needs more access to your browser’s data than most of these extensions, but its makers explain why in the documentation.Firefox Multi-Account ContainersAnd an honorary mention for Firefox users, who can take advantage of Multi-Account Containers, built by the browser maker itself to help you isolate your browsing activity. That means you can have one container full of your work tabs in your browser, and another container with all of your personal tabs, saving you from having to use multiple browsers. Containers also keep your private personal browsing separate from your work browsing activity. It also means you can put sites like Facebook or Google in a container, making it far more difficult for them to see which websites you visit and understand your tastes and interests. Containers are easy to use and customizable.Cybersecurity 101: How to browse the web securely and privately']",the newest episode of TC Mixtape,"['NavigationClose', 'Amazon', 'HTTPS', 'the Electronic Frontier Foundation', 'HTTPS', 'Chrome', 'Edge', 'Opera', 'EFF', 'Privacy Badger', 'Privacy Badger', 'OriginAds', 'PixelBlock', 'PixelBlock', 'Chrome', 'Edge', 'ClearURLs', 'Firefox Multi', 'Multi-Account Containers', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/OKQOvRfTox,2021-01-10T03:07:31,Amazon Web Services gives Parler 24-hour notice that it will suspend services to the company,"['Parler is at risk of disappearing, just as the social media network popular among conservatives was reaching new heights of popularity in the wake of President Donald Trump’s ban from all major tech social platforms.Amazon Web Services, which provides backend cloud services, has informed Parler that it intends to cut ties with the company in the next 24 hours, according to a report in BuzzFeed News.\xa0Parler’s application is built on top of AWS infrastructure, services that are critical for the operation of its platform. Earlier today, Apple announced that it was following Google in blocking the app from its App Store, citing a lack of content moderation.Parler, whose fortunes have soared as users upset at the President’s silencing on mainstream social media outlets flocked to the service, is now another site of contention in the struggle over the limits of free speech and accountability online.Parler CEO John Matze said that the platform would be offline for at least a week, as “they rebuild from scratch” in response to AWS’ communications. Some Parler users, as captured in screenshots shared on Twitter, seemed to respond with vague intentions to violently attack AWS data centers, perhaps proving Amazon’s point in the process.In the wake of the riots at the Capitol on Wednesday and a purge of accounts accused of inciting violence on Twitter and Facebook, Parler had become the home for a raft of radical voices calling for armed “Patriots” to commit violence at the nation’s capitol and statehouses around the country.Most recently, conservative militants on the site had been calling for “Patriots” to amplify the events of January 6 with a march on Washington DC with weapons on January 19.Even as pressure was came from Apple and Amazon, whose employees had called for the suspension of services with the company, Parler was taking steps to moderate posts on its platform.The company acknowledged that it had removed some posts from Trump supporter Lin Wood, who had called for the execution of Vice President Mike Pence in a series of proclamations on the company’s site.Over the past few months, Republican lawmakers including\xa0Sen. Ted Cruz\xa0and\xa0Congressman Devin Nunes\xa0— along with conservative firebrands like Wood have found a home on the platform, where they can share conspiracy theories with abandon.In an email quoted by BuzzFeed News, Amazon Web Services’ Trust and Safety Team told Parler’s chief policy officer, Amy Peikoff that calls for violence that were spreading across Parler’s platform violated its terms of service. The company’s team also said that Parler’s plan to use volunteers to moderate content on the platform would not prove effective, according to BuzzFeed.“Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service,” BuzzFeed reported the email as saying.Here’s Amazon’s letter to Parler in full.Dear Amy,Thank you for speaking with us earlier today.As we discussed on the phone yesterday and this morning, we remain troubled by the repeated violations of our terms of service. Over the past several weeks, we’ve reported 98 examples to Parler of posts that clearly encourage and incite violence. Here are a few examples below from the ones we’ve sent previously: [See images above.]Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service. It also seems that Parler is still trying to determine its position on content moderation. You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency. Your CEO recently stated publicly that he doesn’t “feel responsible for any of this, and neither should the platform.” This morning, you shared that you have a plan to more proactively moderate violent content, but plan to do so manually with volunteers. It’s our view that this nascent plan to use volunteers to promptly identify and remove dangerous content will not work in light of the rapidly growing number of violent posts. This is further demonstrated by the fact that you still have not taken down much of the content that we’ve sent you. Given the unfortunate events that transpired this past week in Washington, D.C., there is serious risk that this type of content will further incite violence.AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site. However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others. Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler’s account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST. We will ensure that all of your data is preserved for you to migrate to your own servers, and will work with you as best as we can to help your migration.– AWS Trust & Safety TeamUpdate January 9, 2020: Added a note about Parler users’ reactions.']",the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch,"['Amazon Web Services', 'Parler', 'NavigationClose', 'Parler', 'Danny Crichton', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Donald Trump', 'Amazon Web Services', 'Parler', 'BuzzFeed News', 'Parler’s', 'Apple', 'App Store', 'John Matze', 'Parler', 'Amazon’s', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'Trump', 'Lin Wood', 'Mike Pence', 'Ted Cruz', 'Devin Nunes', 'Wood', 'BuzzFeed News', 'Amazon Web Services’ Trust and Safety Team', 'Parler’s', 'Amy Peikoff', 'Parler’s', 'Parler’s', 'BuzzFeed', 'Parler', 'Amazon’s', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler’s', 'Parler', 'Parler’s', 'PST', 'AWS Trust & Safety', 'Parler', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Parler', 'Danny Crichton4:07 AM', 'Donald Trump', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/ajNq6n4l20,2021-01-10T00:50:01,Apple suspends Parler from App Store,"['Apple confirmed that it has suspended the conservative social media app Parler from the App Store, shortly after Google banned it from Google Play. The app, which became a home to Trump supporters and several high-profile conservatives in the days leading up to the Capitol riots, had been operating in violation of Apple’s rules.The company tells TechCrunch:We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity. Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues.In the wake of its decision Apple sent Parler’s developers the following note:To the developers of the Parler app,Thank you for your response regarding dangerous and harmful content on Parler. We have determined that the measures you describe are inadequate to address the proliferation of dangerous and objectionable content on your app.Parler has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity, and is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.In your response, you referenced that Parler has been taking this content “very seriously for weeks.” However, the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 – Safety – Objectionable Content.Your response also references a moderation plan “for the time being,” which does not meet the ongoing requirements in Guideline 1.2 – Safety – User Generated content. While there is no perfect system to prevent all dangerous or hateful user content, apps are required to have robust content moderation plans in place to proactively and effectively address these issues. A temporary “task force” is not a sufficient response given the widespread proliferation of harmful content.For these reasons, your app will be removed from the App Store until we receive an update that is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines and you have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.Regards,App Review BoardConservative commentator and Parler investor Dan Bongino posted about Apple’s decision on the site:The tech tyrants at Apple have pulled the app from their App Store. Apple is no different than the Chinese communist party in their preference for totalitarian thought control. I’m proud of the remaining liberty-loving people of this great country. And I’m embarrassed, and horrified by the tech totalitarians who’ve taken control of it.Bongino was among those recently suspended from Twitter. He noted, however, that he had no intention to return to the site.While Parler is no longer available through the store at present, it seems it will still be available to access for those who have already downloaded it. As The New York Times noted earlier this week,If Apple pulls Parler from the App Store, people would not be able to download the app to their iPhones or iPads. People who had already downloaded the Parler iPhone app would still be able to use it, but the company would not be able to update the app, meaning it would eventually be rendered obsolete as Apple updated the iPhone software.But Parler’s future remains more uncertain than most, as there’s a growing push inside Amazon to pull the plug on Parler, too.The deplatforming of President TrumpThe news comes shortly after Google banned it from Google Play. The app, which became a home to Trump supporters and several high-profile conservatives in the days leading up the Capitol riots, had been operating in violation of Apple’s rules, we understand. Apple’s App Store guidelines require apps hosting user-generated content to have moderation policies to remove content that incites violence.Despite these policies, neither Apple nor Google had taken action to remove Parler in prior weeks, even though Trump supporters and other far-right users had used the app to call for violence\xa0and organize their plans to storm the Capitol. The insurrection left five people dead, over 50 police officers injured, and more than a dozen facing federal charges, in addition to the growing number of arrests emerging as suspects are identified.Image Credits: Parler via the App StoreBuzzFeed News on Friday reported Parler had received a letter from Apple which warned that the app would be removed from the App Store within 24 hours, unless the company submitted a content moderation improvement plan.Apple’s notice read:We have received numerous complaints regarding objectionable content in your Parler service, accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington D.C. on January 6, 2021 that led (among other things) to loss of life, numerous injuries, and the destruction of property. The app also appears to continue to be used to plan and facilitate yet further illegal and dangerous activities.(TechCrunch additionally confirmed BuzzFeed’s reporting.)Parler CEO John Matze posted about Apple’s ultimatum to his own Parler account, saying he would not cave to “those authoritarians who hate free speech.” Earlier today, it was noted that the service reportedly removed a post from Trump associate Lin Wood over calls for violence against Vice President, Mike Pence.Parler jumps to No. 1 on App Store after Facebook and Twitter ban TrumpAhead of its removal, Parler had ranked No. 1 in News on the iPhone App Store and No. 13 Overall, according to data from App Annie. On Friday, it was ranking as high as No. 1, at times, on the iPhone’s Top Charts of free non-game apps, though final data was not available.Image Credits: App AnnieCurrently, the app is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS), but it appears to be in violation of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy which could serve as grounds for its removal.The collective action of tech company employees is playing a key role in some of the decisions being made regarding Trump and his supporters’ access to platforms to communicate and organize in the days following the Capitol riots. According to The Washington Post, for example, over 350 Twitter employees signed a letter urging CEO Jack Dorsey and other execs to permanently suspend Trump’s account before the company followed through.The deplatforming of President TrumpTrump has now lost his ability to post to Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Twitch, to name a few. Meanwhile, Parler’s removal from both app stores will limit the reach of the more radical and violent Trump supporter movement to some extent, forcing them to more obscure corners of the web. However, many argue these measures have come too late, as the damage to not only Capitol, but to the nation’s psyche as whole, has already been done.We have reached out to Parler for additional comment.Parler reportedly removed posts by Trump affiliate Lin Wood calling for execution of VP Mike Pence']",Sign up here.,"['Apple', 'Parler', 'App Store', 'NavigationClose ScreenApple', 'Parler', 'App StoreSarah Perez', 'Brian Heater', 'NGAN', 'Getty Images / Getty ImagesApple', 'Parler', 'Google', 'Trump', 'Capitol', 'Apple’s', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Apple', 'Parler’s', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'the App Store Review Guidelines', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Guideline', 'the App Store Review Guidelines', 'App Review BoardConservative', 'Parler', 'Dan Bongino', 'Apple’s', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Bongino', 'Parler', 'The New York Times', 'Apple', 'iPhones', 'iPads', 'Parler', 'Apple', 'iPhone', 'Parler’s', 'Amazon', 'Parler', 'TrumpThe', 'Google', 'Trump', 'Capitol', 'Apple’s', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Google', 'Parler', 'Trump', 'Parler', 'Apple', 'Apple’s', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'BuzzFeed', 'John Matze', 'Apple', 'Trump', 'Lin Wood', 'Mike Pence', 'TrumpAhead', 'Parler', 'App Annie', 'the iPhone’s Top Charts', 'App AnnieCurrently', 'Amazon Web Services', 'Trump', 'Capitol', 'The Washington Post', 'Jack Dorsey', 'Trump’s', 'TrumpTrump', 'Snapchat', 'Twitch', 'Parler’s', 'Trump', 'Capitol', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Trump', 'Lin Wood', 'Mike PenceclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'PlayparlerApple', 'Parler', 'App StoreSarah Perez', 'Brian Heater1:50', 'Parler', 'Google', 'Trump', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/FtBNP5dzAw,2021-01-09T23:24:21,Parler reportedly removed posts by Trump affiliate Lin Wood calling for execution of VP Mike Pence,"['It seems that even the “free speech” social network Parler has its limits.The social network that has attracted scores of conservative commentators because of its commitment to free speech has taken down several posts from Trump affiliate Lin Wood, according to a report in Mediaite.In one of the posts removed from the social media platform, Wood called for the execution of Vice President Mike Pence.Wood adds on Parler that he is currently serving a Twitter suspension. pic.twitter.com/JqvF0VM2gu— Zachary Petrizzo (@ZTPetrizzo) January 7, 2021In a statement to Mediaite, Parler chief executive John Matze confirmed that the service had taken action against Wood’s posts to the platform.“Yes, some of his parleys that violated our rules were taken down,” Matze told Mediaite. “Including the ones you are talking about.”The move from Parler is significant because it would mark one of the first instances of a high profile conservative figure having their content removed from the service.Parler, despite its reputation as a social platform dedicated to free speech, does have some rules governing content.And, as Mediaite flagged, the posts from Wood likely ran afoul of a rule in the company’s terms of service that states “reported parleys, comments, or messages sent using our service will be deemed a violation of these Guidelines if they contain: an explicit or implicit encouragement to use violence, or to commit a lawless action, such that: (a) the Parleyer intends his or her speech to result in the use of violence or lawless action, and (b) the imminent use of violence or lawless action is the likely result of the parley, comment, or message.”Wood, whose account remains active on Parler, had his Twitter account suspended on Thursday, as Forbes reported at the time.Twitter permanently bans President TrumpMeanwhile, the incitements to execute Pence seem to have been the animating factor for at least some of the rioters who stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday. Reuters Photo News Editor Jim Bourg tweeted about hearing at least three different rioters hoping to “find Vice President Mike Pence and execute him by hanging him from a Capitol Hill tree as a traitor.”I heard at least 3 different rioters at the Capitol say that they hoped to find Vice President Mike Pence and execute him by hanging him from a Capitol Hill tree as a traitor. It was a common line being repeated. Many more were just talking about how the VP should be executed. https://t.co/fxHREouEWF— Jim Bourg (@jimbourg) January 8, 2021\xa0']",Parler,"['Parler', 'Trump', 'Lin Wood', 'Mike Pence', 'NavigationClose', 'Trump', 'Lin Wood', 'Mike PenceJonathan', 'Parler', 'Trump', 'Lin Wood', 'Wood', 'Mike Pence', 'Parler', 'Zachary Petrizzo', 'Parler', 'John Matze', 'Wood’s', 'Matze', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Forbes', 'TrumpMeanwhile', 'Pence', 'Reuters Photo News', 'Jim Bourg', 'Mike Pence', 'Capitol Hill', 'Mike Pence', 'Capitol Hill', 'Jim Bourg', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'PresidentParler', 'Trump', 'Lin Wood', 'Mike PenceJonathan Shieber12:24 AM', 'Parler', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/yUnHXhBsOl,2021-01-09T21:00:41,Human Capital: What’s next for Dr. Timnit Gebru,"['Congrats on surviving this wild first week of 2021. Outside all-things political, a few labor developments happened that are worth noting. Also, shortly before the mob of Trump supporters wreaked havoc on the U.S. Capitol, I caught up with Dr. Timnit Gebru, the prominent AI ethics researcher who said she was fired from Google last month for speaking out about diversity issues. Our full conversation will be available to listen to next Saturday on the newest episode of TC Mixtape, but I’ve included some snippets for y’all below.Sign up here to get Human Capital delivered straight to your inbox every Friday at 1 p.m. PT.\xa0Google, Alphabet workers unionizeA group of more than 200 Google and Alphabet workers announced the formation of the Alphabet Workers Union earlier this week. With the help of Communication Workers of America Union’s Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE-CWA), the union is open to both employees and contractors in the U.S. and Canada.Of the 690 workers who have signed on to support the union as of this weekend, they all committed to set aside 1% of their yearly compensation to go toward union dues. Those dues will be used to help compensate folks for lost wages in the event of a strike. The bulk of the workers who have signed on are mostly based in offices in the San Francisco Bay Area and one in Cambridge.To be clear, though, the Alphabet Workers Union is a bit untraditional. For the Alphabet union, the intent is not necessarily to be able to bargain with Alphabet-owned companies but to be able to work collectively toward common goals.Labor department issues filing ruling re: gig workersEarlier this week, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a final rule pertaining to gig workers. The rule, which goes into effect March 8, 2021, makes it easier for gig economy companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart to legally classify workers as independent contractors throughout the country.\xa0However, it remains to be seen if this rule will fully manifest under the new leadership of President-Elect Joe Biden, who is set to be inaugurated on Jan 20, 2021. According to the Wall Street Journal, Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki previously pointed to the labor rule as an example of regulation Biden could stop or delay on his inauguration day.\xa0Independent Drivers Guild Chicago formsRideshare drivers in Chicago recently teamed up with Independent Drivers Guild to launch a local branch of the drivers’ rights organization. IDG, which is affiliated with the Machinists Union, has historically advocated for the rights of rideshare drivers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.“IDG beat the odds to win higher pay and benefits for drivers in New York City and working together, we know we can do the same here in Chicago,” Steven Everett, a Chicago rideshare driver-organizer, said in a statement.What’s next for Dr. Timnit GebruMany of you are likely familiar with Dr. Timnit Gebru, but the TL;DR is that she recently left Google after speaking out about diversity issues in artificial intelligence. Google says Gebru resigned and it merely accepted her resignation, while Gebru says Google fired her.\xa0I caught up with Dr. Gebru on Wednesday to chat about what’s next for her, as well as some recent developments in tech’s labor struggles.On the Alphabet Workers Union:This is a combination of a lot of peoples work and frustration. And i think this is the only way because this is a way to give workers power, and so that they can be at the negotiating table, because right now, they don’t have power.[…] One thing I really appreciate about this union is that it’s all workers. It’s not just, you know, full time workers, it’s temp workers and full-time workers, which is extremely important because the tech industry is right now running on the backs of these contract workers who have zero security.”[…] What I worry about though, is that [Google has] been extremely aggressive with trying to union\xa0 bust and trying to stop these kinds of organizing — any type of organizing and now that it’s become something real, I think\xa0 they’re going to intensify their efforts, like a lot more in trying to stop this organizing from happening. And there are many well-known tactics to do this, right. This kind of like propaganda and kind of dividing and conquering and all that. So that’s my worry. And I think everybody needs to stay vigilant to make sure that that doesn’t happen.On fighting for severance:“I don’t know if I’m going to, you know, explain to you exactly what I’m thinking right now about that,” she said, adding that “I definitely have lawyers.”Obviously, what they did to me was wrong and I definitely want to, you know, take some sort of action but what that is is not necessarily crystal clear.On working at a tech company againPrior to joining Google, Dr. Gebru held roles at Apple and Microsoft. While, she still plans to work in the field of artificial intelligence ethics and work with Black in AI, Dr. Gebru said “it’s very hard for me to imagine joining a corporation right now.”I’m just sick of these institutions because you spend so much of your energy, fighting for simple things, just simple things that people don’t have any incentive to change.[…] I want to spend more time thinking about how we can have our own institutions rather than just you know, fighting these people over and over again. That’s my current thinking.Envisioning a firm or a non-profit that does what the ethical AI team at Google was doing under her leadership, but that’s not affiliated with any corporation.“We want to create technology that would also work for us, rather than just playing catch up,” she said. “So I think that’s the idea of Black in AI.”']",the weekly TechCrunch series,"['Timnit Gebru |', 'NavigationClose ScreenHuman Capital', 'Timnit GebruMegan', 'Kimberly White', 'Getty ImagesCongrats', 'Trump', 'Timnit Gebru', 'AI', 'Google', 'TC Mixtape', 'Human Capital', 'the Alphabet Workers Union', 'Communication Workers of America Union’s Campaign to Organize Digital Employees', 'the Alphabet Workers Union', 'the U.S. Department of Labor', 'Uber', 'DoorDash', 'Instacart', 'Joe Biden', 'the Wall Street Journal', 'Biden', 'Jen Psaki', 'Biden', 'Independent Drivers Guild', 'the Machinists Union', 'Steven Everett', 'Timnit GebruMany', 'Timnit Gebru', 'Gebru', 'Gebru', 'Gebru', 'the Alphabet Workers Union', 'Google', 'Gebru', 'Apple', 'Microsoft', 'Black', 'Gebru', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CapitalHuman Capital', 'Timnit GebruMegan Rose', 'Trump', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/RrEfpvB6KQ,2021-01-09T21:00:37,Bootstrapping to $80M ARR,"['Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Click here if you want it in your inbox every Saturday morning.Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.So much for a quiet start to the year.Any hopes of 2021 giving us respite from the turbulent waters of 2020 went splat, as the first week of the New Year was busy with venture capital deals (Divvy! Gtmhub!), IPO news (Affirm! Poshmark! Roblox!), SPAC news (SoFi! BuzzFeed!), and violence in the American capital. We’ll get to all of that in a minute, minus the political stuff as I don’t have the heart to scream again before the work week is over.Today we’re starting with two growth stories, one from a company that is nearing IPO scale, and the other from a startup that is just getting its feet underneath it after a product launch.We’ll start with Cloudinary, a media-focused software company that we covered in early 2020, when the bootstrapped company announced that it had reached $60 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR. I caught up with the private upstart again this week to check in on what it was like to bootstrap through a pandemic.Cloudinary co-founder and CEO Itai Lahan told TechCrunch that his company has reached $80 million ARR, or 33% growth during a very busy year. Not bad, right? But according to Lahan, Cloudinary had targeted a number over $90 million for the year. So what happened?Well, Cloudinary intentionally decelerated a little bit.Lahan walked TechCrunch through how Cloudinary dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an impact on parts of its customer base. Lahan and the rest of the company decided to slow down, he said, reducing the pace at which it was hiring, among other initiatives. The goal was to get the company through the pandemic, switch to remote work with its culture intact, he said.The Exchange is looking for startups between $35 million and $60 million ARR that are growing quickly and are willing to share performance metrics. Email in if that’s you. More on the project here.The gap between the company’s $80 million ARR result and its original goal was a mix of COVID-19’s commercial impact and the company’s own choices, Lahan said.When’s the last time I heard the CEO of a private technology company tell me that they were making conscious choices to slow their company down? I honestly don’t remember. Lahan had reasons, however, that went past not having recently raised $100 million or whatever. Instead, the company decided to exchange short-term financial growth for what the CEO described variously as long-term growth or sustainable growth.Lahan said that if Cloudinary focuses on its customers and employees over short-term financial goals, it will grow more in the next half-decade than it will if it decided to sprint as fast as it could today. One example of the choice to go a little slower in 2020? The company has around 285 people today, under its original plan to have around 320.Wild, right? This is all possible because Lahan and his team at once don’t have to answer to external investors with short, or medium-term time frames in mind for liquidity, and because Cloudinary makes secondary liquidity available to its workers, alleviating internal agitating for an IPO.Not that we would mind Cloudinary going public so we could dig into its numbers more deeply. It should cross $100 million ARR this year, so it’s nearly time to start sending it regular, annoying emails.Now on to our smaller company: OnJuno! If Cloudinary is nearly ready to go public, OnJuno is getting ready to think about a Series A. So it’s just a little bit younger.TechCrunch first spoke with OnJuno in December, right after it launched, trying to figure out why the world needed another neobank of sorts. According to co-founder Varun Deshpande, OnJuno is targeted at affluent individuals, while other neobanks have more traditionally targeted less-wealthy customers.OnJuno entices them with higher interest rates, and a focus on what Deshpande described as the more debit-focused Asian American community. How is it going? We checked back in with OnJuno, about three-and-a-half weeks after it launched. Per Deshpande, OnJuno expects to reach the $10 million assets under management (AUM) threshold shortly, with users bringing average deposits of $7,000 to $8,000. That’s a multiple of some other neobanks, the startup said.The fintech upstart said that it expects to reach $100 million AUM in the next two to three quarters, adding that around 80% of its users come from traditional banks. Let’s see how fast it can reach $25 million AUM, and if its deposit averages hold up.Now, venture rounds, IPOs news, and then — I am sorry — some SPAC news we need to discuss.Venture capitalDespite it being the first minutes and hours and days of 2021, so very much happened. To pick an example, we have now seen around a half dozen new unicorns born, with another group in the provisional camp.The pace of new unicorn creation feels exciting, but as we’re still too close to Q4 2020 for comfort, I don’t want to call this a trend yet. But as Divvy puts $165 million to work at a $1.6 billion valuation, Hinge Health blasts to a $3 billion valuation and Salesloft meets the mark and more, it’s been busy.On the slightly-smaller-but-still-very-interesting side of the VC coin, Bangalore-based Jumbotail picked up $14.2 million this week to help it pursue what we called “the opportunity to digitize neighborhood stores in the world’s second-largest internet market.” That actually sounds cool? And important?And in an even smaller round, Atlanta, Georgia-based Voxie raised a $6.7 million in Series A. Voxie “offers tools to help businesses automate and manage” their text message-based marketing. This shows how much space there still is in the software market for new startups. I would have bet you an espresso that we had tapped out the text messaging startup space three years ago. Nope!Coming up, some re-digs into startup clusters. After looking at how quickly startups building corporate-cards-and-software businesses are growing, we’re dipping back into software startups building OKR software. If that’s you, get your data in or be left out.IPOsZooming out from our regular coverage of IPOs, here’s what you need to know: Affirm and Poshmark are pursuing traditional IPOs at huge markups to their final private valuations. That means that the 2021 IPO market is kicking off like a mirror to the late-2020 IPO market. Expect some big pops in coming months for some companies you know by name.The other bit of news that matters is that Roblox has scrapped its IPO plans, raised an enormous brick of cash, and now intends to direct list. Why is a perfectly fine question to ask, and one that we tried to answer here.Takeaways? The IPO market will be active, and perhaps more diverse than expected in 2021. At least to start.SPACs (alas)While you are tired and bored of SPACs, and I am as well, they are actually doing things at last that we do care about. In brief to respect your time and sanity:BuzzFeed might go public via a SPAC. Our verdict: That shit’s bodacious and we want to see BuzzFeed News have as much loot as possible to keep up its critical reporting.SoFi might go public via a SPAC, you can read the investor deck here, which seems dumb. Why not just go public? But as Chamath is involved, this one is going to do a lot of press.Bustle could go public via a SPAC. Our verdict: Wait, really?Odds/EndsLots of venture capital funds raised capital, which we yammered about here on the podcast. But I wanted to throw one more into the mix: Transformation Capital, which put together a $500 million fund focused on digital health.The nice thing about thematic funds, like this and USV’s new climate fund, is that you actually know what they do. Which in the case of Transformation Capital, is investing “investing in commercial-stage digital health companies,” in its own words. Word.This is the second such fund from the group, which now has $800 million under management.

https://t.co/cpFVTUaEcE,2021-01-09T19:00:30,The next Zoom wants to be nothing like Zoom,"['Want this newsletter in your inbox every Saturday morning?\xa0Sign up here.In the past few months, there hasn’t been one conversation I’ve had about remote work that doesn’t include a mention of Hopin, a virtual events platform last valued at $2.1 billion.For a company only a little older than a year, Hopin has a wild growth story. It grew its ARR from $0 to $20 million in nine months. It scooped up two businesses to differentiate its business, including StreamYard for $250 million just this week. And its last financing round left the company’s valuation at $2.1 billion.Hopin’s growth amid Zoom’s fatigue is giving validation to a whole crop of remote-work-focused startups. I see startups in the category sitting in two camps: Either you’re betting that users want a more passive way to interact with video or you’re betting that users want a more active way to interact with video.This week, for example, I wrote about Rewatch, which creates internal private channels for startups to archive all their videoconferencing meetings. The company is essentially turning live meetings into transcribed documents that employees can sift through on their own time, shifting from synchronous to asynchronous.In contrast, I also covered Teamflow, a platform that wants to give a virtual space to companies to recreate the serendipity and productivity of an office. Unlike Rewatch, Teamflow thinks that employees want there to be more live moments in a distributed world.Both previously in-stealth companies cited Hopin as an example of the need for innovation around how we interact virtually. Rewatch and Teamflow, respectively, see Zoom as a plug-in or competitor – not inspiration.As I mentioned in this week’s podcast, it’s a dynamic I expect to play out even more over the next few months, as we evolve from a Zoom world to a Zoom alternative world. I want to hear from you, even if you disagree, about what companies in the remote work space should be on my radar. E-mail me at natasha.mascarenhas@techcrunch.com or tweet me @nmasc_ with companies you think should be on my remote-work radar.The power of platformThis week, the U.S. Capitol building was stormed by pro-Trump insurrectionists in a fatal riot.

It was going to be acquired by P&G after raising just $35 million in venture capital.Here’s our seed coverage of the startup.Etc: Direct-to-consumer brands are not happy. The failed deal is not-so-subtly signaling to DTC brands that there is a cap to their scale, at least in the FTC’s eyes. Government regulation and limited scale also could hurt VC interest in the category.The optimistic news is that VC funding might be falling out of favor with top D2C brands. Many product-based brands, as it turns out, are no longer interested in chasing venture capital, playing the “grow-at-all-costs” game and relinquishing partial control to investors, despite the pandemic and the uncertain circumstances many founders find themselves facing.Image Credits: BillieIPOs, a direct listing, and sky-high valuationsMy colleague Alex puts together a brilliant newsletter each week after his column, The Exchange.

https://t.co/pIQaytUI6O,2021-01-09T18:45:25,Parler jumps to No. 1 on App Store after Facebook and Twitter ban Trump,"['Users are surging on small, conservative, social media platforms after President Donald Trump’s ban from the world’s largest social networks, even as those platforms are seeing access throttled by the app marketplaces of tech’s biggest players.The social network, Parler, a network that mimics Twitter, is now the number one app in Apple’s app store and Gab, another conservative-backed service, claimed that it was seeing an explosion in the number of signups to its web-based platform as well.Parler saw approximately 210,000 installs globally on Friday 1/8, up 281% from approximately 55,000 on 1/7, according to data from the analytics service Sensor Tower. “In the U.S., the app saw approximately 182,000 first-time downloads on 1/8, up 355% from about 40,000 installs on 1/7. Since Wednesday, the app has seen approximately 268,000 installs from across U.S. app stores,” a press rep from Sensor Tower wrote in an email.Parler’s ballooning user base comes at a potentially perilous time for the company. It has already been removed from Google’s Play store and Apple is considering suspending the social media app as well if it does not add some content moderation features.Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly loomsBoth Parler and Gab have billed themselves as havens for free speech, with what’s perhaps the most lax content moderation online. In the past the two companies have left up content posted by an alleged Russian disinformation campaign, and allow users to traffic in conspiracy theories that other social media platforms have shut down.The expectation with these services is that users on the platforms are in charge of muting and blocking trolls or offensive content, but, by their nature, those who join these platforms will generally find themselves among like-minded users.Their user counts might be surging, but would-be adopters may soon have a hard time finding the services.On Friday night, Google said that it would be removing Parler from their Play Store immediately — suspending the app until the developers committed to a moderation and enforcement policy that could handle objectionable content on the platform.In a statement to TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said:“In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.“On Friday,\xa0Buzzfeed News\xa0reported that Parler had received a letter from Apple informing them that the app would be removed from the App Store within 24 hours unless the company submitted an update with a moderation improvement plan. Parler CEO John Matze confirmed the action from Apple in a post on his Parler account where he posted a screenshot of the notification from Apple.“We want to be clear that Parler is in fact responsible for all the user generated content present on your service and for ensuring that this content meets App Store requirements for the safety and protection of our users,” text from the screenshot reads. “We won’t distribute apps that present dangerous and harmful content.Parler is backed by the conservative billionaire heiress Rebekah Mercer, according to a November report in The Wall Street Journal. Founded in 2018, the service has experienced spikes in user adoption with every clash between more social media companies and the outgoing President Trump. In November, Parler boasted some 10 million users, according to the Journal.Users like Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo and the conservative talk show host Dan Bongino, a wildly popular figure on Facebook who is also an investor in Parler, have joined the platform. In the Journal article Bongino called the company “a collective middle finger to the tech tyrants.”It’s worth noting that Parler and Gab aren’t the only companies to see users numbers soar after the Trump bans. MeWe Network, OANN, Newsmax and Rumble have also seen adoption soar, according to data from the analytics company Apptopia.The company noted that Parler was the #1 app on the iOS app store for two days surging from 18th on Thursday and 592 on Wednesday. Overall, the app was the 10th most downloaded social media app in 2020 with 8.1 million new installs.“It is an event driven app though,” a company analyst noted. “After events like the election, BLM protests, Twitter first applying labels to Trump’s Tweets, we see bursts of downloads and usage but it will then drop off.”Sarah Perez and Lucas Matney contributed additional reporting to this article.\xa0\xa0']",digitize neighborhood stores,"['NavigationClose', 'TrumpJonathan', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Donald Trump', 'Parler', 'Apple’s', 'Gab', 'Sensor Tower', 'Parler’s', 'Google’s Play', 'Apple', 'Parler', 'Apple', 'Parler', 'Gab', 'Google', 'Parler', 'TechCrunch', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Parler', 'Apple', 'John Matze', 'Apple', 'Parler', 'Apple', 'Parler', 'App Store', 'Parler', 'Rebekah Mercer', 'The Wall Street Journal', 'Trump', 'Parler', 'Journal', 'Fox Business', 'Maria Bartiromo', 'Dan Bongino', 'Parler', 'Journal', 'Bongino', 'Parler', 'Gab', 'Trump', 'MeWe Network', 'OANN', 'Newsmax', 'Apptopia', 'Parler', 'BLM', 'Trump’s Tweets', '”Sarah Perez', 'Lucas Matney', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Riotceodonald trumpGabGoogleGoogle', 'Donald Trump', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/7MyCL32BJL,2021-01-09T17:09:26,"This Week in Apps: Social apps react to riots, Parler gets booted, FTC threatens regulation","[""Welcome back to This Week in\xa0Apps,\xa0the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.The app industry is as hot as ever, with\xa0a record 204 billion downloads and $120 billion in global consumer spend in 2019. Consumer spend also hit a record $112 billion across iOS and Android alone.Not including third-party Chinese app stores, iOS and Android users downloaded 130 billion apps in 2020. Due to COVID-19, time spent in apps jumped 25% year-over-year on Android.Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a \xa0$544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.Top StoriesSocial apps boot Trump following Capitol riotTo varying degrees, social apps had to quickly figure out where to draw the line on allowing Trump to continue to use their platforms this week, after his false claims about a rigged election led Trump supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, destroying property, stealing at least one computer, potentially gaining access to other unlocked computers and causing chaos that led to five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer who has now died of injuries sustained on duty.Decrypted: How bad was the US Capitol breach for cybersecurity?Social platforms, however, have been complicit in allowing these dangerous and radicalized groups to emerge in the first place. Facebook, for example, allowed StoptheSteal and Secession groups to organize using its platform. It also waited years to sweep the platform of QAnon groups, and then didn’t even finish the job — these disinformation networks remain live on the platform today. But even smaller gestures aimed at cleaning up the mess of a platform that prioritized ad dollars over safety led some Trump supporters to flee to other social media networks used by the far-right, such as Gab and Parler. There, they could post even more violent rhetoric without repercussions.Following the riot, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Trump would be banned from both Facebook and Instagram for two weeks. Twitter initially locked Trump’s account on Wednesday, then allowed him to return after deleting a few tweets, noting that another violation would result in permanent suspension. On Friday, it permanently banned Trump, and his other close associates.Both also removed Trump’s video where he showed support for rioters, telling them to go home but also “we love you, you’re very special.”TikTok, though obviously not used by Trump, took down re-shares of Trump’s video, but allowed counter speech against it and some posts by news organizations. And it proactively blocked the hashtags used by rioters. Snapchat locked Trump’s account as well, and Twitch disabled him until the end of his term.Twitch disables Trump’s channel until the end of his term to ‘minimize harm’ during transitionNew social apps and startups with social features will often mimic the general approaches of the large platforms as they craft their own content policies. But human rights organizations argue that what’s being done is not enough.Said activist group Color of Change this week, “Mark Zuckerberg does not deserve applause for taking action at the 11th hour, after years of damage has already been done. Facebook is unquestionably complicit in the violent insurrection on Capitol Hill yesterday, and in the erosion of our democracy that’s continued to unfold in plain sight.”Color of Change, activist groups step up pressure to kick Trump off Twitter, FacebookThe group is urging for Trump’s permanent ban from Facebook and for the network to “take action against his enablers and allies who continue to use the platform to incite violence and spread dangerous misinformation.”App Stores take action on ParlerOn Friday, Buzzfeed News reported Parler had received a letter from Apple that said they had 24 hours to come up with a moderation plan for the app, otherwise it would be banned from the App Store. Google Play, however, more quickly banned the app on Friday until the company could commit to a moderation and enforcement policy to handle objectionable content on its network.Google’s statement reads as follows:“In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US.

In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.“Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly loomsParler had been one of the places where Trump supporters and other extremists to organized their plans to storm the Capitol this week as well as plan future attacks. Posts on Parler, which has a looser moderation policy compared with Twitter, often call for people’s deaths and even for Civil War.Several high-profile conservatives, including members of Trump’s family, had been participating on Parler, following the increased enforcement of various polices against election misinformation and false claims about COVID-19, among other things, on mainstream social platforms.It is not unusual for Apple and Google to take action against apps with harmful content, though one has to wonder why it took a deadly insurrection aimed at toppling U.S. democratic processes for them to care.U.S. bans transactions with Chinese payments appsAhead of the violence at the Capitol this week, the Trump administration continued its crackdown on Chinese mobile applications. Via an executive order signed on Tuesday, the U.S. banned transactions with eight Chinese mobile apps, including Ant Group’s Alipay mobile payment app, Reuters first reported.Others named in the order include CamScanner, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate (published by Alibaba Group subsidiary UCWeb) and Beijing Kingsoft Office Software’s WPS Office.The move is meant to cut off China’s access to U.S. user data, including, per the order, the ability for China to “track the locations of federal employees and contractors” and “build dossiers of personal information.”The administration had previously banned TikTok and WeChat, but U.S. courts blocked the orders from going into effect.FTC settles with Tapjoy over deceptive practices, but lays blame at feet of app store gatekeepersImage Credits: TapjoyMobile advertising company Tapjoy settled with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over allegations that it was misleading consumers about the in-app rewards they could earn in mobile games. The FTC said Tapjoy deceived consumers who participated in various activities — like purchasing a product, signing up for a free trial, providing their personal information like an email address or completing a survey — in exchange for in-game virtual currency. But when it was time to pay up, Tapjoy’s partners didn’t deliver.The order will now require Tapjoy to follow up on complaints and monitor to ensure that offers are delivered, or face further fines of up to $43,280 per each violation.Tapjoy serves as a middleman between developers, consumers and advertisers, and is one of many “offerwall”-based mobile ad networks available today.Mobile game developers integrate Tapjoy’s technology to display ads — aka “offers” — to their customers, in order to earn payments for their users’ activity. When the consumer completes the offer by taking whatever action was required, they’re supposed to earn in-game coins or other virtual currency. The app developers then earn a percentage of that ad revenue. But the FTC said that would often not happen, and Tapjoy ignored hundreds of thousands of consumer complaints.Though Tapjoy was the business being held accountable in the FTC’s ruling, the Commissioners harshly scolded the “rent-seeking” app store business model for allowing networks like Tapjoy to rise in the first place. Using language that strongly hinted that regulation of the app stores was on the way, the Commissioners scolded the app stores’ “vast power to impose taxes and regulations on the mobile gaming industry.”“This market structure also has cascading effects on gamers and consumers,” the ruling stated. “Under heavy taxation by Apple and Google, developers have been forced to adopt alternative monetization models that rely on surveillance, manipulation, and other harmful practices,” it said.Apple is being given a lot of credit in recent weeks for its privacy push, with\xa0the launch of its so-called app store “nutrition labels” that help to better highlight the bad actors in the mobile app market. But some of the recent reporting neglects to explain why these alternative business models rose in the first place or detail how Apple will financially benefit from the shift to subscriptions that will result from the mobile ad clampdown. It’s also rarely noted that Apple itself serves behavioral advertising within its own apps that is based on the user data it collects from across its catalog of first-party apps and services. That’s not to say that Apple isn’t doing a service with its privacy push, but it’s a complex matter. This isn’t sports; you don’t have to pick one side or the other.The FTC then not-too-subtly warned Apple and Google that it “will need to use all of its tools — competition, consumer protection, and data protection — to combat middlemen mischief, including by the largest gaming gatekeepers.”Weekly NewsPlatforms: Apple & GoogleGoogle says it will add privacy labels to its app either this week or the next, following a report that claimed it hadn’t updated its app since Apple’s new labeling requirements.iOS 14.4 beta indicates guided audio walking workouts are on the way to Apple Watch.Google to add App Store privacy labels to its iOS apps as soon as this weekServicesQuibi returns.

https://t.co/YKJ1cMMlDt,2021-01-09T16:46:17,The deplatforming of President Trump,"['After years of placid admonishments, the tech world came out in force against President Trump this past week following the violent assault of the U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C. on Wednesday. From Twitter to PayPal, more than a dozen companies have placed unprecedented restrictions or outright banned the current occupant of the White House from using their services, and in some cases, some of his associates and supporters as well.The news was voluminous and continuous for the past few days, so here’s a recap of who took action when, and what might happen next.Twitter: a permanent ban and a real-time attempt to shut down all possible account alternativesTwitter has played a paramount role over the debate about how to moderate President Trump’s communications, given the president’s penchant for the platform and the nearly 90 million followers on his @realDonaldTrump account. In the past, Twitter has repeatedly warned the president, added labels related to election integrity and misinformation, and outright blocked the occasional tweet.This week, however, Twitter’s patience seemed to have been exhausted. Shortly after the riots at the Capitol on Wednesday, Twitter put in place a large banner warning its users about the president’s related tweet on the matter, blocking retweets of that specific message. A few hours later, the company instituted a 12-hour ban on the president’s personal account.At first, it looked like the situation would return to normal, with Twitter offering Thursday morning that it would reinstate the president’s account after he removed tweets the company considered against its policies around inciting violence. The president posted a tweet later on Thursday with a video attachment that seemed to be relatively calmer than his recent fiery rhetoric, a video in which he also accepted the country’s election results for the first time.Enormous pressure externally on its own platform as well as internal demands from employees kept the policy rapidly changing though. Late Friday night, the company announced that it decided to permanently ban the president from its platform, shutting down @realDonaldTrump. The company then played a game of whack-a-mole as it blocked the president’s access to affiliated Twitter handles like @TeamTrump (his official campaign account) as well as the official presidential account @POTUS and deleted individual tweets from the president. The company’s policies state that a blocked user may not attempt to use a different account to evade its ban.Twitter has also taken other actions against some of the president’s affiliates and broader audience, blocking Michael Flynn, a bunch of other Trump supporters, and a variety of QAnon figures.With a new president on the horizon, the official @POTUS account will be handed to the new Biden administration, although Twitter has reportedly been intending to reset the account’s followers to zero, unlike its transition of the account in 2016 from Obama to Trump.As for Trump himself, a permanent ban from his most prominent platform begs the question: where will he take his braggadocio and invective next? So far, we haven’t seen the president move his activities to any social network alternatives, but after the past few years (and on Twitter, the last decade), it seems hard to believe the president will merely return to his golf course and quietly ride out to the horizon.Twitter permanently bans President TrumpSnap: a quick lock after dampening the president’s audience for monthsSnap locked the president’s account late Wednesday following the events on Capitol Hill, and seemed to be one of the most poised tech companies to rapidly react to the events taking place in DC. Snap’s lock prevents the president from posting new snaps to his followers on the platform, which currently number approximately two million. As far as TechCrunch knows, that lock remains in place, although the president’s official profile is still available to users.Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the concomitant Black Lives Matter protests, the company had announced back in June that it would remove the president’s account from its curated “Discover” tab, limiting its distribution and discoverability.The president has never really effectively used the Snap platform, and with an indefinite ban in place, it looks unlikely he will find a home there in the future.Snapchat locks President Donald Trump’s accountFacebook / Instagram: A short-to-medium ban with open questions on how long “indefinite” meansFacebook, like Twitter, is one of the president’s most popular destinations for his supporters, and the platform is also a locus for many of the political right’s most popular personalities. It’s moderation actions have been heavily scrutinized by the press over the past few years, but the company has mostly avoided taking direct action against the president — until this week.On Wednesday as rioters walked out of the halls of Congress, Facebook pulled down a video from President Trump that it considered was promoting violence. Later Wednesday evening, that policy eventually extended into a 24-hour ban of the president’s account, which currently has 33 million likes, or followers. The company argued that the president had violated its policies multiple times, automatically triggering the one-day suspension. At the same time, Facebook (and Instagram) took action to block a popular trending hashtag related to the Capitol riots.On Thursday morning, Mark Zuckerberg, in a personal post on his own platform, announced an “indefinite” suspension for the president, with a minimum duration of two weeks. That timing would neatly extend the suspension through the inauguration of president-elect Biden, who is to assume the presidency at noon on January 20th.Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for ‘at least the next two weeks’What will happen after the inauguration? Right now, we don’t know. The president’s account is suspended but not deactivated, which means that the president cannot post new material to his page, but that the page remains visible to Facebook users. The company could remove the suspension once the transition of power is complete, or it may continue the ban longer-term. Given the president’s prominence on the platform and the heavy popularity of the social network among his supporters, Facebook is in a much more intense bind between banning content it deems offensive, and retaining users important to its bottom line.Shopify / PayPal: Ecommerce platforms won’t sell Trump official merchandise for the time beingIt’s not just social networks that are blocking the president’s audience — ecommerce giants are also getting into moderating their platforms against the president. On Thursday, Shopify announced that it was removing the storefronts for both the Trump campaign and Trump’s personal brand.That’s an evolution on policy for the company, which years ago said that it would not moderate its platform, but in recent years has removed some controversial stores, such as some right-wing shops in 2018.PayPal meanwhile has been deactivating the accounts of some groups of Trump supporters this week, who were using the money-transfer fintech to coordinate payments to underwrite the rioters’ actions on Capitol Hill. PayPal has been increasingly banning some political accounts, banning a far-right activist in 2019 and also banning a spate of far-right organizations in the wake of violent protests in Charlottesville in 2017. These bans have so far not extended directly to the president himself from what TechCrunch can glean.Given the president’s well-known personal brand and penchant for product tie-ins before becoming president, it’s a major open question about how these two platforms and others in ecommerce will respond to Trump once he leaves office in two weeks. Will the president go back to shilling steaks, water and cologne? And will he need an ecommerce venue to sell his wares online? Much will depend on Trump’s next goals and whether he stays focused on politics, or heads back to his more commercial pursuits.Shopify pulls Donald Trump stores off its platformGoogle removes Parler from the Google Play Store, while Apple mulls a removal as wellFor supporters of Trump and others concerned about the moderation actions of Facebook and other platforms, Parler has taken the lead as an alternative social network for this audience. Right now, the app is number one in the App Store in the United States, ahead of encrypted and secure messaging app Signal, which is at number four and got a massive endorsement from Elon Musk this week.Parler’s opportunism for growth around the riots on Capitol Hill though has run into a very real barrier: the two tech companies which run the two stores for mobile applications in the United States.Google announced Friday evening that it would be removing the Parler app from its store, citing the social network’s lack of moderation and content filtering capabilities. The app’s page remains down as this article was going to press. That ban means that new users won’t be able to install the app from the Play Store, however, existing users who already have Parler installed will be able to continue using it.Meanwhile, Buzzfeed reports that Apple has reportedly sent a 24-hour takedown notice to Parler’s developers, saying that it would mirror Google’s actions if the app didn’t immediately filter content that endangers safety. As of now, Parler remains available in the App Store, but if the timing is to be believed, the app could be taken down later this Saturday.Given the complexities of content moderation, including the need to hire content moderators en masse, it seems highly unlikely that Parler could respond to these requests in any short period of time. What happens to the app and the president’s supporters long-term next is, right now, anyone’s guess.Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly loomsDiscord / Twitch / YouTube / Reddit / TikTok: All the socials don’t want to be social anymore with President TrumpFinally, let’s head over to the rest of the social networking world, where Trump is just as unpopular as he is at Facebook and Twitter HQ these days. Companies widely blocked the president from accessing their sites, and they also took action against affiliated groups.Google-owned YouTube announced Thursday that it would start handing out “strikes” against channels — including President Trump’s — that post election misinformation. In the past, videos with election misinformation would have a warning label attached, but the channel itself didn’t face any consequences. In December, the company changed that policy to include the outright removal of videos purveying election misinformation.Twitch disables Trump’s channel until the end of his term to ‘minimize harm’ during transitionThis week’s latest policy change is an escalation from the company’s previous approach, and would result in lengthier and lengthier temporary suspensions for each additional strike that a channel receives. Those strikes could eventual result in a permanent ban for a YouTube channel if they happen within a set period of time. That’s precisely what happened with Steve Bannon’s channel, which was permanently banned Friday late afternoon for repeated violations of YouTube’s policies. Meanwhile, President Trump’s official channel has less than 3 million followers, and is currently still available for viewing on the platform.Outside YouTube, Twitch followed a similar policy to Facebook, announcing Thursday morning that it would ban the president “indefinitely” and at least through the inauguration on January 20th. The president has a limited audience of just about 151,000 followers on the popular streaming platform, making it among the least important of the president’s social media accounts.Reddit ‘taking action’ on site violations as rioters storm US CapitolIn terms of the president’s supporters, their groups are also being removed from popular tech platforms. On Friday, Reddit announced that it would ban the subreddit r/DonaldTrump, which had become one of a number of unofficial communities on the platform where the president’s most ardent supporters hung out. The social network had previously removed the controversial subreddit r/The_Donald back in June. Discord on Friday shut down a server related to that banned subreddit, citing the server’s “overt connection to an online forum used to incite violence.”Lastly, TikTok announced on Thursday that it was limiting the spread of some information related to the Capitol riots, including redirecting hashtags and removing violent content as well as the president’s own video message to supporters. The president does not have a TikTok account, and therefore, most of the company’s actions are focused on his supporters and broader content surrounding the situation on Capitol Hill this week.TikTok bans videos of Trump inciting mob, blocks #stormthecapital and other hashtags\xa0']",Twitter permanently bans President Trump,"['Trump', 'NavigationClose ScreenFeatured ArticleThe', 'Jose A.

https://t.co/wdbxV9ak2k,2021-01-08T17:49:03,Jumbotail raises $14.2 million for its wholesale marketplace in India,"['Jumbotail, an online wholesale marketplace for grocery and food items, said on Friday it has raised an additional $14.2 million as the Bangalore-based startup chases the opportunity to digitize neighborhood stores in the world’s second-largest internet market.The five-year-old startup said the new tranche of its Series B financing round was led by VII Ventures, with participation from Nutresa, Veronorte, Jumbofund, Klinkert Investment Trust, Peter Crosby Trust, Nexus Venture Partners and Discovery Ventures.The startup told TechCrunch that the new tranche concludes its Series B round, which it kickstarted in 2019 with a tranche of $12.7 million. It ended up raising about $44 million in the Series B round (including Friday’s tranche), and to date has amassed about $54 million in equity investment, the startup told the publication.Jumbotail said it serves more than 30,000 neighborhood stores (popularly known in India as kiranas) in the country. In addition to its business-to-business marketplace, the startup also provides working capital to neighborhood stores through partnerships with financial institutions.Indian B2B e-commerce startup Udaan raises $280 millionThe startup, which has built its own supply chain network to enable last-mile delivery, also supplies these stores with point-of-sale devices so they can easily get access to a much wider selection of catalog and have the new inventory shipped to them within two days. It also integrates these stores with hyperlocal delivery startups such as Dunzo and Swiggy to help mom and pop shops further expand their customer base.Ashish Jhina, co-founder of Jumbotail, said he believes the startup has reached an inflection point in its growth and is now ready for its next chapter, which includes hiring top talent and expanding to more regions in the country, especially in several cities in South India.“We are seeing tremendous interest from investors across the globe who are drawn to our highly scalable and operationally profitable business model, built on the industry’s best technology and customer NPS,” said Jhina.At a recent virtual conference, Jhina said that the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to order a nationwide lockdown and\xa0put restrictions on e-commerce firms, has illustrated just how crucial neighborhood stores are in people’s lives. And for all the ills that the virus has wrought, it did help accelerate the adoption of technology among these stores.A number of food brands whose products neighborhood stores sell today are not standardized, which poses a question about their quality. To fill this gap, Jumbotail runs its own private label portfolio and Jhina said the startup will deploy part of the fresh fund to broaden this catalog. Having a private label also allows Jumbotail to ensure that its retail partners can get the supply of items throughout the year — and of course, it also helps the startup, which has been operationally profitable for nearly three quarters, improve its margin.There are more than 30 million neighborhood stores in India located across the thousands of cities and towns in the country. These small businesses have been around for decades and survived — and even thrived — despite e-commerce giants pouring billions of dollars in India to change how people shop. In recent years, scores of startups — and giants — in India have begun to explore ways to work with these neighborhood stores.One of them is India’s largest retail chain Reliance Retail, which serves more than 3.5 million customers each week through its nearly 10,000 physical stores in more than 6,500 cities and towns in the country. In late 2019, it entered the e-commerce space with JioMart through a joint venture with sister subsidiary telecom giant Jio Platforms. By mid last year, JioMart had expanded to over 200 Indian cities and towns\xa0— though currently its reach within those cities and customer service leave a lot to be desired.Reliance Retail also maintains a\xa0partnership with Facebook for WhatsApp integration. Facebook, which invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms last year, has said that it will explore various ways to work with Reliance to digitize the nation’s mom and pop stores, as well as other small and medium-sized businesses.For JioMart, Reliance Retail is working with neighborhood shops, giving them a digital point-of-sale machine to make it easier for them to accept money electronically. It is also allowing these shops to buy their inventory from Reliance Retail, and then use their physical presence as delivery points. At present, the platform is largely focused on grocery delivery. In a recent report to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that Reliance could become the largest player in online grocery within three years.Facebook invests $5.7B in India’s Reliance Jio Platforms']",citing concerns,"['Jumbotail', 'NavigationClose ScreenJumbotail', 'JumbotailJumbotail', 'VII Ventures', 'Klinkert Investment Trust', 'Peter Crosby Trust', 'Nexus Venture Partners', 'Discovery Ventures', 'Jumbotail', 'Udaan', 'Swiggy', 'Jumbotail', 'NPS', 'Jumbotail', 'Jumbotail', 'Reliance Retail', 'JioMart', 'Jio Platforms', 'JioMart', 'Reliance Retail', 'WhatsApp', 'Jio Platforms', 'Reliance', 'JioMart', 'Reliance Retail', 'Reliance Retail', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Reliance', 'Reliance Jio PlatformsclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'PlatformsJumbotailNexus Venture PartnersReliance', 'IndiaManish Singh6:49 PM', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Cg1GieGs3Q,2021-01-09T02:37:02,Why Twitter says it banned President Trump,"['Twitter permanently banned the U.S. president Friday, taking a dramatic step to limit Trump’s ability to communicate with his followers. That decision, made in light of his encouragement for Wednesday’s violent invasion of the U.S. Capitol, might seem sudden for anyone not particularly familiar with his Twitter presence.In reality, Twitter gave Trump many, many second chances over his four years as president, keeping him on the platform due to the company’s belief that speech by world leaders is in the public interest, even if it breaks the rules.Twitter permanently bans President TrumpNow that Trump’s gone for good, we have a pretty interesting glimpse into the policy decision making that led Twitter to bring the hammer down on Friday. The company first announced Trump’s ban in a series of tweets from its @TwitterSafety account but also linked to a blog post detailing its thinking.In that deep dive, the company explains that it gave Trump one last chance after suspending and then reinstating his account for violations made on Wednesday. But the following day, a pair of tweets the president made pushed him over the line. Twitter said those tweets, pictured below, were not examined on a standalone basis, but rather in the context of his recent behavior and this week’s events.“… We have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service,” Twitter wrote.Screenshot via TwitterThis is how the company explained its reasoning, point by point:“President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an ‘orderly transition’ on January 20th.“The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a ‘safe’ target, as he will not be attending.“The use of the words ‘American Patriots’ to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.“The mention of his supporters having a ‘GIANT VOICE long into the future’ and that ‘They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!’ is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an ‘orderly transition’ and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election.“Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021.”All of that is pretty intuitive, though his most fervent supporters aren’t likely to agree. Ultimately these decisions, as much as they do come down to stated policies, involve a lot of subjective analysis and interpretation. Try as social media companies might to let algorithms make the hard calls for them, the buck stops with a group of humans trying to figure out the best course of action.Twitter’s explanation here offers a a rare totally transparent glimpse into how social networks decide what stays and what goes. It’s a big move for Twitter — one that many people reasonably believe should have been made months if not years ago — and it’s useful to have what is so often an inscrutable high-level decision making process laid out plainly and publicly for all to see.President Trump responds to Twitter account ban in tweet storm from @POTUS account']",Envisics nabs $50M for its in-car holographic display tech at a $250M+ valuation,"['Twitter', 'Trump', 'NavigationClose', 'Bryce Durbin', 'Trump’s', 'Twitter', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'Trump’s', '@TwitterSafety', 'Tweets', 'the Glorification of Violence Policy', 'Trump’s', 'Inauguration', 'Tweets', 'Dan Scavino', 'Inauguration', 'Trump', 'Twitter’s', 'Trump', '@POTUS', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Donald', 'TrumpTaylor Hatmaker3:37', 'Trump’s', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/nACslj6TrO,2021-01-09T01:55:55,President Trump responds to Twitter account ban in tweet storm from @POTUS account,"['After Twitter took the major step Friday of permanently banning President Trump’s @realdonaldtrump Twitter account, the President aimed to get the last word in through his government account @POTUS which has a fraction of the Twitter followers but still offered the President a megaphone on the service to send out a few last tweets.The tweets were deleted within minutes by Twitter which does not allow banned individuals to circumvent a full ban by tweeting under alternate accounts.In screenshots captured by TechCrunch, Trump responds to the account ban by accusing Twitter employees of conspiring with his political opponents. “As I have been saying for a long time, Twitter has gone further and further in banning free speech, and tonight, Twitter employees have coordinated with the Democrats and Radical Left in removing my account from their platform, to silence me — and YOU, the 75,000,000 great patriots who voted for me.”The President’s rant further contends that he will soon be joining a new platform or starting his own. Many contended Trump would join right wing social media site Parler following the ban, though Friday afternoon the site was removed from the Google Play Store with the company saying Apple had threatened to suspend them as well.“We have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future,” other tweets from the @POTUS account read in part.The same messages were later tweeted from the President’s @Teamtrump campaign account, which Twitter subsequently suspended.In a statement to TechCrunch, A Twitter spokesperson wrote, “As we’ve said, using another account to try to evade a suspension is against our rules. We have taken steps to enforce this with regard to recent Tweets from the @POTUS account.

All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.“Parler’s Play Store page is currently down.The conservative platform garnered attention this week after posts surfaced detailing threats of violence and planning around Tuesday’s chaotic Capitol building riots which led to the deaths of 5 people including a Capitol police officer. While more mainstream social media sites raced to take down violent content related to the riots, death threats and violence were easy to find across the Parler platform.The app hosts accounts from a variety of conservative figures including many in the President’s family, though not the President himself.Twitter permanently bans President TrumpOn Friday, Buzzfeed News reported that Parler had received a letter from Apple informing them that the app would be removed from the App Store within 24 hours unless the company submitted an update with a moderation improvement plan.

https://t.co/eBaL81W9f5,2021-01-08T23:26:54,Twitter permanently bans President Trump,"['Twitter permanently removed the president of the United States from its platform Friday, citing concerns over the “risk of further incitement of violence” and Trump’s previous transgressions.“In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action,” Twitter wrote. “… We made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence.”Trump will not be able to get around Twitter’s ban by making a new account or using an alias, a Twitter spokesperson clarified to TechCrunch. If the president attempts to evade his suspension, any account he uses will also be subject to a ban for breaking Twitter’s rules.Update: Trump appeared to do just that Friday night, popping up on @POTUS. “We will not be SILENCED! Twitter is not about FREE SPEECH,” Trump tweeted through that account, indicating that his team might build his own platform in the “near future.”Twitter emphasized that it made the threat of an impending ban clear and called this week’s events “horrific.” While Trump has previously broken the platform’s rules, the company’s maintained his account under its special guidance for world leaders and information in the public interest.In an in-depth breakdown, Twitter published the assessments of Trump’s tweets that led to his suspension. Two of his tweets on Thursday appear to have pushed the account over the edge, and Twitter interpreted them as potentially inciting violence in the context of the week’s events.Why Twitter banned President TrumpOn Wednesday, Twitter suspended President Trump’s account until he deleted three tweets that the company flagged as violating its rules. Trump’s account was set to reactivate 12 hours after those deletions, and he returned to the platform on Thursday night with a video in which he appeared to concede his election loss for the first time.Trump crossed a line with Twitter when he failed to condemn a group of his supporters who staged a violent riot at the Capitol building while Congress met to certify the election results. In one tweet, Trump shared a video in which he gently encouraged the group to return home, while reassuring his agitated followers that he loved them and that they were “special.”At that time, Twitter said that Trump’s tweets contained “repeated and severe violations” of its policy on civic integrity and threatened that any future violations would result in “permanent suspension” of the president’s account.After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.https://t.co/CBpE1I6j8Y— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) January 8, 2021Wednesday, January 6:1 PM ET: Trump wraps up a rally near the White House protesting the legitimate election results. During the event he urges attendees to march toward Congress.2:15 PM: Trump supporters breach the interior of the Capitol building.4:15 PM: Trump tweets a video gently telling rioters that they need to go home and “we love you.”5 PM: Twitter places a large warning label on the video.6 PM: Trump tweets again, failing to denounce the violence and urging his supporters to “Remember this day forever!”7 PM: Twitter locks Trump out his account until he deletes three tweets and waits for a 12-hour period.As a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C., we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump Tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy. https://t.co/k6OkjNG3bM— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) January 7, 2021Thursday, January 7:Trump’s account reinstated. In a video shared to Twitter, the president for the first time personally denounces the “heinous attack” and makes what sounds like a concession speech.Friday, January 8:9:45 AM: Trump tweets again with a less conciliatory tone, declaring that anyone who voted for him will “not be treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”10:45 AM: Trump tweets that he will not attend President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.6:20 PM: Twitter announces that @realDonaldTrump is suspended permanently.While Facebook initially took more drastic action against Trump’s account in the aftermath of Wednesday’s chaotic siege on Capitol Hill, Twitter has a longer history of friction with the outgoing president. In early 2020, Twitter’s decision to add a contextual label to a Trump tweet calling mail-in voting “fraudulent” prompted the president to craft a retaliatory though largely toothless executive order targeting social media companies.Trump held the same grudge through the end of the year, trying to push a doomed repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — the law that protects online companies from liability for user-generated content — through Congress in increasingly unusual ways.Twitter’s move Friday to suspend the sitting U.S. president from its platform is a historic decision — and one the company avoided making for the last four years. In the wake of Wednesday’s insurrectionist violence, and Trump’s role in inciting it, tech’s biggest social networks appear to have at last had enough.But as with election conspiracies, dangerous COVID-19 misinformation and the camo-clad extremists who attacked the Capitol this week, it’s too late to undo the chaos that real-time Trump unleashed over the last four years, 280 characters at a time.President Trump responds to Twitter account ban in tweet storm from @POTUS account']",AI-generated hybrid treats.,"['Trump', 'NavigationClose', 'Trump’s', 'the Twitter Rules', 'Twitter’s', '@POTUS', 'Trump', 'Twitter', 'Trump’s', 'TrumpOn Wednesday', 'Trump’s', 'Trump’s', 'Trump', 'Congress', 'Trump', 'Twitter', 'Trump’s', 'Tweets', 'Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety', 'White House', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'Joe Biden’s', 'Trump’s', 'Capitol Hill', 'Twitter', 'Twitter’s', 'Trump', 'Congress', 'Twitter’s', 'Trump’s', 'Capitol', 'Trump', '@POTUS', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'TrumpTaylor', 'Trump’s', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/kbV1fOrNHc,2021-01-08T23:14:41,Holographic startup Envisics partners with Panasonic to fast-track in-car AR tech,"['Envisics founder and CEO Dr. Jamieson Christmas launched the startup three years ago to “revolutionize” the in-car experience with its holographic technology. Now, it has a partner that could help it achieve that mission.The U.K.-based holographic technology startup said Friday it reached an agreement with Panasonic Automotive Systems to jointly develop and commercialize a new generation of head-up displays for cars, trucks and SUVs. Panasonic Automotive Systems is a Tier 1 automotive supplier and a division of Panasonic Corporation of North America. The head-up displays are units integrated in the dash of a vehicle that project images onto the windshield to aid drivers with navigation and provide other alerts. The Panasonic HUDs, as they’re often called, will use Envisics holographic technology.The deal, announced ahead of the virtual 2021 CES tech trade show, follows Envisics’ $50 million Series B funding round and news that its tech will be integrated in the upcoming Cadillac Lyriq electric vehicle. The funding round, which brought Envisics a valuation of more than $250 million, included investments from Hyundai Mobis, GM Ventures, SAIC Ventures and Van Tuyl Companies.Envisics’ technology, the foundation of which came out of Christmas’ PhD studies at Cambridge University more than 15 years ago, electronically manipulates the speed of light. This process enables images to appear three-dimensional, Christmas explained in a recent interview. The company has secured more than 250 patents and has another 160 pending certification.The company is solely focused upon the automotive application of holography, Christmas said, adding that its first generation is already integrated in more than 150,000 Jaguar Land Rover vehicles.Christmas said this new agreement aims to combine Panasonic’s expertise in optical design and its global reach as a Tier 1 supplier with Envisics’ technology to bring holography into the mainstream. Mass production of vehicles using its technology is slated for 2023, according to the companies.“This is very much about part of our business plan, you know the Series B funding round we undertook was about scaling the business and enabling us to move forward as we enter the market,” Christmas said. “Part of that was a commitment to engage in partnerships with Tier ones that we can then work with to deliver these products to market.“This is the first of those agreements,” he added, suggesting that Envisics has a much larger aim.What that means, Christmas said, will be head-up displays with high resolution, wide color gamut and large images that can be overlaid upon reality. The technology can also project information at multiple distances simultaneously.“That really unlocks very interesting applications,” he said. “In the short term, it will be kind of relatively simple augmented reality applications like navigation, highlighting the lane you’re supposed to be in and some safety applications. But as you look forward into things like autonomous driving it unlocks a whole realm of other opportunities like entertainment and video conferencing.”He added that it could even be used for night vision applications such as overlaying enhanced information upon a dark road to make it clear where the road is going and what obstacles might be out there.Envisics nabs $50M for its in-car holographic display tech at a $250M+ valuation']",both suspended,"['Panasonic', 'NavigationClose ScreenHolographic', 'Panasonic', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'Jamieson', 'Panasonic Automotive Systems', 'Panasonic Automotive Systems', 'Panasonic Corporation of North America', 'Panasonic', 'Cadillac', 'Hyundai Mobis', 'GM Ventures', 'SAIC Ventures', 'Cambridge University', 'Jaguar', 'Panasonic’s', 'Envisics', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'SystemsHolographic', 'Panasonic', 'Jamieson', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/1znjyeoQ9d,2021-01-08T22:17:24,You’ll never believe what this email thread says about the ad-funded ‘open’ web,"['Among a number of claims on U.K. adtech lobby group MOW’s website is the canonical biggie that “Advertising funds the open web.”This coalition of “marketers,” whose members are not being made public despite its sweeping claims to love web openness — lest, MOW says, Google rain down punishment upon its ranks of “top companies from across the globe” — recently complained to the U.K.’s competition regulator about the tech giant’s plan to end support for tracking cookies.If you didn’t already guess it the “OW” in MOW’s acronym stands for “Open Web.” Aka (unknown) Marketers for an Open Web.And today the CMA duly announced it is investigating Mountain View’s “Privacy Sandbox.” Though, as yet, no conclusions have been reached on whether Google’s plan threatens competition.Google’s plan to replace tracking cookies goes under UK antitrust probeIn truth, a variety of business models support open access to information on the internet.Wikipedia, for example — surely the canonical example of the open web — relies upon reader donations to keep the lights on as a not-for-profit.While — on the “exclusive access” side — crowdfunding sites like Patreon and the subscription platform Substack offer tools for creators to solicit regular monetary subscriptions from fans and backers to unlock gated content.But it’s instructive to note how many online publishers have shifted, year over year, from free (ad-supported) access to content to selling subscriptions for (paywalled) content, often in addition to running ads.Whether it’s the Financial Times, the New York Times, the Telegraph or Business Insider, the list of pay-to-access news sites keeps getting longer. Much like the consent flows that (also) pop up asking to process visitors’ information in order to target them with ads.TechCrunch joined the ranks of subscription publications almost two years ago when we launched Extra Crunch. The main TC site continues to be free to access supported by ads and our events business. (NB: In 2021 our events are going fully virtual — which means, as a brief, bonus aside, they’ve never been so open and accessible!)So how come all these paywalls are being thrown up if advertising funds the open web, as MOW claims?The concise answer is that digital advertising pays publishers so poorly it can’t support producing quality content at the required scale on its own — thanks to myriad adtech intermediaries, click fraud and the big two: Google and Facebook; aka, the adtech duopoly, who take the lion’s share of revenue generated by digital advertising.\xa0“We have found that intermediaries (the largest of which is Google) capture at least 35% of the value of advertising bought from newspapers and other content providers in the U.K.,” the CMA reported last summer, in a major market study.Consumers turning to ad blockers to escape creepy ads and prevent privacy-hostile trackers from keeping real-time tabs on their digital activity and systematically passing this intel to scores of unknowns in an ad auction process that the U.K.’s own data protection regulator has said isn’t very lawful, is another relevant factor here.Online advertising certainly funds something. But is that something the open web? That looks rather debatable at this point.Don’t miss this epic Twitter fight between the IAB’s CEO and actual publishersI bring all this up merely to provide context for a chance detail in the MOW story that I want to share — as it illustrates some of the issues in this high stakes tug-of-war between publishers, digital marketing and adtech players and a handful of big (ad)tech versus the poor, frustrated eyeballs of the average internet user.It’s an important power struggle.One which threatens to keep steamrollering internet users’ right to protect their personal information from exploitation (and wider security-related risks) by, in the latest twist, co-opting competition regulators to erect barriers to pro-privacy reform. Assuming, that is, the CMA ends up naively swallowing dubious claims about what advertising does for the “open” internet — when evidence of what it actually does is but a click and a paywall/tortuously long consent to “share” your private data with hundreds of unknown firms away.The regulator’s announcement today suggests it’s alive to the dysfunction surrounding internet users’ privacy and will take more than a superficial look at that issue — though if the ICO is the main rep in the room batting for users’ interests here that’s suboptimal, to say the least, given the latter’s storied reluctance to enforce the actual law against adtech.But here’s the tidbit — which comes by way of a PR agency working for MOW. Earlier today it CC’d me into an email thread in which several staffers had been discussing monitoring the CMA news on behalf of its client. I’m not naming the agency or any of the individuals involved to spare their blushes but in the thread — which begins with “FYI — The CMA are just about to announce a formal investigation into Google. We’ve drafted a comment which we will be circulating shortly” — staff can be seen asking to share logins to a number of newspaper websites and/or start a free trial in order to access newspaper copy for free, i.e., without having to pay for new subscriptions.\xa0“Do we have an FT login? If so, could you get hte [sic] story they’ve just written on MOW off for me?” asks one staffer.Shortly afterward there’s a discussion about starting a free trial on the Telegraph’s website as they talk about collating relevant coverage into a single document to be able to monitor developments for MOW.One staffer chips in to warn “you need to put credit card details in to start a trial” — before suggesting the other has a go “to see if you find a way around it.”This person follows up by saying they’ll “let you know if I manage to find a way around it.”So, mmm, irony much?Redacted screengrab showing part of an email thread in which MOW’s PR agency discusses how to access newspaper sites to access copy to collate coverage on behalf of their client. Image Credits: TechCrunch.In light of MOW’s advocacy for a “vibrant” ad-supported open web — which its website implies is aligned with the interests of publishers, marketers and adtech providers alike, i.e., not just with opaque adtech interests — it seems pretty relevant that an agency working for the industry group is uninterested, to put it politely, in paying for relevant newspaper content while being paid to lobby on adtech’s behalf.On its website MOW argues that letting Google switch off third-party tracking cookies will be bad news for publishers because it says it will cut off marketers’ ability to measure ad campaign performance across different sites — claiming that will result in less effective ads that yield a lower return and thus less cash remitted by marketers to publishers.Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two yearsHowever the CMA’s recent deep dive study of the digital marketing sector found an industry so opaque and riddled with black box algorithms that the regulator listed “lack of transparency” itself as a competition concern.“Platforms with market power have the incentive and ability to increase prices, for example, or to overstate the quality and effectiveness of their advertising inventory,” it warned in the report. “They can take steps to reduce the degree of transparency in digital advertising markets, reducing other publishers’ ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of their advertising and forcing advertisers to rely on information and metrics provided by those platforms. And the lack of transparency undermines the ability of market participants to make the informed decisions necessary to drive competition. The upshot of all of these issues is that competition is weakened and trust in the market is eroded.”Given that overarching assessment, who would take an opaque coalition of marketers’ word for it that current-gen cookie tracking of the entire internet yields irreplaceably valuable performance metrics?Or that such privacy-hostile tracking is the only viable way to support a “vibrant open web”?“The lack of transparency is particularly severe in the open display market where publishers and advertisers rely on intermediaries to manage the process of real-time bidding and ad serving but cannot observe directly what the intermediaries are doing or, in some cases, how much they are being charged,” the CMA goes on, sharpening its concerns about the extent of the obfuscation that cloaks the practices of adtech middlemen. “Market participants such as newspapers and advertisers typically do not have visibility of the fees charged along the entire supply chain and this limits their ability to make optimal choices on how to buy or to sell inventory, reducing competition among intermediaries.”One thing is clear: The adtech industry needs a whole lot of disinfecting sunlight to be shone in. And that clarification process will surely demand substantial reform.Refusing to change how things are done by claiming there’s simply no other way to preserve the web “as we know it” is as ridiculous an idea as it is anti-innovation in sentiment.Returning to the misfired email thread, we contacted MOW’s PR agency to ask whether or not the account includes expenses for relevant newspaper subscriptions. It told us these would come out of a central agency fund. Additionally — having checked back on it — the agency said it did in fact have subscriptions to the newspaper sites in question.The spokesperson explained that the staffers involved just hadn’t realized at the time — in the heat of the “day-to-day PR” moment (and whilst wrangling remote-working-impacted comms). And, presumably, as all those subscription login screens threw up barriers to accessing the content they needed in the heat of the moment.This (senior) spokesperson blamed themselves for what they described as a “cock up” — including the soliciting of a “paywall workaround” — going on to take full mea culpa responsibility and emphasizing it had nothing to do with MOW or with the MOW account.But, well, if an agency working for an adtech lobby group whose key claim is that “ads support the open internet” is unable to access the online content they need to do their job without a subscription, what does that tell us about how much of an open internet the advertising industry is actually funding\xa0right now?Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news']",as we explained yesterday,"['NavigationClose', 'SuperStock / Getty', 'MOW’s', 'MOW', 'MOW’s', 'Aka', 'CMA', 'Mountain View’s', 'Google’s', 'Wikipedia', 'Patreon', 'Substack', 'the Financial Times', 'the New York Times', 'Telegraph', 'Business Insider', 'TC', 'NB', 'MOW', 'IAB', 'MOW', 'CMA', 'ICO', 'MOW', 'CMA', 'MOW', 'the Telegraph’s', 'MOW’s', 'MOW’s', 'MOW', 'Google', 'MOW’s', 'MOW', 'MOW', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'MOW’s', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/jW4QZG1KbX,2021-01-08T21:57:16,Twitter bans former Trump adviser Michael Flynn and other QAnon figures,"['Twitter took action against a pair of President Trump’s close associates Friday, banning them from the platform as part of a broader effort to contain the QAnon conspiracy movement.Trump’s first national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell were both suspended under Twitter’s “coordinated harmful activity” policy. Ron Watkins, who previously ran 8kun (formerly 8chan) also saw his account removed.“We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm, and given the renewed potential for violence surrounding this type of behavior in the coming days, we will permanently suspend accounts that are solely dedicated to sharing QAnon content,” a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch.In recent months, each figure has promoted QAnon, an elaborate constellation of conspiracy theories purporting that\xa0President Trump is waging a secret battle against a cabal of political enemies who engage in child sex trafficking, among other baseless claims.As part of Trump’s post-election legal team, Powell became a heroic figure to the QAnon crowd, which believes that a master plan being orchestrated behind the scenes will give the president a second term. Powell also amplified the Dominion voting machine conspiracy, which claims devices from that company switched votes from Trump to Biden. Dominion Voting Systems is suing Powell for $1.3 billion over the false claims, arguing that her “viral disinformation campaign” has damaged its business.Flynn embraced the QAnon movement last year, reciting an oath and saying the popular QAnon motto “where we go one, we go all!” Flynn has also been actively involved in Trump’s quest to overturn the results of the November election. In what was then a shocking scandal, Flynn pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI in 2017. Last year, the Justice Department dropped the federal case against Flynn and Trump eventually issued his former adviser a pardon.Of the three, Watkins is the furthest from Trump and the closest to the heart of QAnon. As the administrator of QAnon’s central online hub, Watkins played a key role QAnon’s explosion into the mainstream over the last few years. Beyond the ranks of believers, some QAnon observers believe that Ron Watkins or his father Jim Watkins are the mysterious “Q” figure, perpetuating the elaborate scheme by doling out cryptic bread crumbs for QAnon adherents.Twitter first began restricting QAnon content in mid-2020, citing similar concerns over real-world harm. The new enforcement plan goes much further, and Twitter’s new commitment to permanently suspending any QAnon stands to have a much bigger impact.We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm. In line with this approach, this week we are taking further action on so-called ‘QAnon’ activity across the service.— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) July 22, 2020Twitter cracks down on QAnon conspiracy theory, banning 7,000 accounts']",useful commentary underscoring,"['Trump', 'Michael Flynn', 'QAnon', 'NavigationClose', 'Trump', 'Michael Flynn', 'QAnon', 'Hatmaker@tayhatmaker /', 'Trump', 'QAnon', 'Trump’s', 'Michael Flynn', 'Trump', 'Sidney Powell', 'Ron Watkins', 'QAnon', 'QAnon', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'Powell', 'QAnon', 'Powell', 'Dominion', 'Trump to Biden', 'Dominion Voting Systems', 'Powell', 'Flynn', 'QAnon', 'QAnon', 'Flynn', 'Trump’s', 'Flynn', 'FBI', 'the Justice Department', 'Flynn', 'Trump', 'Watkins', 'Trump', 'QAnon', 'QAnon’s', 'Watkins', 'QAnon', 'QAnon', 'Ron Watkins', 'Jim Watkins', 'QAnon', 'QAnon', 'Twitter’s', 'QAnon', 'QAnon', 'Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety', 'QAnon', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Trump', 'Michael Flynn', 'QAnon', 'Trump', 'QAnon', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/a8F0UqYowJ,2021-01-08T20:44:37,"Venrock’s Bryan Roberts on the firm’s new $450 million fund, and where it’s shopping in 2021","['Venrock, the 51-year-old firm that started as the venture arm of the Rockefeller family, has closed its ninth fund with $450 million, the same amount it raised for its last two funds. The outfit, with offices in Palo Alto, New York and Cambridge, clearly feels comfortable with the fund size, but it says change is otherwise a constant, given that trends and tech shift so fast that so-called pattern recognition can prove a liability if an investment team isn’t careful.To learn more about what the team is tracking at Venrock — whose newest exits include last year’s IPOs of Cloudflare and 10x Genomics IPO, and the recent sales of Corvidia and Personal Capital — we were in touch earlier today with longtime partner Bryan Roberts, who has spent his 24-year career in venture with the firm.Our exchange has been edited lightly for length and clarity.TC: I talked with your colleague Camille Samuels earlier this year about aging biology. How big an area of focus is that for Venrock and why?BR: It’s one of many interesting areas of biology on a go-forward basis, along with immunology, CNS (central nervous system) and other areas where there has been little progress and great unmet need.TC: Speaking of unmet needs, Camille also talked about why infectious disease isn’t good business for new companies, as are cancers and orphan diseases. As she explained it, with something like the coronavirus, it’s hard to get funding before it’s an actual problem; once a treatment is developed, it has to be sold at low cost, and then you hope you won’t have repeat customers. Do you agree, and do you think this needs to change?BR: Yes, I think things need to change, but there are several issues. In the case of one company on which I lost a bunch of money — Achaogen, which made a successful drug for a big unmet need [but faced] screwy commercialization dynamics in the infectious disease space — and for many historical infectious disease companies, the cost of a drug is borne by the hospital, not billed separately.Veteran healthcare VC Camille Samuels explains why trying to cure infectious disease is a lousy businessIt has also been hard historically to get anyone to pay attention to much of anything from a preventive perspective — even more so in communicable diseases. COVID was, on the one hand, not a particularly hard biological problem to solve, but from an investing perspective, the issue was it was a problem tailor-made for an existent or large company to tackle, not a startup. Startups take 12 or more months to find their way out the front door, and the problem is largely solved by then by one of the very large competitors.You saw this with Moderna. Its tech turned out to be specifically suited to vaccines — and then a pandemic hit.TC: Venrock recently helped incubate a new microbiome startup called Federation Bio, which is the firm’s first bet on the space. Why not move faster into this area, and how would you describe the size of the opportunity now? Is this something you want to delve into more aggressively?BR: We did spend 12 months or so helping get Federation started, including my partner Racquel Bracken acting as the initial CEO. We weren’t compelled by the prior approaches and teams, and it is really the intersection of those two dynamics that get us involved in new projects.In this case, a terrific academic, Michael Fischbach, had generated great data, so we ran with it. We recently spent more than 12 months incubating a new gene therapy startup in the same manner — in the latter case, a couple of great academics generated exquisite cell type specificity — so we went out and found some leadership and just seeded the business.TC: It’s one way to avoid crazy valuations. Where have valuations gone up the most?BR: Everywhere, but especially for companies that appear — or actually have — reduced binary risk and become growth-stage businesses [and that’s] across sectors.TC: You focus on so much: biotechnology, diagnostics, genomics, healthcare IT, medical devices. What are some of biggest trends you’re watching in some of these areas, and where do you think you might be spending a little more of your time in 2021?BR: Personally, I am compelled these days by first, value-based care in healthcare delivery — meaning it’s more efficient, there are better outcomes, there’s better customer experience — and mostly from full-stack platforms versus point solutions. I’m also focused on biological insights and applications that new genomics tools — single cell; gene editing — can bring. Last, [I’m tracking what] novel therapeutic modalities can bring to really bad diseases. It feels like we’re in the first inning of cell and gene therapy.TC: How do you think the new administration in Washington could impact your work?BR: I think there will be lots of talk about material changes to healthcare and other stuff, but I think it will mostly be talk given the slim margin in the Senate, as well as the decreased and small margin [that Democrats have] in the House. I think it will be a positive in that a bunch of the silly stuff around the [Affordable Care Act] will fade to nothing and people can get on with trying to improve implementation and go build.TC: What do you make of the recent collapse of Haven, the joint venture of Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to reduce the healthcare costs of their own employees? Would you like to see Amazon focused more — or less — on healthcare?BR: We’ve long been bears [about its odds] for a bunch of the reasons folks cited over the last few weeks [including lack of transparency into healthcare costs].The Amazon-Berkshire Hathaway-JPMorgan healthcare joint venture is officially endingI would love to see Amazon use its brand, delivery logistics excellence and ability to compete at super-tight margins in healthcare. I don’t think it extends to real regulatory, privacy or risk appetite, but the company could be an awesome pharmacy/pharmacy benefit manager — and I hope they do it.TC: Regarding Venrock’s new fund, have there been personnel changes? Will check sizes change?\xa0BR: We made Racquel Bracken and Ethan Batraski partners; it’s always fun when you can promote terrific young talent from within.As for our high-level strategy, check sizes and stages all remain the same. We’ve raised $450 million for each of the last several funds because we like that size and our culture and personality is way more focused on performance than on asset accumulation. It also feels really hard to raise increasing amounts of capital without affecting performance excellence.TC: Healthcare has never been hotter. How much of Venrock’s capital is focused on healthcare, and will that change with this newest fund?BR: We’re pretty bottoms-up allocation driven; we invest based on the projects we find and fall in love with. Life sciences usually ends up being around 30% to 40% [of capital invested]. Healthcare IT, which depending who you talk to in the universe gets lumped into healthcare or tech — I confess those software-enabled services businesses feel much more tech-like than biotech — usually ends up being about a quarter of the fund and there are no anticipated changes. The balance will go into tech — primarily tech and data-enabled software and services businesses.TC: Has Venrock considered forming a blank-check company to take a company public, as more VCs are doing?BR: We have not. I feel like most investors that have formed SPACs have done so more because of the compelling sponsor economics than a compelling, durable mechanism to get awesome companies public in a much more efficient manner than they otherwise might. It’ll be interesting to see how the economics change as the supply and demand of SPACs versus “great targets” changes and the SPACs get closer to the end of their hunting-license period.Cloudflare co-founder Michelle Zatlyn on the company’s IPO today, its unique dual class structure, and what’s next']",president of GM,"['Venrock’s', 'Bryan Roberts', 'Bryan Roberts', 'Rockefeller', 'Cloudflare', 'Corvidia and Personal Capital', 'Bryan Roberts', 'Camille Samuels', 'CNS', 'Camille', 'Achaogen', 'VC Camille Samuels', 'Federation Bio', 'Federation', 'Racquel Bracken', 'Michael Fischbach', 'Senate', 'House', 'Amazon', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Amazon', 'Amazon-Berkshire Hathaway', 'JPMorgan', 'Amazon', 'Racquel Bracken', 'Ethan Batraski', 'Healthcare', 'Venrock’s', 'Healthcare', 'Michelle Zatlyn', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Bryan Roberts', 'Rockefeller', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/zCWnt0qFXH,2021-01-08T20:15:53,Stolen computers are the least of the government’s security worries,"['Reports that a laptop from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office was stolen during the pro-Trump rioters’ sack of the Capitol building has some worried that the mob may have access to important, even classified information. Fortunately that’s not the case — even if this computer and others had any truly sensitive information, which is unlikely, like any corporate asset it can almost certainly be disabled remotely.The cybersecurity threat in general from the riot is not as high as one might think, as we explained yesterday. Specific to stolen or otherwise compromised hardware, there are several facts to keep in mind.Decrypted: How bad was the US Capitol breach for cybersecurity?In the first place, the offices of elected officials are in many ways already public spaces. These are historic buildings through which tours often go, in which meetings with foreign dignitaries and other politicians are held, and in which thousands of ordinary civil servants without any security clearance would normally be working shoulder-to-shoulder. The important work they do is largely legislative and administrative — largely public work, where the most sensitive information being exchanged is probably unannounced speeches and draft bills.But recently, you may remember, most of these people were working from home. Of course during the major event of the joint session confirming the electors, there would be more people than normal. But this wasn’t an ordinary day at the office by a long shot — even before hundreds of radicalized partisans forcibly occupied the building. Chances are there wasn’t a lot of critical business being conducted on the desktops in these offices. Classified data lives in the access-controlled SCIF, not on random devices sitting in unsecured areas.In fact, the laptop is reported by Reuters as having been part of a conference room’s dedicated hardware — this is the dusty old Inspiron that lives on the A/V table so you can put your PowerPoint on it, not Pelosi’s personal computer, let alone a hard line to top secret info.Even if there was a question of unintended access, it should be noted that the federal government, as any large company might, has a normal IT department with a relatively modern provisioning structure. The Pelosi office laptop, like any other piece of hardware being used for official House and Senate business, is monitored by IT and should be able to be remotely disabled or wiped. The challenge for the department is figuring out which hardware does actually need to be handled that way — as was reported earlier, there was (understandably) no official plan for a violent takeover of the Capitol building.In other words, it’s highly likely that the most that will result from the theft of government computers on Jan. 6 will be inconvenience or at most some embarrassment should some informal communications become public. Staffers do gossip and grouse, of course, on both back and official channels.That said, the people who invaded these offices and stole that equipment — some on camera — are already being arrested and charged. Just because the theft doesn’t present a serious security threat doesn’t mean it wasn’t highly illegal in several different ways.Any cybersecurity official will tell you that the greater threat by far is the extensive infiltration of government contractors and accounts through the SolarWinds breach. Those systems are packed with information that was never meant to be public and will likely provide fuel for credential-related attacks for years to come.FBI, NSA say ongoing hacks at US federal agencies ‘likely Russian in origin’']","banned the most prominent of those, controversial subreddit r/The_Donald, ","['NavigationClose ScreenStolen', 'House', 'Nancy Pelosi’s', 'Reuters', 'Inspiron', 'House', 'Senate', 'SolarWinds', 'FBI', 'NSA', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'House', 'Nancy Pelosi’s', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

In its review, the NHTSA analyzed the 232 SUA complaints Sparks provided to the agency, as well as 14 other complaints and all available crash data.The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation has now determined that all of the crashes involving SUA that Sparks cited were caused by the driver. Therefore, the NHTSA is denying Sparks’ petition to formally review 662,109 vehicles and potentially recall them.“There is no evidence of any fault in the accelerator pedal assemblies, motor control systems, or brake systems that has contributed to any of the cited incidents,” the report states. “There is no evidence of a design factor contributing to increased likelihood of pedal misapplication. The theory provided of a potential electronic cause of SUA in the subject vehicles is based upon inaccurate assumptions about system design and log data.”Tesla had previously denied the claims, calling the petition “completely false” and outing Sparks as a Tesla short-seller.“We investigate every single incident where the driver alleges to us that their vehicle accelerated contrary to their input, and in every case where we had the vehicle’s data, we confirmed that the car operated as designed,” the company said last January. “In other words, the car accelerates if, and only if, the driver told it to do so, and it slows or stops when the driver applies the brake.”The NHTSA’s investigation confirmed Tesla’s own findings.

Delivering 500,000 cars in 2020, a full 75% of GM’s third-quarter deliveries, is impressive as well.I am certainly not arguing that Tesla is worthless, or that the group of companies like those that comprise the ARK Innovation ETF, are all overpriced. Instead, it seems that today’s market is willing to value stocks not on their past performance, current performance or analyst-expected future performance but on the rosiest future that investors have imagined for their favorite companies.You can see elements of this logic at work if you ever talk about stocks on the internet. Don’t call Tesla a car company, for example — this despite automotive revenues making up nearly 87% of the company’s Q3 top line. Tesla is a battery company, its religious fans will tell you.That’s why it’s fine to pay 31x sales for Tesla, while GM is worth 0.5348x sales today. Amazon, for comparison, is worth 4.6x sales. Tesla shares are valued like Twilio’s own in terms of their price-sales ratio, but the difference is that the car company had gross margins of 23.5% in Q3 2020, while the software company managed twice that.

The testing is still being conducted in a limited geographic area in San Francisco and in one of the city’s less congested neighborhoods, but it is still viewed as a milestone for the company and a necessary step to secure a permit to launch a shared, commercial service that can charge for rides.West comes to Cruise with more than 12 years pf experience running a massive global operation that had an annual $16 billion budget. During his tenure, he helped Delta grow its earnings per share by more than 15% year-over-year, and led the company’s merger integration with Northwest Airlines.Cruise CEO Dan Ammann, who was president of GM until 2018, said West’s track record of customer experience, operating performance and safety at a large scale makes him “a perfect fit for Cruise as we begin the journey to commercialize our self-driving technology.”Cruise had once\xa0aimed to launch a commercial service using so-called “driverless” vehicles by the end of 2019, but backed off of that timeline — a decision that came after several other autonomous vehicle companies delayed their own plans to launch ride-hailing services that use autonomous vehicles. Cruise has yet to publicly provide a new date for launching a commercial service, the first of which will be in San Francisco.Cruise, which is also backed by SoftBank Vision Fund and T. Rowe Price & Associates, has hundreds of autonomous vehicles in its fleet — however, most still have a human safety operator behind the wheel. In November, Cruise started driverless testing — nomenclature meaning the human safety operator has been removed from the driver’s seat — with a fleet of five autonomous vehicles. The rest of Cruise’s fleet is being used to perform its regular testing with a human safety driver, some of which are used to deliver goods to area food banks.The California DMV, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicle testing in the state, issued Cruise a permit in October that allows the company to test five autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets within San Francisco. Cruise has had a permit to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers behind the wheel since 2015.In February, Cruise received a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission allowing it to transport passengers in its autonomous vehicles in the state. The CPUC modified its regulations late last year to allow properly permitted companies the ability to charge for shared driverless rides.Robotaxi companies get the green light to charge for rides in CaliforniaCruise has to show data that it tested driverless rides for a 30-day period\xa0before it can qualify for the CPUC permit, according to information\xa0on the CPUC website.West’s hiring comes as that 30-day timeline ends. The executive will be responsible for all of Cruise’s commercial operations, an enterprise that will include managing a fleet of hundreds of vehicles and customer service.“Cruise is leading the way to change lives and up-end the status quo of transportation,” West said in a statement. “There will be no bigger shift in the transportation industry in my lifetime than the move to self-driving. I’ve been training my entire career for an opportunity like this one.”']",first to report,"['Delta', 'COO', 'NavigationClose', 'Delta', 'COO', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'CruiseCruise', 'GM', 'Delta Air Lines’', 'Gil West', 'Delta', 'Cruise', 'Cruise', 'Delta', 'Northwest Airlines', 'Dan Ammann', 'GM', 'Cruise', 'SoftBank Vision Fund', 'T.

Reddit this morning confirmed that it shut down the r/donaldtrump subreddit due to “repeated policy violations” on the forum since Wednesday.A spokesperson for the site tells TechCrunch:Reddit’s site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate, or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence against groups of people or individuals. In accordance with this, we have been proactively reaching out to moderators to remind them of our policies and to offer support or resources as needed. We have also taken action to ban the community r/donaldtrump given repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the U.S. Capitol.”While r/donaldtrump didn’t approach the infamy of some other pro-Trump subreddits, the site was a current hub for the Stop the Steal movement. The subreddit also encouraged people to attend the D.C. rally that turned into deadly violence at the Capitol: A side banner on r/donaldtrump showed an image of President Trump as Uncle Sam. “POTUS wants you in D.C. on 1/06/21” it read.Reddit declined to provide more specifics about why the subreddit was removed, but did note that its actions against r/donaldtrump were isolated and no other subreddits were banned today. The subreddit was not related to President Trump in any official capacity.Prior to the invasion of the Capitol, many Trump supporters attended Trump’s own event, a rally near the White House. While that event was stationary around a stage, Trump eventually encouraged its attendees to march toward Congress to continue expressing their outrage at the election results.Reddit has historically hosted large pro-Trump communities known for their toxic behavior and open violent threats against public figures. Last June, Reddit banned the most prominent of those, controversial subreddit r/The_Donald, amid a larger sweep of pages. A year prior, Reddit quarantined r/The_Donald, making it more difficult to discover and requiring an opt-in screen for anyone seeking to visit.Reddit’s decision to close the hub for Trump supporters follows several other de-platformings on major services, including Facebook, Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and Shopify.Trump suspended from Twitch, as Reddit bans the ‘The_Donald’ and additional subreddits']",Taiwan Excellence awards,"['NavigationClose ScreenReddit', 'CapitolBrian Heater', 'Taylor Hatmaker', 'Yasin Ozturk', 'Getty ImagesDays', 'Donald Trump’s', 'pro-Trump', 'Reddit’s', 'Trump', 'Uncle Sam', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trump’s', 'Trump', 'Congress', 'Reddit', 'The_Donald', 'The_Donald', 'Reddit’s', 'Trump', 'Twitch', 'Twitch', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'CapitolBrian Heater', 'Taylor Hatmaker7:37', 'Donald Trump’s', 'pro-Trump', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/Wp4IXIB9TU,2021-01-08T17:19:16,GM launches new logo to show it’s serious about an electric future,"['General Motors has changed its logo, refreshed its website and kicked off a new “Everybody In” marketing campaign as part of a broader effort to illustrate the company’s transformation to a modern, fast-moving and inclusive organization that is serious about accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles.The changes were unveiled Friday as part of GM’s presence at the virtual 2021 CES tech trade show that officially begins January 11. The restyled website will go live January 11.“This is the fifth time GM has changed its logo in its 115-year history and probably the most progressive thing that we’ve done since 1964,” GM chief marketing officer Deborah Wahl said in a press call with reporters Friday. The all-cap GM logo has changed to a lowercase “gm” with a softer blue gradient evoking clean skies of a zero emissions future and an underline below the “m,” a nod to GM’s underlying Ultium battery architecture. The negative space around the “m” even looks like an electrical plug, said Wahl.“It’s optimistic, it brings energy and vibrancy and reflects our view of the future,” she said. “It does build on our strong heritage, with a key element of recognizable consistency and trust. But overall, it really wants to humanize our company and this brand identity project was actually led in-house by a team of our designers who took it on knowing that it represents all 164,000 of our employees.”Surfer Bethany Hamilton in a new ad campaign by GM that launched in January 2021.The effort is meant to be more than just a logo change and a slew of new ads that feature everyday folks alongside cameos from author Malcolm Gladwell, surfer Bethany Hamilton, gamer Erin A. Simon and Peloton cycling instructor Cody Rigsby. It’s meant to show a company that has truly evolved from a slow-moving legacy automaker to one that can be nimble, tech-centric and appealing to the next-generation of car owners.GM wants to inspire; and these changes are meant to kick off its makeover.Of course, there is real money and resources behind this evolution. GM said in November it will spend\xa0$27 billion over the next five years on the development of electric vehicles and automated technology, a 35% increase that exceeds the automaker’s investment in gas and diesel and is an effort to bring products to market faster.GM reveals ‘Ultium,’ the heart of its EV strategyMore than half of GM’s capital spending and product development team will be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs, the company said at the time.The U.S. automaker is also accelerating its go-to-market timeline and adding more EVs to its portfolio plans. GM plans to bring 30 new electric vehicles to a global market through 2025. The company had previously committed to 20 EVs by 2023. More than two-thirds of those launches will be available in North America and every one of GM’s brands, including Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet and Buick, will be represented, according to the automaker.']",Share on Twitter ,"['GM', 'NavigationClose', 'Korosec@kirstenkorosec', 'GMGeneral Motors', 'GM', 'GM', 'GM', 'Deborah Wahl', 'GM', 'GM', 'Bethany Hamilton', 'GM', 'Malcolm Gladwell', 'Bethany Hamilton', 'Erin A.

https://t.co/3HrvcjY8Uv,2021-01-08T17:49:03,Jumbotail raises $14.2 million for its wholesale marketplace in India,"['Jumbotail, an online wholesale marketplace for grocery and food items, said on Friday it has raised an additional $14.2 million as the Bangalore-based startup chases the opportunity to digitize neighborhood stores in the world’s second-largest internet market.The five-year-old startup said the new tranche of its Series B financing round was led by VII Ventures, with participation from Nutresa, Veronorte, Jumbofund, Klinkert Investment Trust, Peter Crosby Trust, Nexus Venture Partners and Discovery Ventures.The startup told TechCrunch that the new tranche concludes its Series B round, which it kickstarted in 2019 with a tranche of $12.7 million. It ended up raising about $44 million in the Series B round (including Friday’s tranche), and to date has amassed about $54 million in equity investment, the startup told the publication.Jumbotail said it serves more than 30,000 neighborhood stores (popularly known in India as kiranas) in the country. In addition to its business-to-business marketplace, the startup also provides working capital to neighborhood stores through partnerships with financial institutions.Indian B2B e-commerce startup Udaan raises $280 millionThe startup, which has built its own supply chain network to enable last-mile delivery, also supplies these stores with point-of-sale devices so they can easily get access to a much wider selection of catalog and have the new inventory shipped to them within two days. It also integrates these stores with hyperlocal delivery startups such as Dunzo and Swiggy to help mom and pop shops further expand their customer base.Ashish Jhina, co-founder of Jumbotail, said he believes the startup has reached an inflection point in its growth and is now ready for its next chapter, which includes hiring top talent and expanding to more regions in the country, especially in several cities in South India.“We are seeing tremendous interest from investors across the globe who are drawn to our highly scalable and operationally profitable business model, built on the industry’s best technology and customer NPS,” said Jhina.At a recent virtual conference, Jhina said that the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to order a nationwide lockdown and\xa0put restrictions on e-commerce firms, has illustrated just how crucial neighborhood stores are in people’s lives. And for all the ills that the virus has wrought, it did help accelerate the adoption of technology among these stores.A number of food brands whose products neighborhood stores sell today are not standardized, which poses a question about their quality. To fill this gap, Jumbotail runs its own private label portfolio and Jhina said the startup will deploy part of the fresh fund to broaden this catalog. Having a private label also allows Jumbotail to ensure that its retail partners can get the supply of items throughout the year — and of course, it also helps the startup, which has been operationally profitable for nearly three quarters, improve its margin.There are more than 30 million neighborhood stores in India located across the thousands of cities and towns in the country. These small businesses have been around for decades and survived — and even thrived — despite e-commerce giants pouring billions of dollars in India to change how people shop. In recent years, scores of startups — and giants — in India have begun to explore ways to work with these neighborhood stores.One of them is India’s largest retail chain Reliance Retail, which serves more than 3.5 million customers each week through its nearly 10,000 physical stores in more than 6,500 cities and towns in the country. In late 2019, it entered the e-commerce space with JioMart through a joint venture with sister subsidiary telecom giant Jio Platforms. By mid last year, JioMart had expanded to over 200 Indian cities and towns\xa0— though currently its reach within those cities and customer service leave a lot to be desired.Reliance Retail also maintains a\xa0partnership with Facebook for WhatsApp integration. Facebook, which invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms last year, has said that it will explore various ways to work with Reliance to digitize the nation’s mom and pop stores, as well as other small and medium-sized businesses.For JioMart, Reliance Retail is working with neighborhood shops, giving them a digital point-of-sale machine to make it easier for them to accept money electronically. It is also allowing these shops to buy their inventory from Reliance Retail, and then use their physical presence as delivery points. At present, the platform is largely focused on grocery delivery. In a recent report to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that Reliance could become the largest player in online grocery within three years.Facebook invests $5.7B in India’s Reliance Jio Platforms']",raised $520 million in an epic Series H,"['Jumbotail', 'NavigationClose ScreenJumbotail', 'JumbotailJumbotail', 'VII Ventures', 'Klinkert Investment Trust', 'Peter Crosby Trust', 'Nexus Venture Partners', 'Discovery Ventures', 'Jumbotail', 'Udaan', 'Swiggy', 'Jumbotail', 'NPS', 'Jumbotail', 'Jumbotail', 'Reliance Retail', 'JioMart', 'Jio Platforms', 'JioMart', 'Reliance Retail', 'WhatsApp', 'Jio Platforms', 'Reliance', 'JioMart', 'Reliance Retail', 'Reliance Retail', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Reliance', 'Reliance Jio PlatformsclosePlease', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'PlatformsJumbotailNexus Venture PartnersReliance', 'IndiaManish Singh6:49 PM', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

https://t.co/7bcaDyjXdU,2021-01-08T15:47:10,Bitcoin advocates revolt against the Trump administration’s frantic crypto regulations,"['Leigh CuenContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tLeigh Cuen is a reporter in New York City. Her work has been published by Vice, Business Insider, Newsweek, Teen Vogue, Al Jazeera English, The Jerusalem Post, and many others. Follow her on Instagram at @leighcuen.\tMore posts by this contributorMeet the entrepreneurs bringing bitcoin to institutionsHow Bitcoin is helping middle-class users survive the pandemicBitcoin fans across the country are rallying against a common enemy, the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of President Donald Trump’s closest associates, has been working overtime since Thanksgiving to push several crypto regulations through before the Biden administration takes over on January 20, 2021.FinCEN statements list the usual reasons for financial regulations, an effort to curtail terror financing, sanctions evasion and black market activity related to drugs and weapons, without any mention of new evidence justifying the unusual urgency.These include a FinCEN proposal that would require exchanges to store records involving transactions over $3,000 sent to any personal wallets, plus report users to FinCEN for cumulative transactions worth more than $10,000 in a single day. For comparison, banks are required to flag cash withdrawals over $10,000, not transactions within the banking system itself, and banks are not required to keep tabs on where the customer spends the cash taken out of the system.Plus, a complementary FinCEN statement proposed requiring Americans to report crypto holdings worth more than $10,000 at any foreign service provider. Although the details of this second initiative are still vague, it’s clear the Treasury wants to make special note of the know-your-customer information for anyone dealing with thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin.The Electronic Frontier Foundation called this a “push for more financial surveillance” without any need for warrants or suspicion. (Bitcoin users already need to report their holdings in their taxes, just like any other asset.) As such, over 65,615 crypto advocates submitted critical statements to FinCEN, including companies like Fidelity and Square. Square’s statement said the company “would be required to collect unreliable data about people [recipients] who have not opted into our service or signed up as our customers.”The Washington D.C. nonprofit Coin Center issued a statement saying this proposal would also limit American access to decentralized services, where users may not know their counterparty or network operators. Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center’s research director, told TechCrunch the proposal is highly unusual because it only allowed for 15 days of comments, instead of the standard 60-day period, for a rule that would impose more data collection requirements on crypto companies than other financial institutions.Is rising usage driving crypto’s recent price boom?“It requires the exchange to collect, retain and report extra information that they don’t have to for a cash transaction, like the name and physical address of a counterparty,” he said. “It’s on a timeline to complete this process, as far as we know right now, before the new administration. That means the rule would be final. The new administration could issue a new rule, and overturn that past rule, but that’s a much more difficult process.”Incoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, sworn in the first week of January, tweeted it was “ridiculous” for the Treasury to have this unusually short comment period. Likewise, nine members of Congress issued a letter warning this hasty rulemaking over the winter holidays undermined the legitimacy of the process.These proposals aren’t just sudden, they’re also so vague that they appear poorly researched. Both Square Crypto developer Matt Corallo and MIT Media Lab director Neha Narula issued public statements saying the FinCEN proposals confused basic technical concepts about how bitcoin addresses work. This would make such regulations difficult to implement, burdening American companies with prohibitively high compliance precautions.“Political motivations are always hard to discern, but public rumors have consistently indicated this is a personal push by Mnuchin, not further up or down,” Corallo said. “We’ll learn a lot about what the next few years look like based on what [incoming Secretary Janet] Yellen says and what new leadership at FinCEN looks like. There are a lot of things Yellen could decide, but it would be hard for her to do a worse job of building useful and practical regulations than Mnuchin’s last-minute attempts here.”Van Valkenburgh said his nonprofit, and other crypto industry organizations like it, are prepared to challenge the ruling in court if the Trump administration fails to follow the legislative process. Namely, the Treasury is required to read and consider all of the public comments submitted by January 7, 2021, the arbitrary date set by the rulemakers themselves.“They technically then have the power to issue the final rule, saying they considered all the comments,” he said. “But if it’s obvious that they didn’t consider all the comments, which I feel like it would be if the final rule came out any time before the new administration comes in, it would be very easy to argue in court that the requirement to read and consider all the comments has not been met.”As it stands, Van Valkenburgh said it appears the outgoing administration intends to “saddle” the incoming administration with “chaos.”\xa0\xa0']",SilviaTerra,"['Trump', 'NavigationClose ScreenBitcoin', 'Trump', 'iStock / Getty ImagesLeigh', 'Leigh Cuen', 'Business Insider', 'Newsweek', 'Teen Vogue', 'Al Jazeera English', 'The Jerusalem Post', 'Bitcoin', 'the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network', 'FinCEN).US', 'Treasury', 'Steven Mnuchin', 'Donald Trump', 'Biden', 'Treasury', 'The Electronic Frontier Foundation', 'Fidelity and Square', 'Coin Center', 'Peter Van Valkenburgh', 'Coin Center’s', 'boom?“It', 'Cynthia Lummis', 'Treasury', 'Congress', 'Matt Corallo', 'MIT', 'Neha Narula', 'Janet] Yellen', 'Mnuchin’s', 'Valkenburgh', 'Trump', 'Treasury', 'Van Valkenburgh', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Trump', 'the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/K1T3M2bsRm,2021-01-08T15:35:49,The Roblox Gambit,"['So it turns out that Roblox is worth $29.5 billion.That’s the lesson the market learned this week when the gaming platform company announced that it had raised $520 million in an epic Series H.For a company valued at just $4 billion last February when it raised $150 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz, that new valuation could be considered a victory. But is it?The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it every morning on Extra Crunch, or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.For all the griping amongst private-market capitalists that public-market capitalists are ripping off their investments as they look to cross the private-public divide through an IPO, it’s hard to square a company’s valuation going from $4 billion to nearly $30 billion in just 11 months.Sure, you could argue that Roblox enjoyed an epic 2020, thanks in part to COVID-19. That helped its valuation. But there’s a lot of space between $4 billion and $29.5 billion, and recall that its February Series G valued Roblox at around 7.3x its Q4 2019 revenue run rate.The same company at its new $29.5 billion valuation is now priced at just over 30x its Q3 2020 run rate (the most recent quarter for which we have data today).Perhaps Roblox was right to hold off on its IPO, raise a huge block of cash at a new valuation and pursue a direct listing. But it’s hard to fret heavily about private-market complaints concerning startup value when the IPO facilitators are hardly the only folks making trips to the bank with a wheelbarrow.All that is preamble. This morning, let’s talk about Roblox’s flotation strategy. Why is the company raising private market money and then floating instead of raising public market money on its path to trading as a public company? And does its strategy solve the major flaws that the IPO process appears to have? Let’s get into it.The ol’ raise-and-floatOne way to go public is to file an S-1, prepare a presentation, go on a roadshow, drive interest in your shares and work with bankers to price the shares you want to sell at a dollar amount all parties can agree to. The next morning, your shares begin to trade, and you count the money you raised.That is a traditional IPO, admittedly simplified.There are issues in there, namely that the price discovery mechanism has proved to be uncertain, especially when it comes to the public offerings of companies considered attractive investments by the active retail trading market. Why? The hotter the company, the fewer shares that are available for trade at the start of its life as a public firm — the very opposite of that which is happening on the demand side.Lots of demand, few shares and up goes the price. Then up go the complaints that Wall Street is a bunch of thieves. Hearing this from other capital players is always whimsical to some degree, but let’s stick to our theme.']", launched,"['Nigel Sussman', 'Roblox', 'Andreessen Horowitz', 'Exchange', 'Exchange', 'Roblox', 'Roblox', 'Roblox', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsFundings & ExitsGamingStartupsTCa16zRobloxthe', 'Alex Wilhelm4:35 PM', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/lTNPpEblDa,2021-01-08T15:32:07,5 reforms necessary to create a truly cashless society,"['Wisam DakkaContributorShare on Twitter \n\t\tWisam Dakka is the co-founder of Meemo, a social financial application that offers users automatic AI-powered search, personalized insights, modern peer-to-peer sharing and rewards based on their transaction and purchasing history. \tThe coronavirus pandemic challenged the status quo and completely changed normal life as we knew it. However, with these challenges have come new opportunities to adapt and participate differently in the world. One of the first trends was that cash is no longer accepted.The transition to cashless transactions, which at first seemed minor, made my customer experience seamless. Going wallet-free made me wonder why I ever carried cash at all!Cashless life has been widely adopted in Asian countries for quite some time, but it wasn’t universally adopted across the United States until the coronavirus pandemic. The convenience of cashless transactions just makes sense, but my hope is that this convenience doesn’t come at the cost of other aspects of commerce. \n\t\t\tThe transition to cashless transactions made my customer experience seamless.\t\t\t\t\tInaccessibility, fees and thoughtless spending are some of the potential problems that come to mind with cashless spending. For a truly cashless society, here are five key points for consideration:1. Payment processors currently have the upper hand, forcing fees onto customersFor the sake of a cashless transaction, we have given up our last direct authentic connection with our favorite baristas, small businesses and independent brands. When I take out my credit card or phone to pay, I am not thinking about the fees that both myself and the merchant are paying to facilitate what was once a fee-less transaction. Losing this direct connection with my merchant has given payment processors the upper hand, allowing them to demand an unjustifiable fee of up to 3%.With virtual payments, my cash is essentially in my phone and the barista is directly in front of me, but the transaction does not work like cash. The merchant will need to pay the fee on my transaction. If the cash revenue for that coffee shop used to be 20% of their revenue pre-COVID, they will now need to pay the fees on 20% of their revenue. Sadly, the merchant response over time is to raise prices. Historically, the adoption of a cashless exchange results in fees being passed through to the customer.Through price increases across the board, the customer is always bailing the merchant out for the cost of the electronic, seamless, safer-than-ever money exchange. Furthermore, the customers are even “forced” to tip digitally from predefined settings, removing all meaning of tips as an emotional social contract. This new normal means that customers will end up paying $4 in a digital transaction for a coffee that used to cost $3 in cash.2. Platforms must adapt new models to forgo transaction feesGiven that software and intelligent platforms have always lowered the cost of services when they are used at scale, why has this reduction of cost not yet applied to digital financial transactions? Customers need to demand that cashless transactions operate in the same way as cash transactions.Even if we continue with a fee model, why would regular, loyal and verified customers always pay (directly or indirectly) the hefty cost of the exchange on top of the cost of credit? There should be a differentiation between these different types of transactions, regular or new, and appropriate fees that make sense.3. Product experiences must promote conscious spendingPaying with digital or credit cards almost feels like paying with someone else’s money, which can be a dangerous feeling when considering that the user does not see this money spent instantly. Say your regular coffee costs $3. Paying for that coffee with cash is a very different experience than paying with a card or a digital wallet.When you have a finite amount of cash in your pocket, the physical act (and sometimes mental pain) of spending makes the money feel different and more valuable than the invisible money that you spend via your credit or debit card. In many ways, the silent pain we endure while paying in cash has been subconsciously raising our awareness about our spending.4. Accessibility and use must extend to allThe idea of a cashless society has thus far not been very inclusive to the unbanked and underbanked population. To support a new model, this underserviced sector needs to be able to utilize this software. A user needs to be able to walk into a grocery store and give the cashier $100 for them to upload the money to their virtual wallet.Alternatively, a friend needs to be able to send $100 to their virtual wallet. For a cashless society to work, virtual payments need to work with ease and certainty that they will be accepted at any and all locations, just like cash.5. The path to an open walletHave you ever ordered a $15 meal on a food delivery app, only for the total to end up over $25? Beyond the delivery fee, tips and taxes, delivery apps are pricing in extra fees to offset the fees charged by credit card and payment companies. In an effort to avoid these extra fees, apps like Lyft and Uber have begun deploying their own digital wallets supported by ACH transfers.Sadly, consumers are unlikely to see the benefit until these wallets reach wide adoption, which is clearly not happening because no one wants yet another app-specific wallet.The way forwardTo truly empower the consumer, both Google and Apple should keep developing their digital wallets with an open API payment system to allow all apps to securely interact with it for free. This will transform the Google and Apple wallet and will better service the unbanked and underbanked populations instead of just being a gateway for credit cards.This would further support the unbanked or underbanked population as they too would be able to utilize an open wallet that can be refilled with cash in person. I should be able to use the cash I have in my virtual wallet with any app, website or physical merchant without paying a fee. I should also be able refill the wallet from my bank account or directly deposit some of my paycheck into my phone wallet. Merchants would also benefit from wallet-to-pay by paying no fees to Google and Apple.Instead, the mobile wallet creator could introduce a new business model focused on discovery and connecting users and merchants, charging merchants for the connections that they facilitate.In a not-so-distant future, when I get my new Apple or Google phone, it will have a wallet that can be used without fees for payment across all apps, in physical retail locations, and for peer-to-peer money transfers. The credit cards, or rather lines of credit, on my digital wallet will use an Affirm-like loan service that allows me to buy anything from a pack of gum to a luxury watch or even a car, just using my phone’s wallet.Goldman Sachs and Mastercard should not be the only players in the credit space. Innovation is necessary in the digital wallet space to pioneer the movement to change the outdated fee models for the simple act of money exchange.Venmo adds a check-cashing feature, waives fees for stimulus checks']", launched,"['NavigationClose', 'Dakka@dakka_wisam', 'Getty ImagesWisam DakkaContributorShare', 'Wisam Dakka', 'Meemo', 'AI', 'ACH', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Apple', 'Affirm', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Mastercard', 'Venmo', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Article5', 'Wisam Dakka4:32 PM', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

And this morning, Roku announced that it has indeed reached a deal for the exclusive distribution rights to all of Quibi’s programs.Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.Roku said it will make this content available for free with ads on The Roku Channel. That doesn’t just include the shows that were previously available on Quibi, but also “more than a dozen” programs making “their exclusive debut on The Roku Channel” — in other words, they were created for the service but unreleased due to the app’s shutdown.“Today’s announcement marks a rare opportunity to acquire compelling original content that features some of the biggest names in entertainment,” said Roku’s vice president of programming Rob Holmes in a statement. “We’re excited to make this content available to our users in The Roku Channel through an ad-supported model. We are also thrilled to welcome the incredible studios and talented individuals who brought these stories to life and showcase them to our tens of millions of users.”While Roku is best known for its streaming TV devices and software, advertising is a growing part of its business. And it says The Roku Channel (which offers both free content and subscription channels) reached 61.8 million U.S. viewers in the fourth quarter of last year.Roku introduces a new Ultra player, a 2-in-1 ‘Streambar’ and a new OS with support for AirPlay 2Quibi, meanwhile, announced its shutdown in October, just six months after its splashy launch. The service was focused on creating video episodes that lasted 10 minutes or less and were designed for viewing on-the-go — a poor fit for a period of pandemic and lockdowns.In their farewell note, executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman suggested that the service failed due to a combination of bad timing and the fact that “the idea itself wasn’t strong enough to justify a standalone streaming service.”“The most creative and imaginative minds in Hollywood created groundbreaking content for Quibi that exceeded our expectations,” Katzenberg said in today’s announcement. “We are thrilled that these stories, from the surreal to the sublime, have found a new home on The Roku Channel.”It’s also worth noting that the service was initially focused entirely on mobile viewing, with no way to watch the shows on smart TVs. That eventually changed, starting with the addition of AirPlay support.

https://t.co/S7DQUiPjf5,2021-01-08T14:33:25,SilviaTerra wants to bring the benefits of carbon offsets to every landowner everywhere,"['Zack Parisa and Max Nova, the co-founders of the carbon offset company SilviaTerra, have spent the last decade working on a way to democratize access to revenue-generating carbon offsets.As forestry credits become a big, booming business on the back of multibillion-dollar commitments from some of the world’s biggest companies to decarbonize their businesses, the kinds of technologies that the two founders have dedicated 10 years of their lives to building are only going to become more valuable.That’s why their company, already a profitable business, has raised $4.4 million in outside funding led by Union Square Ventures and Version One Ventures, along with Salesforce founder and the driving force between the One Trillion Trees Initiative, Marc Benioff.“Key to addressing the climate crisis is changing the balance in the so-called carbon cycle. At present, every year we are adding roughly 5 gigatons of carbon to the atmosphere. Since atmospheric carbon acts as a greenhouse gas this increases the energy that’s retained rather than radiated back into space which causes the earth to heat up,” writes Union Square Ventures managing partner Albert Wenger in a blog post. “There will be many ways such drawdown occurs and we will write about different approaches in the coming weeks (such as direct air capture and growing kelp in the oceans). One way that we understand well today and can act upon immediately are forests. The world’s forests today absorb a bit more than one gigatons of CO2 per year out of the atmosphere and turn it into biomass. We need to stop cutting and burning down existing forests (including preventing large scale forest fires) and we have to start planting more new trees. If we do that, the total potential for forests is around 4 to 5 gigatons per year (with\xa0some estimates as high as 9 gigatons).”For the two founders, the new funding is the latest step in a long journey that began in the woods of Northern Alabama, where Parisa grew up.After attending Mississippi State for forestry, Parisa went to graduate school at Yale, where he met Louisville, Kentucky native Max Nova, a computer science student who joined with Parisa to set up the company that would become SilviaTerra.SilviaTerra co-founders Max Nova and Zack Parisa. Image Credit: SilviaTerraThe two men developed a way to combine satellite imagery with field measurements to determine the size and species of trees in every acre of forest.While the first step was to create a map of every forest in the U.S., the ultimate goal for both men was to find a way to put a carbon market on equal footing with the timber industry. Instead of cutting trees for cash, potentially landowners could find out how much it would be worth to maintain their forestland. As the company notes, forest management had previously been driven by the economics of timber harvesting, with over $10 billion spent in the U.S. each year.The founders at SilviaTerra thought that the carbon market could be equally as large, but it’s hard for most landowners to access. Carbon offset projects can cost as much as $200,000 to put together, which is more than the value of the smaller offset projects for landowners like Parisa’s own family and the 40 acres they own in the Alabama forests.Yayzy app automatically calculates the environmental impact of your spendingThere had to be a better way for smaller landowners to benefit from carbon markets too, Parisa and Nova thought.To create this carbon economy, there needed to be a single source of record for every tree in the U.S. and while SilviaTerra had the technology to make that map, they lacked the compute power, machine learning capabilities and resources to build the map.That’s where Microsoft’s AI for Earth program came in.Working with AI for Earth, SilviaTierra created their first product, Basemap, to process terabytes of satellite imagery to determine the sizes and species of trees on every acre of America’s forestland. The company also worked with the U.S. Forestry Service to access their data, which was used in creating this holistic view of the forest assets in the U.S.With the data from Basemap in hand, the company has created what it calls the Natural Capital Exchange. This program uses SilviaTerra’s unparalleled access to information about local forests, and the knowledge of how those forests are currently used to supply projects that actually represent land that would have been forested were it not for the offset money coming in.Currently, many forestry projects are being passed off to offset buyers as legitimate offsets on land that would never have been forested in the first place — rendering the project meaningless and useless in any real way as an offset for carbon dioxide emissions.\xa0“It’s a bloodbath out there,” said Nova of the scale of the problem with fraudulent offsets in the industry. “We’re not repackaging existing forest carbon projects and trying to connect the demand side with projects that already exist. Use technology to unlock a new supply of forest carbon offset.”The first Natural Capital Exchange project was actually launched and funded by Microsoft back in 2019. In it, 20 Western Pennsylvania land owners originated forest carbon credits through the program, showing that the offsets could work for landowners with 40 acres, or, as the company said, 40,000.Landowners involved in SilviaTerra’s pilot carbon offset program paid for by Microsoft. Image Credit: SilviaTerra“We’re just trying to get inside every landowners annual economic planning cycle,” said Nova. “There’s a whole field of timber economics… and we’re helping answer the question of given the price of timber, given the price of carbon does it make sense to reduce your planned timber harvests?”Ultimately, the two founders believe that they’ve found a way to pay for the total land value through the creation of data around the potential carbon offset value of these forests.It’s more than just carbon markets, as well. The tools that SilviaTerra have created can be used for wildfire mitigation as well. “We’re at the right place at the right time with the right data and the right tools,” said Nova. “It’s about connecting that data to the decision and the economics of all this.”The launch of the SilviaTerra exchange gives large buyers a vetted source to offset carbon. In some ways it’s an enterprise corollary to the work being done by startups like Wren, another Union Square Ventures investment, that focuses on offsetting the carbon footprint of everyday consumers. It’s also a competitor to companies like Pachama, which are trying to provide similar forest offsets at scale, or 3Degrees Inc. or South Pole.Under a Biden administration there’s even more of an opportunity for these offset companies, the founders said, given discussions underway to establish a Carbon Bank. Established through the existing Commodity Credit Corp. run by the Department of Agriculture, the Carbon Bank would pay farmers and landowners across the U.S. for forestry and agricultural carbon offset projects.Sequoia picks its horse in the consumer carbon offset market, leading a $2.5 million round for Joro“Everybody knows that there’s more value in these systems than just the product that we harvest off of it,” said Parisa. “Until we put those benefits in the same footing as the things we cut off and send to market…. As the value of these things goes up… absolutely it is going to influence these decisions and it is a cash crop… It’s a money pump from coastal America into middle America to create these things that they need.”\xa0']",told,"['SilviaTerra', 'Marc Benioff', 'Union Square Ventures', 'Roine Magnusson', 'Max Nova', 'SilviaTerra', 'Union Square Ventures and', 'Version One Ventures', 'the One Trillion Trees Initiative', 'Marc Benioff', 'Union Square Ventures', 'Albert Wenger', 'Parisa', 'Parisa', 'Yale', 'Max Nova', 'SilviaTerra', 'Max Nova', 'Zack Parisa', 'SilviaTerra', 'Parisa’s', 'Yayzy', 'Nova', 'SilviaTerra', 'Microsoft’s', 'AI', 'SilviaTierra', 'the U.S. Forestry Service', 'the Natural Capital Exchange', 'SilviaTerra’s', 'Nova', 'Natural Capital Exchange', 'Microsoft', 'SilviaTerra', 'Microsoft', 'Nova', '’ve', 'SilviaTerra', 'Nova', 'SilviaTerra', 'Wren', 'Union Square Ventures', 'Pachama', 'Biden', 'a Carbon Bank', 'Commodity Credit Corp.', 'the Department of Agriculture', 'the Carbon Bank', 'Parisa', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'ArticleSilviaTerra', 'Parisa', 'Max Nova', 'SilviaTerra', 'Jonathan Shieber3:33', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/raeIiNcouD,2021-01-08T14:23:34,Google’s plan to replace tracking cookies goes under UK antitrust probe,"['Google’s plan to end support for third-party cookies in the Chrome browser and its Chromium engine is under investigation by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).The antitrust regulator said today that it’s\xa0launched a probe under Chapter II of the U.K.’s Competition Act 1998 into “suspected breaches of competition law by Google”.The move follows a complaint lodged in November by a coalition of digital marketing companies which urged the CMA to block Google’s implementation of the self-styled “Privacy Sandbox”.The CMA also received complaints from newspapers and technology companies alleging the tech giant is abusing a dominance position, it added.Digital marketing firms file UK competition complaint against Google’s Privacy SandboxA Google spokesperson sent this statement in response to a request for comment on the CMA investigation:Creating a more private web, while also enabling the publishers and advertisers who support the free and open internet, requires the industry to make major changes to the way digital advertising works. The Privacy Sandbox has been an open initiative since the beginning and we welcome the CMA’s involvement as we work to develop new proposals to underpin a healthy, ad-supported web without third-party cookies.Google had previously said it would implement the Sandbox in 2021 — accelerating an earlier timeline for the phasing out of third-party cookies and sending ripples of fear (and loathing) through an adtech industry that bet the farm on mass surveillance of internet users.No changes have been made so far, according to Google.It also said today that any changes will not be made before 2022 — as it continues a process of public collaboration (now coupled with close regulatory engagement, via the CMA) on how to replace tracking cookies.With the looming demise of third-party cookies, digital marketers are concerned about their ability to target ads at web users as browsers decommission support for key tracking technologies.But it’s worth noting that Google’s Chrome is actually the laggard in proposing to pull the plug on tracking cookies; WebKit, which underpins Safari, announced a tracking prevention policy back in 2019 — taking inspiration from Mozilla’s earlier anti-tracking stance. (The latter made third-party cookie blocking in Firefox the default in September of the same year.)These anti-tracking plays by browser-makers are, on one level, a response to consumer distaste over creepy ads and concern for their online privacy.And in the European Union at least, many core elements of adtech infrastructure are subject to complaints and remain under regulatory scrutiny. (Albeit, the U.K.’s data protection regulator, the ICO, is currently being sued for failing to act on complaints about the lawfulness of real-time bidding which date back to September 2018.)UK’s ICO faces legal action after closing adtech complaint with nothing to show for itBut the contention by the marketing, publishing and adtech businesses which are crying foul over the end of cookies is that tech giants — Google in this case — are using privacy as a convenient excuse to increase their market power (and control over user data) at smaller entities’ expense.“The investigation will assess whether the proposals could cause advertising spend to become even more concentrated on Google’s ecosystem at the expense of its competitors,” the CMA writes in a press release announcing its investigation. “It follows complaints of anticompetitive behaviour and requests for the CMA to ensure that Google develops its proposals in a way that does not distort competition.”The announcement also makes clear that the regulator is alive to the genuine issue of privacy concern — with the CMA writing that it’s been “considering how best to address legitimate privacy concerns without distorting competition”. This has included holding discussions with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and talking to Google to “better understand its proposals”, it says.“The current investigation will provide a framework for the continuation of this work, and, potentially, a legal basis for any solution that emerges”, the CMA adds.Exactly what will replace tracking cookies is still very much up in the air.Google has made a number of proposals, via the W3C standards forum, including one called “Dovekey”, which suggests using a key value server and which Google says builds on the feedback and proposal from adtech firm Criteo’s Sparrow proposal.It’s also shared the algorithms for its Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) proposal — referring to a suggestion to use a specific machine learning technique to allow behavioral ad targeting to continue (but without needing to collect individuals’ data).The wider adtech industry, meanwhile, has also been coming up with various ideas and offers for replacing tracking cookies.

https://t.co/6JxaJi8hRH,2021-01-08T14:23:34,Google’s plan to replace tracking cookies goes under UK antitrust probe,"['Google’s plan to end support for third-party cookies in the Chrome browser and its Chromium engine is under investigation by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).The antitrust regulator said today that it’s\xa0launched a probe under Chapter II of the U.K.’s Competition Act 1998 into “suspected breaches of competition law by Google”.The move follows a complaint lodged in November by a coalition of digital marketing companies which urged the CMA to block Google’s implementation of the self-styled “Privacy Sandbox”.The CMA also received complaints from newspapers and technology companies alleging the tech giant is abusing a dominance position, it added.Digital marketing firms file UK competition complaint against Google’s Privacy SandboxA Google spokesperson sent this statement in response to a request for comment on the CMA investigation:Creating a more private web, while also enabling the publishers and advertisers who support the free and open internet, requires the industry to make major changes to the way digital advertising works. The Privacy Sandbox has been an open initiative since the beginning and we welcome the CMA’s involvement as we work to develop new proposals to underpin a healthy, ad-supported web without third-party cookies.Google had previously said it would implement the Sandbox in 2021 — accelerating an earlier timeline for the phasing out of third-party cookies and sending ripples of fear (and loathing) through an adtech industry that bet the farm on mass surveillance of internet users.No changes have been made so far, according to Google.It also said today that any changes will not be made before 2022 — as it continues a process of public collaboration (now coupled with close regulatory engagement, via the CMA) on how to replace tracking cookies.With the looming demise of third-party cookies, digital marketers are concerned about their ability to target ads at web users as browsers decommission support for key tracking technologies.But it’s worth noting that Google’s Chrome is actually the laggard in proposing to pull the plug on tracking cookies; WebKit, which underpins Safari, announced a tracking prevention policy back in 2019 — taking inspiration from Mozilla’s earlier anti-tracking stance. (The latter made third-party cookie blocking in Firefox the default in September of the same year.)These anti-tracking plays by browser-makers are, on one level, a response to consumer distaste over creepy ads and concern for their online privacy.And in the European Union at least, many core elements of adtech infrastructure are subject to complaints and remain under regulatory scrutiny. (Albeit, the U.K.’s data protection regulator, the ICO, is currently being sued for failing to act on complaints about the lawfulness of real-time bidding which date back to September 2018.)UK’s ICO faces legal action after closing adtech complaint with nothing to show for itBut the contention by the marketing, publishing and adtech businesses which are crying foul over the end of cookies is that tech giants — Google in this case — are using privacy as a convenient excuse to increase their market power (and control over user data) at smaller entities’ expense.“The investigation will assess whether the proposals could cause advertising spend to become even more concentrated on Google’s ecosystem at the expense of its competitors,” the CMA writes in a press release announcing its investigation. “It follows complaints of anticompetitive behaviour and requests for the CMA to ensure that Google develops its proposals in a way that does not distort competition.”The announcement also makes clear that the regulator is alive to the genuine issue of privacy concern — with the CMA writing that it’s been “considering how best to address legitimate privacy concerns without distorting competition”. This has included holding discussions with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and talking to Google to “better understand its proposals”, it says.“The current investigation will provide a framework for the continuation of this work, and, potentially, a legal basis for any solution that emerges”, the CMA adds.Exactly what will replace tracking cookies is still very much up in the air.Google has made a number of proposals, via the W3C standards forum, including one called “Dovekey”, which suggests using a key value server and which Google says builds on the feedback and proposal from adtech firm Criteo’s Sparrow proposal.It’s also shared the algorithms for its Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) proposal — referring to a suggestion to use a specific machine learning technique to allow behavioral ad targeting to continue (but without needing to collect individuals’ data).The wider adtech industry, meanwhile, has also been coming up with various ideas and offers for replacing tracking cookies. Such as the UnifiedOpen ID 2.0 proposal (that’s being built by The Trade Desk) and proposes a centralized system for tracking internet users based on personal data such as an email address or phone number; or the Unified ID service launched by TechCrunch’s parent Verizon Media (leveraging its access to first-party data), to name just two.So whatever replaces tracking cookies looks unlikely to be simple or singular.

https://t.co/mODfQywppY,2021-01-08T13:52:00,Chris Krebs and Alex Stamos have started a cyber consulting firm,"['Former U.S. cybersecurity official Chris Krebs and former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos have founded a new cybersecurity consultancy firm, which already has its first client: SolarWinds.The two have been hired as consultants to help the Texas-based software maker recover from a devastating breach by suspected Russian hackers, which used the company’s software to set backdoors in thousands of organizations and to infiltrate at least 10 U.S. federal agencies and several Fortune 500 businesses.At least the Treasury Dept., State Dept. and the Department of Energy have been confirmed breached, in what has been described as likely the most significant espionage campaign against the U.S. government in years. And while the U.S. government has already pinned the blame on Russia, the scale of the intrusions are not likely to be known for some time.Krebs was one of the most senior cybersecurity officials in the U.S. government, most recently serving as the director of Homeland Security’s CISA cybersecurity advisory agency from 2018, until he was fired by President Trump for his efforts to debunk false election claims — many of which came from the president himself. Stamos, meanwhile, joined the Stanford Internet Observatory after holding senior cybersecurity positions at Facebook and Yahoo. He also consulted for Zoom amid a spate of security problems.In an interview with the Financial Times, which broke the story, Krebs said it could take years before the hackers are ejected from infiltrated systems.SolarWinds chief executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna acknowledged in a blog post that it had brought on the consultants to help the embattled company to be “transparent with our customers, our government partners, and the general public in both the near-term and long-term about our security enhancements.”Just how bad is that hack that hit US government agencies?']",wait 12 hours,"['Chris Krebs', 'Alex Stamos', 'NavigationClose', 'Alex Stamos', 'Tasos Katopodis', 'Win McNamee', 'Chris Krebs', 'Alex Stamos', 'SolarWinds', 'Treasury', 'State', 'the Department of Energy', 'Krebs', 'Homeland Security’s', 'Trump', 'Stamos', 'Facebook and Yahoo', 'Zoom', 'the Financial Times', 'Krebs', 'SolarWinds', 'Sudhakar Ramakrishna', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Share LinkCopy Share', 'StamosChris Krebscomputer securitycybercrimeCyberwarfaredata securityDepartment', 'Krebs', 'Alex Stamos', 'Chris Krebs', 'Alex Stamos', 'SolarWin', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/ycnsrZOLWN,2021-01-08T03:49:57,Tencent investment stays on game in 2020,"['It’s no secret that Tencent, the Chinese tech giant behind WeChat and a handful of blockbuster video games, is an aggressive investor. Even during 2020 when the pandemic slowed down economic activity in many parts of the world, Tencent was charging ahead with its investment ambitions.During the year, the company participated in more than 170 funding rounds that amounted to a total of 249.5 million yuan ($38 million), according to the Chinese startup database ITJuzi. That made 2020 the most active year to date for Tencent’s investment team, which had been delivering superior results in the last decade.By January 2020, more than 70 of Tencent’s 800 portfolio companies had gone public and more than 160 of them surpassed $100 million in valuation, Martin Lau, Tencent’s president, told a room of investees at the time. The achievement could well place Tencent side by side with some of the world’s top venture funds.Tencent established an investment and M&A unit back in 2008 and began to seriously ramp up financing around 2012. Since 2015, it has been funding more than 100 companies per year, ITJuzi data shows. The social and entertainment giant has for long kept its funding activity close to its chest and data gleaned by third-party organizations like ITJuzi is often not exhaustive. The company did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s questions about its investment in 2020, and the story draws mainly from public disclosures and interviews with people of knowledge.B2B interestWhile Tencent’s overall investment strategy has remained consistent — a diversifying portfolio with a focus on digital entertainment — it has quietly stepped up efforts in areas outside its main gaming arena. For instance, the firm has paid more attention to enterprise services ever since it announced a B2B pivot in 2018, putting more focus on cloud computing, fintech and the likes. The number of investments it made in enterprise software went from five in 2015 to 28 in 2020, according to ITJuzi.In line with its new focus on enterprise, Tencent has also upped its game in fintech. In 2019 and 2020, it backed 18 and 15 fintech startups, respectively, ITJuzi shows, up from only four in 2015. The rise, though incremental, reflects the firm’s increased interest in an area that’s both hugely lucrative but also comes with many constraints.In China, Tencent has long been competing with Ant Group, the Alibaba fintech affiliate, to court users in payments, lending, wealth management and even insurance. The regulatory troubles facing Ant are not exclusive to the Jack Ma empire and will likely come to daunt its smaller contenders, including Tencent’s fintech segments.The race to be China’s top fintech platform: Ant vs TencentThat said, Tencent is “not nearly as aggressive” as Ant when it comes to strengthening its position in China’s financial market, a person who partners with Tencent’s overseas fintech business told TechCrunch.Fintech overseasThe company is also prudent with its fintech expansion overseas in times of geopolitical tensions. So far, it’s mostly limited its ambition to providing cross-border payment services to China’s outbound tourists, rather than serving locals directly.“There’s a lot of scrutiny around what Tencent and Alibaba are doing within the United States and that presents challenges,” said the CEO of a Tencent-backed startup based in the U.S. who declined to be named.Through investments, however, Tencent has familiarized itself with the foreign financial markets. In 2015, the company made one fintech investment outside China. In 2020, it funded eight, according to public data collected by Crunchbase.A considerable portion of Tencent’s outside investments doesn’t bear strategic significance, and the company tends to let its portfolio startups operate autonomously. Partly for that reason, Tencent was slammed for prioritizing investment and financial return over product development and innovation in a viral article in 2018, titled ominously “Tencent Has No Dream.” The hands-off attitude is a stark contrast to the stranglehold practice of Alibaba, which prefers buying controlling stakes in businesses and shaking up their top management, as it did for Lazada.But many Tencent investments do add value to its business, even when the press announcements leave out the potential strategic synergies. Over the years, Tencent has made a series of small investments in the U.S. and other Western countries. Few of them appear to bring collaborative opportunities in the near term, but Tencent would still invite executives from these companies to China where they would learn from each other.“Tencent made those investments really just to kind of learn what people are doing in the U.S. and how it might be able to be applied in China,” said the executive from the Tencent-backed startup.“We don’t have any near-term plans to do anything in China. But Tencent is a very reputable name, whether it’s in China or the U.S. And you know, it’s good to have the option to be able to do something more strategic in partnership with Tencent down the road.”Tencent’s fintech investments outside China could also be conducive to the firm’s gaming expansion overseas, according to a Hong Kong-based fund manager. The goal is to have half of its gamers to be overseas users, Tencent pledged in 2019.“For the gaming industry in Latin America and Southeast Asia, the biggest bottleneck is, surprisingly, not hardware but payments,” the fund manager told TechCrunch. “Of course, localization and compatibility are also important.”']",demonstration of the company’s AutoML Tables tool,"['NavigationClose', 'Martin Lau', 'Tencent Holdings Ltd.', 'Ma Huateng', 'Tencent Holdings Ltd.', 'Brent Lewin/Bloomberg', 'Getty ImagesIt’s', 'WeChat', 'ITJuzi', 'Tencent’s', 'Martin Lau', 'Tencent’s', 'ITJuzi', 'ITJuzi', 'ITJuzi', 'ITJuzi', 'Ant Group', 'Ant', 'Jack Ma', 'Tencent’s', 'Ant vs', 'Ant', 'Tencent’s', 'Tencent', 'Crunchbase', 'Tencent’s', 'Lazada', 'Tencent', 'Tencent', 'Tencent', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'WeChat', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
https://t.co/X8AJeSBart,2021-01-08T08:00:37,Jobandtalent tops up with $108M for its ‘workforce as a service’ platform,"['Madrid-based Jobandtalent, a digital temp staffing agency that operates a dual-sided platform that connects temp workers with employers needing regular casual labor in sectors like transport and logistics, has added €88 million (~$108 million) to its Series C — bringing the total raised following an earlier (2019) closing of the round to €166 million.The 2009-founded startup has raised more than $290 million to date over its decade+ run but describes itself as just at the beginning of a journey to make a dent in the massive and growing market for temporary work, expecting demand to keep stepping up as more sectors and processes go digital in the coming years.Jobandtalent says more than 80,000 workers have used its platform to secure temp gigs in the last year across the seven markets where it operates in Europe and LatAm (namely: Spain, U.K., Germany, France, Sweden, Mexico and Colombia); while 750+ employers are signed up to “recurrently manage a large part of their workforce”, as it puts it, including XPO, Ocado, Saint Gobain, Santander, Bayer, eBay, Huawei, Ceva Logistics and Carrefour.It’s focused on competing with traditional staffing agencies such as Adecco and Randstad, though other similar startups are cropping up to cater to an ever more precarious temporary employment market. (Uber, for example, launched a shift-finder app experiment called Works, back in 2019, also targeting demand for on-demand labor — but doing so in partnership with staffing agencies in its case.)Jobandtalent reports the number of workers looking for temp jobs on its platform doubling every year, while it’s grown revenue to €500 million and says it’s hit positive EBITDA.The beefed up Series C funding will be put toward expanding into more markets and doubling down on growing its existing footprint, it said today.“We will keep expanding through Europe and will consider some additional opportunities (the U.S. and some LatAm countries),” co-founder Juan Urdiales told us, noting that its main markets remain Spain and the U.K., while its main sectors are logistics, last mile, warehousing and transport.The lead investor in the expansion tranche of its C round is new investor InfraVia, a French private equity firm, which is putting in €30 million — investing via a Growth Tech Fund it launched last year that’s focused on European B2B high-growth tech companies.Existing Jobandtalent investors, including Atomico, Seek, DN Capital and Kibo Ventures also participated in the Series C top-up.Urdiales said the reason it’s taken in another chunk of funding now is because of increased opportunity for growth as the coronavirus pandemic continues to accelerate demand for temping. “The reason why we are raising more is because we are seeing a high potential now to grow even faster than expected,” he told us. “The pandemic has helped us with both workers and employers in terms of adoption of our platform.”“Covid has accelerated the transformation of many industries. We have seen more adoption of new technologies in the last nine months than in the last five years. The staffing market is experiencing a huge transformation that will be accelerated in the upcoming years, moving from brick and mortar traditional structures to data driven platforms that will improve the experience of both workers and employers,” Urdiales went on in a statement.“This market is really big and we are just in the beginning of our journey (even though we have been a lot of years in the market now),” he added via email, discussing whether an IPO is on the business’ roadmap in the next few years. “We think that if we continue growing at the pace that we are growing now, and we add some private investors to help us with our growth plans, we may stay private for longer.”Jobandtalent has been through a number of pivots since kicking off more than a decade ago with the idea of using technology to streamline the messy and consummately human business of recruitment. It started out testing a number of approaches before settling on a linguistics algorithm to parse job ads and create alerts to loop in passive job seekers.Then in 2016 it pivoted away from enterprise recruitment to focus on mobilizing hiring for SMEs — zeroing in on the growing opportunity for temp job-matching offered by the rise of gig work fuelled by smartphone apps. From there, it’s been honing tools to cater to the needs of employers that are managing large temporary workforces.Jobandtalent gets $42M Series B after pivoting to mobilize hiring for SMEsThe flip side of the rapid growth of “flexible” platform-based labor — and Jobandtalent says it’s eyeing a pool of some 500 million temp workers globally — is something that gig platforms don’t usually like to talk about: Worker precariousness.But that’s something this startup says it wants to help with too. A key part of the proposition Jobandtalent offers to workers is increased benefits versus what a temp might otherwise expect to get.The average gig platform does not offer a full suite of workers’ rights and benefits, just as they don’t provide a contractual guarantee of future shifts, as they classify on-demand labor as “self-employed” — even as, simultaneously, they apply mobile technology to tightly manage this workforce (via data, algorithms and their own devices).\xa0This disconnect, between the level of gig worker rights and platform control, has led to a number of legal challenges in Europe — including in several of the markets where Jobandtalent operates (such as Spain, where Glovo continues to face legal challenges over its classification of delivery couriers, for example; and France and the U.K., where Uber has lost a number of employment tribunals over driver status).EU lawmakers are also eyeing conditions for gig workers — considering whether legislation is needed to protect platform workers’ rights. While some platform giants, like Uber, have already felt politically pressured to offer a level of insurance in the region.Jobandtalent’s promise is it’s pushing for more perks for temps — leveraging the scale of its platform to get workers a better deal, including by making precarious work more steady (by lining up the next gig) and therefore less uncertain.“All of the workers have access to the same benefits,” said Urdiales via email when we ask about how Jobandtalent’s perks are structured. “There are benefits such as advance payroll, health insurance, training courses, etc (not all the benefits are available in all countries, it depends on the level of maturity of each country).”“We want to give any worker that starts working through Jobandtalent access to those benefits and offer a high standard employment treatment, so they have a similar status to what a perm employee has,” he added.In a press release trumpeting its investment in Jobandtalent, new investor, InfraVia also suggests the platform makes “temporary work a fulfilling professional step” — by defining “career plans” for temporary workers so they can “progress towards permanent and rewarding positions”.However, when we asked Urdiales what data it has on temp-to-permanent switches that have been enabled by its platform he said this is “not a common thing”. “Employers are not looking to add workers to their perm workforces, and Jobandtalent is precisely trying to solve that for the workers, trying to give constant employment in different work assignments at different companies so they can find more stability,” he told us, adding: “The market is moving even more into a more precarious temporary employment market, and we believe that in this context a platform like the one that we are offering makes even more sense”.The other big carrot for workers to plug into Jobandtalent’s temp work marketplace is convenience: It takes a mobile app-based approach — offering a one-stop-shop for giggers to find their next shift, apply for the temp job (via in-app video interview), sign the contract and get paid, as well as access the touted benefits.Its streamlining of admin around recruitment and payroll is also of course a key carrot for employers to get on board with Jobandtalent’s “workforce as a service” proposition — which claims an upgraded offer (such as a CRM that bakes in analytics for tracking workforce performance in real time) versus traditional temping agency processes, as well as lower costs and increased numbers of job offers.Its worker-to-temp job matching tech is designed to take the (temp) recruitment strain for employer customers via a proprietary quality worker scoring algorithm which it calls a Worker Quality Score (WQS).Urdiales told us the criteria that feeds this score include attrition rate, absenteeism rate — and “some productivity metrics of the workers that we place” — when we asked for details, having found no information about the WQS on its website.Algorithmic scoring of workers can have obvious implications for worker agency.Nor is it without legal risk in Europe where EU citizens have rights attached to their personal data, such as access rights, and also (under the GDPR) a right to human review of any purely automated decisions that have a legal or similarly substantial impact on them (and decisions impacting access to work would be likely to qualify).In a recent judgement, for example, a court in Italy ruled that a reputation-ranking algorithm used by on-demand delivery platform Deliveroo had discriminated against workers because the code failed to distinguish between legally protected reasons for being absent from work (such as sickness or being on strike) and more trivial reasons for not turning up for a previously booked shift. (Deliveroo no longer uses the algorithm in question.)Uber is also facing legal challenges in the Netherlands to its use of algorithms to automatically terminate drivers and to its use of data and algorithms to profile and manage drivers. While ride-hailing company Ola is facing a similar suit over its algorithmic management of gig workers. So EU courts are certainly going to be busy interrogating the intersection of app-driven algorithmic management and regional data and labor rights for the foreseeable future.The European Commission has also proposed a sweeping reform of the regional rulebook for digital services, which includes a requirement for regulatory oversight of key decision-making algorithms with the aim of shrinking the risk of negative impacts such as bias and discrimination — although any new laws are likely still years out.Asked whether Jobandtalent’s worker users are provided with their own WQS and given the chance to appeal substantial decreases in the score — including the opportunity to request a human review of any automated decisions — Urdiales said: “The platform gives them constant feedback based on the main metrics that they can affect (voluntary attrition, absenteeism, etc) with the aim to make them improve at work and consequently improve their ability to get more jobs in the future.”Understanding Europe’s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook']",obvious reasons,"['NavigationClose ScreenJobandtalent', 'JobandtalentMadrid', 'Jobandtalent', 'Jobandtalent', 'LatAm', 'XPO', 'Santander', 'Bayer', 'eBay', 'Huawei', 'Ceva Logistics', 'Adecco', 'Randstad', 'Works', 'case.)Jobandtalent', 'LatAm', 'Juan Urdiales', 'InfraVia', 'Growth Tech Fund', 'Atomico, Seek', 'DN Capital', 'Kibo Ventures', 'Jobandtalent', 'Glovo', 'Uber', 'Uber', 'Jobandtalent’s', 'Jobandtalent', 'InfraVia', 'Urdiales', 'Jobandtalent', 'Jobandtalent’s', 'WQS', 'EU', 'Deliveroo', 'Ola', 'EU', 'The European Commission', 'Jobandtalent’s', 'Urdiales', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'LinkcheckmarkCopyTagsAppsEuropeFundings & ExitsRecent', 'Lomas9:00 AM', 'Jobandtalent', 'AustraliaAnthony Ha12:29 AM', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Artie', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"

But the news of a potential tie-up (however tentative) with Apple, which is known for keeping a tight lid on deals before they are announced, was enough to send shares of Hyundai Motor Company up more than 20% on the Korea Exchange during trading on Friday.The talks were first reported by the Korea Economic Daily and confirmed by Hyundai to Bloomberg in a statement that said “Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is at early stage, nothing has been decided.” The Korean auto giant also told CNBC that “we understand Apple is in discussion with a variety of global automakers, including Hyundai Motor. As the discussion is at its early stage, nothing has been decided.”A Hyundai spokesperson declined to comment to TechCrunch. Apple has also been contacted for comment.Last month, Reuters reported that Apple’s car initiative, called Project Titan, is still going on, with plans to develop an autonomous electric passenger vehicle. But the car is not expected to launch until 2024.The ‘Apple car’ chatter is back with new reports pointing to a 2024 launch dateHyundai launched its own electric vehicle brand, Ioniq, in August 2020, with plans to bring three all-electric vehicles to market over the next four years, as part of its strategy to sell one million battery electric vehicles and take a 10% share of the EV market by 2025. Hyundai also has a joint venture with autonomous driving technology company Aptiv to make Level 4 and Level 5 production-ready self-driving systems available to robotaxi, fleet operators and automakers by 2022.

https://t.co/UCtUVxgFeE,2021-01-08T00:44:01,Trump returns to Twitter with what sounds like a concession speech,"['It’s been a long couple of days for the country, but President Trump only had to wait 12 hours before returning to his social network of choice.In an uncharacteristically scripted three minute speech, the president denounced the “heinous attack” on the Capitol. “The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy,” Trump said, warning the individuals involved that they will “pay.”The previous day, Trumped directed a crowd of his supporters who had gathered for a “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House to march toward Congress. That event turned into a violent riot that disrupted lawmakers’ efforts to certify election results, wrought havoc within the building and left at least four people dead. As the chaos unfolded, Trump encouraged the rioters in a video posted to Twitter, telling them they were “special” and “we love you.”pic.twitter.com/csX07ZVWGe— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 8, 2021After yesterday’s video, Twitter locked Trump’s account and required him to delete a handful of tweets before having his access restored. Facebook later froze the president’s account for the remainder of his time in office. Trump is now on very thin ice with Twitter — the company said it may suspend his account permanently if he breaks the rules again.In the new video, Trump seemed to be aware that he’d gone too far. After exploring “every legal avenue” to stay in power, he backed away from a months-long crusade to override the will of American voters. Of course it’s completely possible and even likely that he’ll reverse course, sow more election misinformation and resume his dangerous quest to undermine President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.President Trump has had quite a few of these walk-back moments during his time in office, usually after crossing a line that makes even members of his own party uncomfortable. Yesterday certainly fit the bill, and even resulted in rare consequences from the social networks he relies on to communicate.Trump also appeared to concede his loss for the first time, claiming that he will willingly leave office on January 20. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power,” Trump said.Twitter will reinstate Trump’s account following his deletion of tweets\xa0']",Ludlow Ventures,"['NavigationClose', 'Hatmaker@tayhatmaker /', 'Justin Sullivan /', 'Erin Schaff - Pool / Getty Images', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'Trumped', 'Congress', 'Trump', 'Donald J.

https://t.co/95hiEKCepb,2021-01-08T00:11:22,Google AI concocts ‘breakie’ and ‘cakie’ hybrid baked goods,"['If, as I suspect many of you have, you have worked your way through baking every type of cookie, bread and cake under the sun over the last year, Google has a surprise for you: a pair of AI-generated hybrid treats, the “breakie” and the “cakie.”The origin of these new items seems to have been in a demonstration of the company’s AutoML Tables tool, a codeless model generation system that’s more spreadsheet automation than what you’d really call “artificial intelligence.” But let’s not split hairs, or else we’ll never get to the recipe.Specifically it was the work of Sara Robinson, who was playing with these tools earlier last spring, as a person interested in machine learning and baking was likely to start doing around that time as cabin fever first took hold.What happened was she wanted to design a system that would look at a recipe and automatically tell you whether it was bread, cookie or cake, and why — for instance, a higher butter and sugar content might bias it toward cookie, while yeast was usually a dead giveaway for bread.Image Credits: Sara RobinsonBut of course, not every recipe is so straightforward, and the tool isn’t always 100% sure. Robinson began to wonder, what would a recipe look like that the system couldn’t decide on?She fiddled around with the ingredients until she found a balance that caused the machine learning system to produce a perfect 50/50 split between cookie and cake. Naturally, she made some — behold the “cakie.”A cakie, left, and breakies, right, with Robinson. Image Credits: Sara Robinson / Google“It is yummy. And it strangely tastes like what I’d imagine would happen if I told a machine to make a cake cookie hybrid,” she wrote.The other hybrid she put together was the “breakie,” which as you surely have guessed by now is half bread, half cookie. This one ended up a little closer to “fluffy cookies, almost the consistency of a muffin.” And indeed they look like muffin tops that have lost their bottoms. But breakie sounds better than muffin tops (or “brookie,” apparently the original name).These ingredients and ratios were probably invented or tried long ago, but it’s certainly an interesting way to arrive at a new recipe using only old ones.The recipes below are perfectly doable, but to be transparent were not entirely generated by algorithm. It only indicates proportions of ingredients, and didn’t include any flavorings or features like vanilla or chocolate chips, both which Robinson added. The actual baking instructions had to be puzzled out as well (the AI doesn’t know what temperature is, or pans). But if you need something to try making that’s different from the usual weekend treat, you could probably do worse than one of these.\xa0Image Credits: Sara Robinson / Google\xa0Image Credits: Sara Robinson / Google']",Twitter locked Trump’s account,"['NavigationClose ScreenGoogle AI', 'Coldewey@techcrunch / 1:11 AM', 'Google', 'AI', 'AutoML Tables', 'Sara Robinson', 'Robinson', 'Robinson', 'AI', 'NewslettersSee', 'ReviewStartups', 'RoundupEmailSubscribefacebook(opens', 'Coldewey1:11 AM', 'Google', 'AI', 'David ReesBrian', 'Android Police', 'Classroom', 'toolsSarah Perez8:45 PM', 'Chen', 'Instagram', 'COVID-19', 'Zack Whittaker8:30', 'Fuel Capital’s', 'Leah Solivan', 'TC Early Stage', 'Georgia Tech’s', 'Advanced Technology Development Center', 'Locus', 'Gravy', 'paymentsSarah Perez7:28 PM', 'Yard Stick', 'Yard Stick', 'Blockchain.com', 'Twitter Sophie Alcorn', 'Global Law Experts Awards’ “Law Firm of the Year', 'Boldstart Ventures', 'Kustomer', '2021Boldstart Ventures', 'Microsoft', 'Xbox gamesDevin', 'Microsoft', 'CNBC', 'Ford', 'ConductRead AnywhereApp StoreGoogle PlayInternationalJapanFacebookFacebook(opens', 'Verizon Media', 'WordPress', 'VIP(opens']"
